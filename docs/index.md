To make your own themes, there's a [wiki page on how to make Nintendo DSi / Nintendo 3DS themes](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/custom-dsi-3ds-skins). For Original R4 and Wood themes, simply edit the images from an existing theme.

If you want your theme added here, [create a pull request](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/twlmenu-extras/pulls) on the GitHub repository.

If you're on a 2DS or 3DS, all of the themes on this site can be downloaded directly on console using Universal-Updater. To add the UniStore go to settings, choose `Select UniStore`, tap the + button at the bottom, and select `TWiLight Menu++ Themes` to add. Once it's added simply select `twlmenu-skins.unistore` from the Select UniStore menu to switch to it.
