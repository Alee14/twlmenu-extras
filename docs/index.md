# TWiLight Menu++ skins

Here you can find all the skins for TWiLight Menu++ from the [DS-Homebrew/twlmenu-extras](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/twlmenu-extras) repository.

To make your own skins, there's a [wiki page on how to make Nintendo DSi / Nintendo 3DS skins](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/wiki/how-to-create-DSi-3DS-skins). For Original R4 skins simply edit the images from an existing skin.

If you want your skin added here, make a pull request on the GitHub repository or send it and ask on the [DS⁽ⁱ⁾ Mode Hacking Discord server](https://discord.gg/yD3spjv).
