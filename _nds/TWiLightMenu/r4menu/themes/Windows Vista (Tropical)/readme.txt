1. Description:
--------------------------------

Love the new and stylish look of Windows Vista? I do too, so
I made this skin for the M3 Simply and the R4DS. I tried my
hardest to make this a very top quality skin, and I am 
personally very happy with the end result. The skin applys
all the the authentic aero effects, genuine Vista icons, and
a group of varying backgrounds to choose from. If you like
the backgrounds, but would prefer to make your own, I've even
created a kit with a guide in order for you to do so. I hope
you enjoy Simply Vista. As always, questions and comments are
always welcome; I love feedback.

--------------------------------------------------------------
2. How to Use:
--------------------------------

	1. Unzip Skin using Winzip or a similar program.
	2. After unziping, you will find a readme and a
folder named "_system_". Inside system, there will be four
bitmap images, an INI file and another folder called "ebook".
	3. To use this skin on your M3 Simply or R4DS, 
first select the four bitmaps and INI found directly inside 
the "_system_" folder. Copy these to the _system_/theme/theme[#]. 
You can use up to 12 backgrounds at one time, and use the 
Select button to change them. These four images will form the 
base skin and it's menus. If you have the latest firmware, 
it also lets you skin the ebook reader. To use this feature, 
copy the two bitmaps from the _system_/ebook folder, and copy 
these to the _system_/ebook folder on your card.
	4. Once these images are copied, your M3 Simply or
R4DS will be skinned.

	Note: If you happen to not have either of those 
folders, don't be affraid to make them.

	Note: To switch skins, follow this guide again by
replace the images found on your card. Simple as that.
If you really wanted to, you could also mix and match
various skins; go wild.

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Build Your Own:
--------------------------------

	Say you like the Simply Vista skin, although you 
would like to use your own desktop background, just like
the real Windows. I've thought of this and provided as many
resources as I could for you to do just this. I've worked 
hard to make it as easy as possible, but if you need help, 
especially with the more complicated features, please refer 
to this guide.

	Note: To use this guide, you will need Photoshop or
a similar program. My guide is following the steps you will
need to follow to make the skin using Photoshop. If you 
have something else, you will need to figure out the 
corresponding steps yourself.

		Note: No, Paint will not work. You need 
transparent PNG image and layers support.
		Note: I would suggest Gimp or Paintshop
Pro if you can't use Photoshop.

--------------------------------
3.1 Creating Skin:
--------------------------------

Use the following steps in perfect sequence in order to 
create your own version of the Simply Vista Skin. This 
guide uses Adobe Photoshop.

	1. First, unzip the MakeYourOwn.zip file.
	2. Inside, you will find a folder named _system_.
Open that folder. Inside, you will find similar images to 
the typical skins. Although, in Windows Explorer, they will
appear to have a white background. First thing to do is 
take the four PNG images found in _system_ and open them in
Photoshop. (bckgrd_1.png, bckgrd_2.png, icons.png, logo.png)
	3. Once these four images are opened in Photoshop
you will notice that they are actually transparent images.
For those of you that don't know what that means, it means
that if you put an image underneath the image, you will be 
able to see through certain parts. This is shown as 
checkered boxes in Photoshop.
	4. Now, the idea is to put images behind the PNG
images. All four images work the same way, so follow these
steps for all of them. When opened, there should be a layer
called "Layer 0". Take the background you want to use and
paste it into the same file. This will make a layer called
"Layer 1". Now, all you have to do is drag "layer 1" and 
move it below "Layer 0" in the layers pallet. You can do 
this by dragging and dropping, or you can select the top
layer and hit "Ctrl + [". Now you will see that the image
looks a lot like my images in my skins. If the image doesn't
fit right, take the Move Tool and drag it around. If it is
too big, you can go to Edit > Free Transform to size it 
down or rotate it. 
	5. Do this for all four images. Then, all you need
to do is save the images as a BMP. Go to File > Save As...
In the drop-down menu that says "Photoshop(*.PSD,*.PDD)
select BMP. Make sure the image is named the same as the
original, only with BMP at the end. (ex. logo.bmp)
	6. Hit save, and then select 24 Bit, and OK.
	7. Do this for all four images.
	8. Now, you may want to do the same and make some
Ebook backgrounds. Follow the same steps for the images
above, and create those.
	9. Viola, you are done. You've not got six custom
Bitmap images that will skin the M3 Simply or R4DS.

--------------------------------
3.1.1 Advanced Features:
--------------------------------

For the following skinning features, I am assuming you've 
got a good basic knowledge of Photoshop. Therefore I will
not go into the same detail as above.

- Making your own Icons:
-----------------------------

	1. Use the "ChangeIcon.png" image found in the
Advanced Features folder. Once opened, you will want to put
your three icons in the squares supplied. For adding your
own BGs layer, I would recommend save this as a transparent
PNG.

- Creating the Screengap Effect:
-----------------------------

	1. As you know, there is space between the two 
screens on the DS. If you want to use one image for the
top/bottom images and want to account for the gap in the
screens, open the "Screengap.psd" found in the Advanced
Features folder.
	2.Once opened, you will see all the backgrounds 
I used for my skins. Although, they have the 84 pixel gap
that I found works really well for the screengap.
	3. Just paste an image under the Gap folder, and
viola. You can change size and such with Free Transform
to get it to fit right. 
	4. To make selecting and copying the image you 
can use the Select layers found at the top of the layer
pallet. You can hit Ctrl and click on their icon preview
to select. Then just copy and you have the 256x192 image
you need for the skin bitmaps.
	5. Paste the images in their orresponding images:
		
   	Top: (logo, backgrd_1, and backgrd_1 in ebook)
	Bottom: (icons, bckgrd_2, bckgrd_2 in ebook)

- Blur Layer Mask:
-----------------------------

	1. This one is really going advanced. I highly
suggest that if you don't know what a layer mask is,
just ignore it. The idea is that it is a PSD of where you
should blur the images.
	2. Take your background image which you are applying
the blur to. Duplicate this layer. Copy over the 
corresponding LayerMask layer from the BlurLayerMask.psd 
found in the Advanced Features folder. Remember that black
is transparent and white is visible. 
	3. Use your Magic Wand Tool to select the black 
areas of the LayerMask folder. Now select the top background
layer you copied in an earlier step. Use the selection
you just made to create a layer mask.
	4. Now apply a 3.2 Gaussian Blur to the layer below
(the original background image). Viola, if done right,
you should get an have a blurred background behind
they Vista windows like in my skins.
	
	Note: If that was rather confusing, refer to the 
"LayerMaskBlurHelp.jpg" to see what is should look like.
If all of this goes right over your head, don't worry about
it, it is a more advanced feature not needed unless you
want it to look completely authentic.


--------------------------------
3.2 Making Preview
--------------------------------

If you have made it this far, I assume you've got enough
Photoshop knowledge to follow this. This will make a preview
just like the ones you say when you downloaded the Simply
Vista skin. Now, surely, there is nothing to keep you from
using this on other skins as well; Merry Xmas, make good
previews. 

	1. Open the "Preview-Overlay.png" image found in
the Preview folder. 
	2. Open the four bitmaps you created for your skin.
	3. Now, you need to paste those bitmaps into their
corresponding location in the preview. Be sure to line them 
up perfectly. When the layer is selected, you can use the
direction pad on your keyboard to move it precisely.
	
	logo - Top Left
	icons - Bottom Left
	bckgrd_1 - Top Right
	bckgrd_2 - Bottom Right

	4. Save it as a quality 8/80 JPG image. Viola, got
a preview.

Congrats, if you followed all the steps, you've got a full-
fledged Simply Vista skin. Be sure to post it on some forums,
or even in the thread which you got the kit. Please give 
credit to GCTonyHawk7 for the original skin and do not claim 
it as your own.
