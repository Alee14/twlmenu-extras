        INTRODUCTION [be001]

================================

 ~ THIS GUIDE IS NOT FINISHED
 YET! IF YOU WANT TO HELP,
 YOU'RE VERY WELCOME! ~

 Hi! This is a walkthrough for
 Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of
 the Chosen! As you might know
 already, the game is a remake
 of Dragon Quest IV/Dragon
 Warrior IV which first appeared
 on the 8-bit NES. That's like
 thousand years ago, but Dragon
 Quest never gets old. Ever. The
 coolest thing about the remake
 is of course that it's
 handheld, but there's tons of
 other good stuff too. For
 example, it features more
 detailed graphics, and the
 storyline has been a bit
 extended compared to the NES
 version. It's all pretty old-
 school though, so people that
 have been following the series
 up through the years should be
 pleased. Unless they don't like
 good games, of course. Happily,
 I do.

 Dragon Quest IV is quite a long
 game, which means that there is
 a ton of information I need to
 include in this walkthrough.
 That's really nice, but I'm
 bound to make errors here and
 there, and I'd absolutely love
 you if you would take some
 minutes and tell me about those
 errors in mail or on messenger.
 If you've got information that
 you think others could find
 useful, please don't hesitate
 getting in touch either. My
 goal is to make a comprehensive
 walkthrough with lots of useful
 information, and to do that I
 could really use some help.
 That would make everything
 nicer. Please?

 Anyway, enough sweet stuff!
 When i write guides, I usually
 concentrate mainly on getting
 people through the main game,
 and while doing that, I also
 list items that can be found
 hidden in various places.
 That's what those item
 checklists that appear
 everywhere in the main
 walkthrough are for. You know,
 so that you can tick off items
 you've found using a pen or
 something. So, as you can
 probably guess, I mostly like
 to maintain a more general
 scope, rather than going in-
 depth with mathematical
 calculations of attack damage
 and that kind of stuff. Some
 people like that, but I really
 don't. I suck at maths, and I
 totally fail at everything
 that's about using numbers.
 Honestly.

 I usually make these
 introductions a wee bit long in
 the tooth, so I won't keep
 rambling much more now. Just
 make sure to read all the
 sections under "Before Playing
 Dragon Quest IV" if you're new
 to the Dragon Quest series, or
 just want a quick refresher on
 the basics. It's smart to know
 how to do things before
 starting to play RPGs. I know
 that from experience. With that
 said, I hope you'll have a good
 time reading and playing, and
 that you'll tell me about it if
 you find my work useful. Deal?
 Ok! Good luck now, you hear!

        MAIN CHARACTERS [be003]

================================

 While playing Dragon Quest IV,
 you'll get to control lots of
 different characters. The game
 consists of several chapters,
 and each chapter has its own
 main characters that you will
 be playing as. During Chapter
 V, which is longer than any
 other chapter, all the playable
 main characters will join your
 party again. Except for their
 backstories and the events they
 take part in, the biggest
 differences between the
 characters are their strength,
 what weapons/armor they can
 equip, and what abilities they
 learn when leveling up. In this
 section you'll find a bit of
 information regarding the
 playable characters. As for
 detailed information on the
 characters' spells and when
 they learn them, take a look at
 the "Spells/Skills" section.

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - RAGNAR McRYAN [Chapter I] |
 |                              
 | The main character of Chapter
 I is a soldier working for The
 King of | | Burland. At the
 beginning of Chapter I, he's
 asked by the king to find | | a
 bunch of missing children, and
 bring them back to their
 parents. | | Ragnar is very
 strong, and one of the best
 characters in the game when | |
 it comes to using normal
 attacks. He also has a huge lot
 of HP, but | | isn't able to
 use any magic spells at all. |
 |                              
 | His powerful normal attacks
 and great amount of HP makes
 him an ideal | | character to
 have in your party during
 Chapter V. Ragnar is a tough |
 | nut to crack -- a real
 survivor. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - ALENA [Chapter II]         
 |                              
 | The Tsarevna (or Princess, if
 you want) living with her
 father in the | | castle east
 of Zalenagrad. Everything about
 her seems to be inspired | | by
 old Soviet. Alena is a very
 agile person that wants to do
 exciting | | stuff all the
 time. This makes the Tsar worry
 about her, and in the | | end
 he decides to keep her locked
 up in the castle at all times.
 Alena | | hates this, and ends
 up escaping from the castle,
 after breaking the | | wall in
 her own bedroom! Crazy girl. |
 |                              
 | She's incredibly quick (she
 often gets to move first during
 battle) | | and does a decent
 amount of damage, but can't use
 magic spells. Her | | agility
 makes her ideal for taking out
 the quick Metal Slimes who | |
 always try to escape after
 running into your party. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - BORYA [Chapter II]         
 |                              
 | A magic user that works for
 Alena's dad as a servant. He
 has known | | Alena ever since
 she was a small kid, and
 watches over her as if she | |
 was the most important thing in
 the world. Perhaps she is.
 Borya has | | potential to
 learn many powerful magic
 spells that can strengthen the
 | | other party members during
 battle. He's also able to
 teleport to any | | location
 he's visited earlier, which
 makes him useful, even if you |
 | decide not to put him in your
 battle lineup. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - KIRYL [Chapter II]         
 |                              
 | Another servant for Alena.
 Kiryl is a priest that has
 great healing | | spells, but
 poor normal attacks. Many of
 his spells are also great | |
 for giving temporary stat
 boosts to other characters
 during battle. | | He's not
 really the best choice for your
 Chapter V lineup, but his | |
 healing spells will come in
 handy during Alena's own
 chapter. Later on, | | his
 appeal is his wide range of
 supportive spells, and his
 ability to | | prevent enemies
 from using magic spells. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - TORNEKO [Chapter III]      
 |                              
 | Torneko is a big man that
 works at the weapons shop in
 Lakanaba | | Village. The
 business belongs to his boss
 though, and Torneko doesn't | |
 earn a lot. Because of this, he
 dreams about starting his very
 own | | weapons shop, and
 becoming the best merchant in
 the whole world! Being | | a
 man that listens to his heart,
 Torneko sets out on a quest to
 make |
 |   his dream come true.       
 |                              
 | Torneko will learn several
 useful skills, such as
 detecting hidden | | item
 chests and avoid enemy
 encounters. He also does random
 things | | while fighting, such
 as confusing enemies, or making
 them skip turns | | from time
 to time. Torneko doesn't have
 any powerful magic spells | |
 though, and by the time Ragnar
 joins you in Chapter V, he's
 not of | | your most reliable
 party members anymore. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - MEENA [Chapter IV]         
 |                              
 | Meena is a dancer who's
 father has been killed. She and
 her sister are | | on a quest
 for revenge. Meena is also a
 magician, and is one of the | |
 best healers/support characters
 in the game. Using her as your
 main | | healer is certainly
 not a dumb thing to do. Just
 make sure to keep an | | eye on
 her MP -- she's pretty useless
 without it. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - MAYA [Chapter IV]          
 |                              
 | Meena's sister. She's also a
 magic user, but her spells are
 mostly | | of the offensive
 kind. If you're looking for a
 character that does | | lots of
 damage using spells, this might
 be your best shot. Remember | |
 that Maya's offensive spells
 are powerful, but cost a LOT of
 MP to | | pull off time after
 time. One very useful field
 ability that Maya | | learns,
 "Safe Passage" lets you walk
 past traps/electrified floor |
 | without taking damage. Make
 sure to use it when you need to
 step on |
 |   dangerous ground.          
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 o------------------------------
 |                              
 | - HERO / HEROINE [Prologue /
 Chapter V] |
 |                              
 | This is the main character in
 Dragon Quest IV. This is you.
 At the | | very beginning of
 the game, you get to decide
 his/her sex and play | |
 through a short introductional
 prologue chapter, then you
 won't see | | him/her until
 Chapter V. The hero/heroine is
 a great allrounder that | |
 gets to learn healing spells
 and offensive spells. In
 addition, he/she | | is above
 decent when it comes to using
 normal attacks. |
 |                              
 | While all the controllable
 characters have good reasons
 for setting | | out on
 adventure, the hero/heroine has
 the best one of the all: He/she
 | | is destined to do it! Yup!
 Born for adventure. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

================================

       GAME BASICS & HINTS
       [be004]

================================

 - CHURCHES & CHAPELS: Role-
   playing games are experiences
   that last, last and
   last some more. So naturally
   you won't finish Dragon Quest
   IV in one sitting. When you
   want to take a break, head
   over to the last town you
   visited, and talk to the
   priest in the local church or
   chapel. Talk to him and
   select the "Confession"
   option. This is how you save
   your progress, so make sure
   to remember it! Oh, it's free
   too. In addition to saving,
   priests can resurrect fallen
   party members, and remove
   CURSE and POISON ailments for
   a small gold coin fee. While
   it's not really useful,
   priests can also tell you how
   many experience points you
   need to level up.

 - TAVERNS/INNS: In most towns,
   there is a tavern or an inn.
   If you sleep at
   this kind of place, all of
   your party members will
   restore all of their health
   and magic points. There's a
   small fee for doing this, but
   most of the time it's
   absolutely worth it! Never
   leave a town or village
   without sleeping at the local
   inn first. Note that spending
   the night at an inn does NOT
   remove any status ailments.

 - TOWN SHOPS: In most towns
   there are several stores,
   such as an item shop
   that sells healing items, a
   weapons shops that sells
   weapons, and an armor shop
   that sells protective
   equipment. Naturally, you
   need to pay coins to buy
   stuff, but you don't have to
   actually visit the stores in
   order to see how many coins
   their wares will cost you.
   Just press the Y button when
   walking around in a town, and
   take a look at the upper
   screen. You're now able to
   browse between the shop
   inventories of all shops in
   the town you're in. You'll
   find yourself using this
   feature a lot. Remember to
   buy new equipment for your
   characters often, and never
   go to a dungeon without
   carrying healing items with
   you.

 - DIRECTIONS: To use this
   walkthrough, you need to know
   the very basics of
   using a map -- you need to
   know what "north", "south",
   "west" and "east" means,
   since I'll tell you what
   direction to walk in very
   often. Since it's possible to
   rotate the camera view in
   this game, you should always
   make sure to reset it (Hold
   L/R at the same time) before
   following my directions. If
   not, you might end up walking
   in the wrong direction, and
   none of us want that at all.
   So, make sure to remember
   that...

      .-------------------------
      | (northwest) (northeast)
      |
      |                      NOR
   ...North is up...      |     
   ...South is down... | WEST
   EAST |
   ...West is left...     |     
   ...East is right...    |     
      | (southwest) (southeast)
      |
      '-------------------------

 - DAY & NIGHT: When you walk
   around on the world map,
   you'll notice that the
   game follows a day/night
   cycle. This cycle is entirely
   in-game, and has nothing to
   do with your Nintendo DS
   system clock. At night, the
   enemies you encounter will
   usually be different and
   stronger than the ones you
   meet during daytime. Another
   more important difference
   between day and night, is
   that some events can only be
   triggered during day, while
   others can only be triggered
   at night. Most events related
   to the main storyline are
   triggered during daytime, so
   if you can't seem to get a
   person to talk with you or
   something in that vein, make
   sure it's not night. In some
   rare cases it has to be night
   for you to do certain things,
   but rest assured, as I'll
   mention this in the main
   walkthrough. The usual way to
   change between night and day
   is to simply walk around on
   the world map, but in Chapter
   IV you'll get an item called
   the "Night Light". If you use
   it, you can cycle between
   night and day much more
   quickly.

 - SHINING SPOTS ON THE GROUND:
   Sometimes, you'll see small,
   shining spots on
   the ground. If you step on a
   spot like that, and press the
   A button, you'll find an
   item! In the previous
   versions of Dragon Quest IV,
   the spots weren't flashing
   like this at all, so be happy
   you've got the DS version!
   All of these shining spots
   are listed in the main
   walkthrough, just like the
   other hidden items in the
   game.

 - MINI MEDALS: At various
   places you'll find secret
   items called Mini Medals.
   You should try to get as many
   of these items as you can,
   since they can be exchanged
   for some really great
   equipment. Medals are found
   by breaking barrels, opening
   drawers or examining shining
   spots on the ground. Once you
   get Torneko's ship during
   Chapter V, you can exchange
   your medals at the castle in
   the northeastern end of the
   world map. Don't forget about
   this!

================================

        BATTLE SYSTEM [be005]

================================

 - BATTLE BASICS: The battle
   system in Dragon Quest IV is
   turn-based. The
   enemy encounters are random;
   enemies will suddenly jump at
   you while you're walking
   around in a dungeon or on the
   world map, without giving you
   a chance to avoid them. In
   most turn-based RPGs, the
   most agile characters get to
   take their turn first, and
   that's how things work in
   this game as well. In other
   words, the battle participant
   with the highest AGL/Agility
   status gets to move first,
   while the one with the lowest
   AGL/Agility stat moves last.

 - BATTLE LINEUP: Your battle
   lineup can consist of a
   maximum of four different
   characters. Once your party
   has more than four members,
   you'll have to decide who you
   want to fight battles, and
   who shouldn't participate.
   It's important to choose a
   battle lineup with all kinds
   of character types. You can
   change your battle lineup
   while walking around on the
   world map; just access the
   "Misc" menu and choose
   "Lineup".

 - EXPERIENCE POINTS: When you
   win battles, you earn
   Experience Points/EXP.
   Once a character has enough
   of these points, he or she
   will level up, getting
   stronger, more agile, and
   perhaps learn a new spell. If
   you want strong characters,
   don't run away from your
   battles! Note that all of
   your party members will gain
   experience when you win
   battles; not just the four
   characters in your battle
   lineup.

 - ATTACKS/SPELLS: There are two
   kinds of attacks you can use
   during battle;
   normal attacks and spells.
   Characters that don't know
   any spells are usually great
   at using normal attacks, but
   will need to be equipped with
   physical weapons such as
   swords and staffs. As for
   spell users, their offensive
   and supportive spells cost MP
   to use. When someone runs out
   of MP, they can't use spells
   before refilling their MP
   level by either sleeping or
   using an item. Note that your
   magic users will learn new
   spells when they reach
   certain Levels. Also, some
   enemies are especially weak
   towards certain spells, or
   towards normal attacks. It's
   smart to have both magicians
   and characters that are best
   at normal attacks in your
   party. This way, you'll be
   able to cast healing spells,
   do offensive magic attacks,
   and do normal attacks with
   one single party lineup.
   Variety wins. Always.

 - ENEMY GROUPS: When you meet
   enemies, you'll more often
   than not end up
   fighting groups of enemies.
   If there's several enemies of
   the same species coming at
   you, they'll be in one group,
   instead of having one battle
   screen entry each. This means
   that you often won't be able
   to target one certain enemy
   -- you'll have to target the
   group that the enemy is a
   part of, and hope that your
   attack hits the enemy you
   want to damage. Some magic
   spells however, will hit all
   the enemies in the group you
   target.

 - SILVER TAROT CARDS: I didn't
   find any other place in the
   guide where this
   would fit, and since it IS
   related to the battle system,
   here goes. During Chapter IV,
   you'll find a weapon called
   the "Silver Tarot Cards". The
   cards can only be equipped
   and used by Meena, and lets
   you do some random moves that
   may come in handy during
   battle. As a straight oposite
   to how things worked in the
   NES original, most of the
   cards' effects are positive
   in this version of the game,
   so try them out when you get
   the chance.

      STATS & AILMENTS EXPLAINED
      [be006]

================================

 - STATS: Under the "Attributes"
   option accessible from the
   main menu, there's
   a lot of strange numbers and
   status names. Here's a small
   diagram explaining what they
   all mean. If you compare your
   characters' stats with each
   other, you'll see that
   they've all got their strong
   and weak sides. Some
   characters are great at using
   physical attacks, while
   others are super-quick.
   Remember that your stats will
   raise/fall depending on what
   level your characters are,
   and what equipment they're
   wearing!

 o---------------------.--------
 | STAT NAME           | EXPLANA
 |---------------------|--------
 | HP / Health Points | The most
 important stat in any RPG. If
 you take | | | damage, you will
 lose HP, and when your HP
 reaches | | | zero, you'll die.
 You can refill your HP meter by
 | | | sleeping at inns, eating
 healing items, or casting | | |
 spells. If everyone in your
 lineup dies, you'll | | | be
 sent to the last place you
 saved your progress, | | | and
 lose half of all the coins you
 were carrying | | | when being
 defeated. If you've found the
 Steel | | | Strongbox item
 however, you won't lose any
 coins. |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | MP / Mana Points | Very
 similar to HP, but losing all
 of your MP won't | | | kill
 you. MP are needed to cast
 spells, and can be | | |
 refilled by sleeping or eating
 items. Make sure to | | | keep
 an eye on your magicians' MP
 meters at all | | | times.
 Without mana, they're useless.
 |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | Wisdom | Determines how
 quickly your character learns |
 |                     | magic s
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | Resilience | Related to
 defense. A high resilience
 level, | | | coupled with some
 good armor, means taking less |
 | | damage when being attacked.
 |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | STR / Strength | Strength,
 along with attack power,
 determines how | | | much
 damage your characters are able
 to do when | | | using normal
 and magic attacks. |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | ATK / Attack Power | This
 stat will change whenever you
 equip a new | | | weapon. Along
 with Strength, it determines
 how | | | much damage your
 characters do when attacking.
 Also | | | affects how likely
 your attacks are to hit the |
 |                     | enemy y
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | AGL / Agility | The character
 with the highest agility always
 | | | moves first during
 battle. |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | DEF / Defense | Having a high
 DEF stat means taking less
 damage | | | from normal enemy
 attacks. DEF also makes your |
 | | characters more likely to
 dodge incoming attacks. |
 |                     |        
 +---------------------+--------
 | LCK / Luck | The weirdest
 stat of them all. It affects a
 lot | | | of different areas.
 The most important of which | |
 | might be the ability to do
 critical attacks often. |
 |                     |        
 o---------------------'--------

 - AILMENTS: Ailments are kind
   of similar to the stats you
   can see above, but
   instead of indicating how
   strong/weak your characters
   are in various areas, the
   ailments are all negative
   effects that your characters
   might catch during battle.
   Ailments will make you weaker
   or damage you over time, and
   will only disappear when your
   characters die, or you heal
   them. If you catch one of
   them, remove it as fast as
   possible.

================================

      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
      [be007]

================================

 Q: Where do I find [insert item
 name here]? A: Search through
 the guide for the item name.
 You search by hitting CTRL + F.

 Q: What happens when I die? A:
 You restart at the last place
 you saved, with 50% of the
 coins you carried
    when being defeated.

 Q: What is the "Steel
 Strongbox" item used for? A: If
 you have this item, you won't
 lose any coins when dying. This
 only works
    during Chapter III, though.

 Q: In Chapter 2, what is the
 Thief's Key used for? A: You
 need it to open blue doors,
 such as the one outside of the
 Tsar's
    castle, and in the tower
    southwest of the Desert
    Bazaar. It's impossible to
    get through the game without
    having this key.

 Q: In Chapter 3, how much does
 Torneko earn when he sells
 weapons? A: About 1/10 of the
 total income.

 Q: How many chapters are there
 in this game? A: Six chapters
 and one prologue. It's
 certainly not a short game, if
 that's
    what you're REALLY wondering
    about.

 Q: I've got a contribution that
 I think would be useful in this
 guide! A: Great! Send me a mail
 or add me on messenger, and I'd
 be very happy.

 Q: I'm supposed to give/show
 someone an item, but when I
 talk to them, nothing
    happens, even though I am
    carrying the right item!
 A: Not to worry, this is a
 common question. It's not
 enough to just talk to
    the person you want to
    show/give the item to. You
    need to stand in front of
    them, then open your
    inventory. Now select the
    item in question, and "USE"
    it. This game is kinda old-
    school, remember :)

 Q: Lots of slimes often attack
 me at once! Anything I should
 know about that? A: Don't
 attack the slimes. Instead wait
 for them to combine their
 bodies into
    a King Slime. Now kill the
    King Slime to get a nice
    amount of Coins/EXP.

 Q: Is it possible to win the
 boss battle after defeating
 Balzack? A: Not possible!

 Q: Your English is terrible! A:
 Give me a break. I'm not a
 native speaker :(

 Q: Is there any point in NOT
 eating the seeds I find before
 Chapter V? A: Yup. If you spare
 the seeds, you can give them
 all to the hero during
    Chapter V. He/she is the
    most important character in
    the game, after all.

 Q: I found an
 item/location/character name
 that's different from the name
    used in the game! Why?
 A: I started writing this guide
 while playing the Japanese
 version of Dragon
    Quest IV. I think I've
    managed to get most of the
    names to be the same as in
    the English language
    release, but I'm not
    entirely sure. Please tell
    me about it if you find any
    name errors!

 Q: Are there any vehicles I can
 use while traveling on the
 world map? A: Not exactly
 vehicles, but during Chapter V,
 you will get a horse wagon that
    enables you to travel
    through deserts. Also, in
    the same chapter you'll get
    a ship that can sail at sea!

 Q: What is the point with the
 bag? I know I can store items
 there, but is
    there anything else I can
    use it for?
 A: All the items you put in
 your bag during the first
 chapters of the game,
    will be carried over to
    Chapter V, when the real
    hero of the game appears.
    It's very smart to put Seeds
    and expensive items in the
    bag, so that you can use
    them later in the game.

 Q: Who's the coolest in Dragon
 Quest IV!? A: It is Mary Lou!
 Cooler than either of us will
 ever get.

 Q: What kind of doors do the
 keys in this game open? A: The
 Thief's Key opens blue doors,
 Magic Key opens red doors, and
 Ultimate
    Key opens metal gates.

 Q: Where can I hand in my Mini
 Medals? I want rewards! A: Once
 you have Torneko's ship, sail
 to the small island in the
 northeastern
    end of the world map. There
    is a castle there. Visit it!

 Q: I can't seem to change my
 battle lineup! Why? A: You can
 only change the lineup while
 traveling on the world map.

 Q: What's up with Metal King
 Slimes and other metal-type
 monsters? A: When killing these
 fellows, you'll gain LOTS of
 experience points. They're
    rare encounters, though!

 Q: These metal-type enemies
 always escape from battle. How
 can I prevent that? A: Find the
 "Sands of Time" item, and use
 it during battle to slow time
 down.
    As for dealing serious
    damage, you should find and
    use the Liquid Metal Sword.
    As always, search through
    the guide (CTRL + F) to find
    out where to find it.

    ---------[wa001]---

 o-----------------------------o
 Hi! You've started a new game?
 Great | ITEM CHECKLIST | stuff!
 After doing that, tell the game
 | | about what sex you want
 your character to | Seed of
 Strength......[ ] | be (male or
 female), then prepare for the |
 Medicinal Herb........[ ] |
 adventure to start for real.
 You'll find | 3
 Coins...............[ ] |
 yourself in some kind of dark
 cellar, and | | a weird guy is
 attacking you! Not to worry o
 -----------------------------o
 though, the guy who's beating
 you up is
       just your trainer.

 I'm sure he's a nice guy too,
 but you won't get to know him
 very well now, as he actually
 just leaves you sitting on the
 cold ground. This kind of
 situation makes you want to
 grow stronger, I know, and that
 is what we'll concentrate on
 right now, really! Getting
 stronger!

 See, there are some bottles on
 your left side. Approach them,
 and hit the A button to break
 them! Inside one of them,
 there's a nice [SEED OF
 STRENGTH]. After picking it up,
 hit the X button, and select
 the seed in order to eat it. It
 tastes better than a Happy
 Meal, and boosts your attack
 strength! Nice. There is also a
 [MEDICINAL HERB] in one of the
 other bottles, but you should
 use that when you need to heal
 after taking damage in a battle
 -- not now. Head a tiny bit
 north now, break the crate for
 [3 COINS], then go upstairs.

--- VILLAGE --------------------

 Wow, it's sunny out here, and
 the music is o
 -----------------------------o
 lovely. Break the crate on your
 right for | ITEM CHECKLIST | an
 [ANTIDOTAL HERB] that will cure
 poison | | ailments when used,
 and start running left, |
 Antidotal Herb........[ ] |
 over that tiny bridge. Suddenly
 a frog | Medicinal
 Herb........[ ] | appears! It
 looks like a mutant, but | |
 believe me when I tell you that
 it really o
 -----------------------------o
 is not. The frog goes back into
 the dungeon.

 See that house on your left? Go
 in there and examine the bottle
 for another [MEDICINAL HERB],
 then backtrack into the
 training dungeon to see what
 that strange frog is up to.

 Madness! The frog has turned
 into a red-haired person. Talk
 with "it" to find out that you
 need to look for someone in the
 village. That's quite clear,
 isn't it? Head back upstairs,
 and go into that house where
 you found the last Medicinal
 Herb. Talk to the guy behind
 the counter, only to find out
 that he is actually your papa.
 Take part in the conversation
 (that means watching), and wait
 for the screen to fade out...
 When asked to save your
 progress, do so. At least if
 you're planning to continue
 playing this wonderful game.

   RAGNAR MCRYAN AND THE CASE OF
   THE MISSING CHILDREN [wa100]

--- KING'S CASTLE --------------

 o-----------------------------o
 Ok. Now you're a knight named
 Ragnar | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 McRyan, and you're in a very
 important | | meeting at the
 castle. Listen to what the |
 Medicinal Herb........[ ] |
 King has to say. Sounds like
 lots of kids | | in his kingdom
 have gone missing. Ok, that o
 -----------------------------o
 is all we need to know about
 that. Once in
         control of Ragnar, go
         take a look at the
 drawer in the southeastern part
 of the room. There's a
 [MEDICINAL HERB] there. That's
 the only item here that you can
 get, so head south, leaving The
 King's Castle. You're on your
 own now, Ragnar.

 o------------------------------

 Burland is a middle-sized town,
 with a few shops, houses and
 townspeople. Nothing too grand.
 Just right of where you begin,
 there is an item shop with some
 barrels outside. Break them for
 [3 COINS], then go look at the
 inn in the southern end, and
 break the barrels outside for a
 [MEDICINAL HERB]. Just west of
 the inn, there is this
 completely plain house. Head
 inside, and open the chest
 behind the northern wall. It's
 kind of hidden, but you know
 it's there.

 Congratulations, inside the
 chest there is a [SEED OF
 STRENGTH]! Eat it to boost
 Ragnar's attack strength, or
 put it in your bag if you want
 your hero to get stronger
 instead, in the last chapter of
 the game. I recommend keeping
 all seeds in your bag from now
 on, but it's your choice.

 Head outside again, and speak
 to the girlie outside. Her name
 is Aigenas, and she says the
 man in her life has gone
 missing! She has no idea where
 is is. Now that you're aware of
 her missing husband, go to the
 armor shop in the northeastern
 end of town, and head inside it
 using the door on the right
 side of the building. Upstairs
 you'll find a free [LEATHER
 SHIELD] in a locker. Now leave
 town in either the eastern,
 southern or western end of
 Burland. Of course, you must
 not forget equipping the shield
 you just got, so do that too.

 Now you're on the world map,
 where enemies will attack from
 time to time. Just walk around,
 fighting enemies until you've
 leveled up at least once. Head
 back to town, and buy the
 [HARDWOOD HEADWEAR] to boost
 your armor even more. If
 needed, heal at the inn/purify
 poison at the church, then go
 out to the world map again.
 Head northwest, into the cave
 that you'll see soon.

--- BURLAND CAVERN -------------

 The music goes totally
 mysterious on you o
 -----------------------------o
 here, and that's interesting.
 The cave is | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 filled with all kinds of weak
 enemies, | | primarily slimes
 that you should defeat |
 Medicinal Herb........[ ] |
 every single time they attack.
 No running! | 40
 Coins..............[ ] |
 Anyway, move east to find a
 chest | | containing [MEDICINAL
 HERB], then get a o
 -----------------------------o
 move on north. Ignore the
 soldier here, and continue
 north. Don't go up those stairs
 yet; instead go west for
 another treasure-containing
 chest. You like those, right?

 This one contains a whoopin'
 amount of gold! [40 COINS]!
 After getting a little richer,
 it's time to head up the stairs
 you ignored two seconds ago.
 The stairs strangely leads
 straight out to the world map
 again. Don't ask me why this
 cave doesn't have a proper
 exit. Out on the world map
 again, sprint directly east to
 find another town. Welcome
 to... Strathbaile!

 New town, happy town! Make
 haste down to the bank in the
 southwestern end, and take out
 the barrel there for [3 COINS].
 Now then, jump into the well in
 the very northern end of town.
 On the ground down there,
 you'll find [25 COINS]! You
 love that, don't you? You do!
 Well then, just east of the
 well there are some stairs
 leading into the ground. Follow
 them, and break the bottles
 inside for a [MEDICINAL HERB].
 As for the guy behind the fence
 down in this room, talk to him
 to find out that he has lost
 his memory. If you talk to the
 kid running around in the
 middle of town, you'll find out
 that he's not a bad man, and
 that his name is Agus.

 Also, have a chat with the
 woman living in the eastmost
 house in Strathbaile. She says
 that Agus was put in prison
 because of stealing bread. She
 also mentions that he can't
 remember anything. So, now that
 you've gotten all the items
 outside and found out about
 Agus, you should go into the
 inn. In the eastern end of the
 inn, there is a bathing room
 where a nun is trying to get
 herself wet. Examine the drawer
 next to her in order to get a
 set of [PLAIN CLOTHES]. They're
 not useful for anything other
 than selling, so remember to do
 that at the next shop you go
 to.

 Go to the school northwest of
 the inn. Talk to the two
 teachers to find out that they
 think all the missing kids have
 simply gone into hiding. Read
 the book sitting on the shelf
 next to the teachers. The book
 was written by the headmaster,
 and he says that some kids have
 been known to leave the town
 out of their own free will.
 Hmm... that makes so much
 sense! Just kidding. Just
 southwest of the teachers
 (still in the school) there is
 a shelf with another [MEDICINAL
 HERB] waiting for you inside.
 That would be all you need to
 do in Strathbaile right now,
 but before leaving, grab a
 [MEDICINAL HERB] from behind
 the church, and [5 COINS] just
 west of the herb. What you need
 to do next is to head back to
 the very first town, and tell
 Agus' wife that you know where
 her man is.

--- BACK TO BURLAND ------------

 Agus's wife, Aigenas, lives in
 the house just west of the inn.
 If it's day, she's running
 around outside of her house,
 and at night she's on the loft
 inside. Tell her about her
 trapped husband to make her
 join your party. Nice, you're
 now a small but joyful group of
 people, adventuring together!
 Terrific! Head back to
 Strathbaile now, and sprint
 down into the jail where Agus
 is locked up. Watch the cut-
 scene. If you've ever read
 DragonBall, it's kind of fun
 too. Agus tells you that the
 missing kids might be in a
 dungeon southeast of town, so
 that is where we're going next.

 Save your game at the church in
 Strathbaile, heal at the inn,
 and make sure you bought the
 two armor items I recommended
 to get while you were still in
 Burland at the beginning of the
 game. Doing all that should be
 more than enough to get you
 ready for the Forest Well. Just
 make haste to the forest
 southeast of Strathbaile, and
 jump into the well there.
 There's a whole dungeon down
 there. Almost magical, I tell
 you.

 o------------------------------

 Feel comfortable down here? I
 don't at all. Anyway, run
 straight west, and jump into
 the hole in the ground. There's
 some stairs at the bottom,
 leading up to a treasure
 chamber containing some nice
 loot: [SEED OF AGILITY],
 [MEDICINAL HERB], [15 COINS]
 and a [SEED OF LIFE]. Store the
 seeds in your bag if you want
 your hero to gain their
 benefits later on, or let
 Ragnar eat them if you want him
 to get stronger instead of your
 hero. Now proceed further
 upwards. You'll be at the well
 entrance again. Drop down into
 the well again.

 Instead of going to the western
 end, follow the fork that
 splits south this time. Ignore
 the stairs, and keep walking on
 the only path there is to walk
 on. You'll soon find a second
 set of stairs. Ignore them for
 now, and continue east into a
 new room. In here you'll find a
 [MEDICINAL HERB] inside a
 chest. After getting it,
 backtrack to the second set of
 stairs, and head downstairs.

 Run straight east. Ignore the
 voice that tells you that
 you're going to the wrong
 place. In the next room you'll
 meet a creature called
 [HEALIE]. Talk to it, and let
 it join your party! This is a
 really nice thing, as Healie is
 a full-worthy party member that
 can heal you whenever you need
 it. One healing spell costs
 2MP, but that's not a bad price
 at all, is it? Try it out by
 pressing X and entering the
 Spell menu. Go back to the last
 road fork, and head straight
 north. When you hit the wall,
 go east. You'll find yourself
 back in the room where Healie
 joined, but you're in the
 opposite end now, where you'll
 find a chest containing [580
 COINS]. Wee, you're kinda rich
 now!

 Go back to the previous room,
 and go to the very northwestern
 end. There is another chest
 there, containing [TALARIA]
 shoes! You need those in order
 to enter the next dungeon.
 Anyway, we have everything you
 can possibly find in the Forest
 Well now, so head back
 upstairs, and go back to
 Strathbaile Town.

 further is not | | a bad idea,
 but I won't force you at all. o
 -----------------------------o
 As for weapons, don't buy any.

 When you've got the armor, save
 at the church, then exit
 Strathbaile again. I hope you
 haven't forgotten about those
 Talaria shoes just yet, because
 now we're going to put them to
 use. While standing on the
 world map outside of
 Strathbaile, access the items
 menu, and choose the Talaria
 shoes. Select "use" in order to
 fly straight up to the sky.
 Like a comet that moves...
 upwards! Exciting for sure.
 You'll land on a tiny island
 just west of town. And you
 guessed it! This is where the
 missing kids are!

 As you enter, a soldier drags a
 kid down the stairs just in
 front of you. Mean soldier!
 Very mean. Anyway, remember to
 use Healie's healing ability
 whenever Ragnar gets low on
 health here, as the monsters
 are much stronger than earlier.
 Now, chase down the stairs
 after the soldier and the kid.
 Move to the northwestern to
 find a chest with a [CHIMAERA
 WING]. Charge down to the
 southeastern end of the room
 now (ignore the soldier) and
 head down the stairs there. At
 the bottom, go just north to
 find some stairs leading
 upwards to a small room
 containing a [SEED OF
 STRENGTH].

 Head back downstairs from the
 Seed of Strength. While
 standing near the stairs,
 rotate the camera (L/R buttons)
 to uncover a door leading west
 just below the stairs. Head in
 there to find a chest with [640
 COINS]. Go back to the previous
 room, and enter the gates in
 the southern part. In here
 there is a chest containing a
 [SCALE SHIELD]. There's also a
 staircase leading downwards.
 Head down there, brave soldier.

 There is a chest just northwest
 of where you start out after
 using the stairs mentioned
 above. Inside is a great
 weapon, the [CAUTERY SWORD].
 Make sure to equip it, as it's
 unquestionably the strongest
 weapon this far! Just east of
 here there is another chest
 with a [SEED OF RESILIENCE].
 Grab it, then go back to where
 you entered the room. There's
 some stairs leading downwards
 there. Head down there to find
 a healing shrine that works
 just like sleeping at an inn!
 Nice! Go back upstairs.

 Make your way to the very
 southeastern end of the room
 where a soldier is lying
 wounded on the ground. He tells
 you about the Lord of the
 Underworld, who has an evil
 plan to eat all the kids in the
 whole world! Muuhaha! Scary! Go
 down the stairs next to the
 soldier now. Talk to the
 creature in the northern part
 of the next room to start
 fighting!

 | DIFFICULTY: Easy

 | - As long as you have the

 Healie is in your | | party,
 this will be a piece of pie.
 Healie will automatically heal
 | | Ragnar and himself when
 your health gets too low. If
 Healie dies, use | | Medicinal
 Herbs to keep Ragnar up and
 going. As for how to fight, | |
 just attack Winky first, as
 he'll die after a couple of
 hits. |
 |                              
 | Psaro's Pawn's attacks will
 typically deal about 10-15
 points of | | damage to you,
 and that's not hard for Healie

 you let Healie join your party
 when you first met him now. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Nicely carried out, you are
 victorious, Knight Ragnar! The
 kids that were trapped in the
 tower will now join your party.
 There's no hidden items or
 anything in this room, so head
 back upstairs, and exit the
 castle. Travel back to
 Strathbaile to deliver the
 kids, just like a real hero.
 What? You ARE a real hero? Ok
 then. Once the children have
 joined up with their families
 again, this chapter is pretty
 much over. Put all of Ragnar's
 items in your bag now. Not his
 equipment, but his items, such
 as seeds.

 This is important, since the
 hero you saw at the very
 beginning of the game will get
 to use those items in the fifth
 chapter. If you want to, you
 can also buy equipment at the
 armor/weapon shop for all of
 Ragnar's money, and put those
 in the bag, so that the hero
 can sell them for money later
 on. It's your choice --
 whatever suits you is fine with
 this kupo. Once you're done
 shopping and putting stuff in
 your bag, head back to the
 King's Castle, and speak
 with... The King! Well done,
 mission complete! Make yourself
 a cup of coffee or a glass of
 soda, and save your game when
 asked to.

 Let's continue to the next
 chapter now!

================================

     ALENA AND THE JOURNEY TO
     THE TOURNEY [wa200]

================================

--- TOMBOY IN THE THRONE ROOM --
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa201]---

 o-----------------------------o
 The game now introduces you to
 Alena. | ITEM CHECKLIST | She's
 a big concern to her father,
 Tsar | | Stepan, now more than
 ever. The reason for |
 Medicinal Herb........[ ] |
 this is that Alena wants to go
 on a | Holy Water............[

 strength. This is a | Feathered
 Cap.........[ ] | big problem,
 since she's female! They |

 country, I guess. Your daddy
 won't change | | his mind about
 keeping you in the castle, o
 -----------------------------o
 so leave him alone for now and
 go upstairs.

 Chat with the people up here.
 They're repairing the wall in
 your bedroom, but it will still
 be damaged, the carpenter
 explains. That's fine with a
 tomboy like you anyway. So,
 head back to the throne room,
 and go downstairs from there.
 Head over to the kitchen in the
 western end of the hall to find
 a [MEDICINAL HERB] in a bottle.
 For a flask of [HOLY WATER],
 look at the shelves in the room
 in the northeastern end of the
 hall. Two items in no time
 isn't bad at all! Not even for
 a Tsar's kid.

 Make sure to talk to everyone,
 then go back up to your room
 now to find that the carpenter
 is gone. Open the drawers south
 of your bed for a [FEATHERED
 CAP] and a [MEDICINAL HERB].
 Equip the cap, then break
 through the wall that the
 carpenter "fixed" a moment ago.
 Now that you're out on the
 balcony, search the end of the
 balcony to find [50 COINS]. Now
 jump down to the ground, and
 just wait for Boriya and Kiryl
 to join you. Leave the castle
 grounds for the world map.
 There's a town just west of
 your current location, so go
 there now. How does it feel to
 be on the run?

 o------------------------------

 Does this remind you of Soviet?
 Not strange at all! Head into
 the weapon shop in the northern
 part of town to find an [SEED
 OF AGILITY]. There's nothing
 more to do in town right now
 (except for returning to heal
 at the inn), so head out to the
 world map again, and start
 defeating enemies. You need to
 get stronger and earn some
 coins, after all. While
 fighting, use Kiryl to heal
 your party members. Fight until
 your characters are at Level 5,
 then go save your progress at
 the church in Zalenagrad. While
 you're in town, visit the armor
 shop too, and buy [LEATHER
 ARMOR] for all three party
 members.

 With your game saved, start
 moving northeast towards the
 village you can see on your
 map. Getting there is no
 problem; you can actually walk
 on those brown mountains that
 look like they are blocking
 your way. Enter the new village
 when you reach it!

 First of all, jump down into
 the well north of the entrance
 to find a [MINI MEDAL #1].
 Afterwards, examine the
 graveyard to find a [SEED OF
 LIFE]. Now enter the house
 north of the inn for a [SEED OF
 AGILITY]. Talk to the couple in
 here to find out that Taborov
 Village has some kind of
 tradition about sacrificing
 women. Scary. Now head over to
 the big house in the eastern
 end of town. This is where the
 Village Chief lives. Break his
 bottles for an [ANTIDOTAL
 HERB], then speak with him. He
 says that he has to offer his
 daughter Anastasia to a monster
 that has been attacking the
 village.

 Tell him that you'll help him
 deal with the monster when
 asked. Before leaving his
 house, open the cupboard in the
 upper right end of his house.
 It contains a sexy, fashionable
 [LEATHER HAT]! Equip it on one
 of your party members. Head
 over to the church now, and
 talk to the priest. Make sure
 that you've actually saved your
 progress after starting this
 chapter, then tell him you're
 ready to take Anastasia's
 place, and fight that nasty
 monster. Some workers now bring
 a box into the church, so step
 inside it.

 | DIFFICULTY: Medium           
 |                              
 | - You should kill the two Foo
 Dogs first. This isn't too
 hard, if you | | just remember
 to attack using Borya's "Crack"
 skill. It does LOTS of | |
 damage to those poor doggies,
 even on Level 5. As for Kiryl,
 you | | should use him to heal
 himself and the others
 throughout the battle, | |
 while Alena uses normal
 attacks. |
 |                              
 | When the two dogs have died,
 attack Master Kung. He's not
 the toughest | | guy I've ever
 been out with, but you can make
 him even easier to | | beat by
 casting Borya's "Sap" spell on
 him. Do that to lower his DEF |
 | by a great deal, then just
 use normal attacks to finish
 him off. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 There's no doubt about who's
 the strongest gal around now,
 is there? NO! Your party
 backtracks to Taborov by
 themselves -- you don't have to
 walk there with them yourself.
 Talk to the Village Chief now,
 as he's waiting for you just
 outside his house. He thanks
 you, and says that the item
 shop has now re- opened, and
 that is has something that
 should be interesting for Alena
 and her two servants. Sounds..
 interesting!

 And believe me, it IS
 interesting! The item shop
 sells the [HUNTER'S BOW], which
 is a very powerful weapon you
 should buy for Borya if you can
 afford it. After buying it,
 sell Borya's old stick weapon.
 Sleep at the inn, save at the
 church, then leave by exiting
 the church in the northern end
 behind the altar. Once you
 reach the world map again,
 travel northeast to find a new
 town.

 Something weird is going on
 here in Vrenor. All the
 townspeople have gathered
 outside the inn. Talk to them
 to find out that they're
 waiting to see the Tsar's
 daughter. Since YOU are the
 Tsar's real daughter, this one
 has to be an impostor or
 something of that flavor.
 Before checking that out, go
 inside the house northeast of
 the inn for a barrel containing
 an [ANTIDOTAL HERB]. Now move
 to the western part of town,
 and go inside the house at the
 graveyard.

 Speak to the guy inside, then
 crush all o----- SECRET ITEM IN

 guarding. One of them | |
 contains [10 COINS]. Finally
 it's time | - Visit the chapel

 standing around east of the
 inn. He's | | found a letter
 from the kidnappers o----------
 -----------------------o which
 says that you need to go to the
 cave southwest of town. That's
 our next destination!

 Before leaving town, head over
 to the item shop and a buy
 [HARDWOOD HEADWEAR] for Kiryl.
 Buying Chain Mails is smart
 too, but like usual, I won't
 force you -- I'll just
 recommend it. Equip it, then go
 sleep at the inn. Once you're
 ready, make your way to the
 caves just southwest of town. I
 recommend being at Level 8 or
 higher before entering here.
 Time for heroic action!

 Go south at the first fork for
 a [CHIMAERA WING]. Proceed west
 now to find a chest with a
 [SEED OF AGILITY] inside. North
 of the chest, you will find
 [360 COINS]. Follow the path
 that starts in the southwestern
 end of the room in order to
 find a set of stairs leading
 down into the ground. Follow
 'em. At the bottom of the
 stairs move east. You'll find a
 fork marked with four pillars.
 Move west from the pillars to
 find a chest with [MAGIC WATER]
 inside. Now you just need to go
 south from the pillars, head
 west over some stairs, then
 open the chest found in the
 very southwestern end of this
 floor. Inside there is a shiny
 [ARMLET OF TRANSMUTATION] that
 you're going to want.

 Backtrack to the world map now,
 and get back to Vrenor Town.
 The next event can only be
 triggered at night, so walk
 around on the world map until
 it's dark, then enter town
 again.

 Go to the graveyard in the
 western part. Some weird guys
 are waiting there -- it's the
 kidnappers. Give them the
 Armlet of Transmutation, and
 wait for them to escape,
 leaving the fake Tsar's
 daughter behind. The girl
 explains that her real name is
 Anya, and that she's just a
 poor entertainer that likes to
 pretend she's the Tsar's
 kiddie. Anya gives you a
 [THIEF'S KEY], then she leaves
 you in shame. Poor girl. You
 should have quite a lot of
 coins now, since you've gone
 through the Vault of Vrenor and
 stuff, so get an [IRON LANCE]
 for Kiryl and a [CHAIN SICKLE]
 for Alena. Nice stuff, now
 you're really powerful!

 o------------------------------

 Just south of the Vault of
 Vrenor (the cave where you the
 amulet) there is a desert. Run
 over there and enter the bazaar
 which can easily been seen when
 traveling on the world map.
 Make sure to enter during
 daytime. Once at the bazaar, go
 to the middle of the area to
 find lots of barrels. They
 contain [SEED OF STRENGTH],
 [MEDICINAL HERB] and some....
 [HORSE MANURE]! Yummie! ^_^

 Get the [POISON MOTH KNIFE] for
 Borya at the weapon shop, then
 go collect a [SEED OF AGILITY]
 from the tent in the northern
 end of the Bazaar. With all
 that done, speak with the guard
 that is waiting close to the
 horse manure bottle. He says
 that the Tsar has fallen ill!
 That's your papa! Hurry back to
 the castle and see what's up
 with him. To reach the castle
 again you need to pass through
 Taborov Village again, and
 while you're there, go to their
 graveyard and check behind the
 upper tombstone to find a [SEED
 OF LIFE]. Now continue running
 towards your daddy's castle.

 Head inside the castle and talk
 to the Tsar to find out that
 his voice is missing. He asks
 you to go see some kind of old
 man that might know how to fix
 it. Head upstairs, then open
 the Tsar's room using the
 Thief's Key (this can only be
 done during daytime) to find
 [30 COINS] in his locker. Now
 go to your own room, and head
 through the hole in the wall.
 Jump down from the balcony,
 just like when you escaped at
 the beginning of the game, and
 open the blue door in front of
 you when you land. There's an
 old man in here, but before
 talking with him, examine the
 drawers in here for a [SEED OF
 RESILIENCE] and a [CHIMAERA
 WING]. Now speak with the
 oldie.

 The old man explains that a
 poet named Josef should know
 how to get the Tsar's voice
 back. Head over to the town
 west of the castle, Zalenagrad.
 Josef is waiting for you on the
 church's roof, so enter the
 church and use the stairs in
 the eastern end of the holy
 house you love so much. Josef
 is a nice man, and explains
 that some "Birdsong Nectar"
 will do wonders to the Tsar's
 missing voice! Thanks, Josef!
 As for where Josef got this
 nectar, he says it was several
 years ago, at the Desert
 Bazaar. Save your game at the
 church, and travel there again
 -- to the bazaar you go.

 Try speaking to the lady behind
 the item shop counter. You need
 to actually get behind the
 counter yourself to trigger
 this. She says that there's no
 nectar left at the bazaar, but
 that you might find some in the
 tower southwest of here. That's
 where we'll go next, so heal up
 and get out on the world map
 again. Go southwest and enter
 the tower there. Impossible to
 miss it.

    ---------[wa206]---

 I know it's really weird, but
 near the o
 -----------------------------o
 entrance of the tower there is
 an inn. It's | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 not a healing shrine or
 something -- it's a | |
 completely normal inn that
 charges 18 Coins | 1200
 Coins............[ ] | per
 night. To access the inn, just
 head | Seed of Strength......[
 ] | inside the door just north
 of the tower | Chimaera
 Wing.........[ ] | entrance,
 and walk down the stairs on the
 | Birdsong Nectar.......[ ] |
 other side. Grind for
 experience points | | near the
 entrance until your characters
 are o
 -----------------------------o
 around Level 10, if they aren't
 already. Now heal at the inn,
 and open the blue gates in the
 western part of the entrance
 area. Head up the stairs on the
 other side.

 Up here you'll find two chests.
 There's only one path, so
 follow it until you see them.
 It's totally worth it too,
 since one of them contains
 [1200 COINS]! The second chest
 has a [SEED OF STRENGTH]. Not
 to shabby at all! Head one
 floor down from where you found
 the chests, and exit this room
 in the southeastern end --
 there's some stairs leading
 upwards to a new floor there.

 There are some pillars on your
 left side. Ignore them for now,
 and head north to find a chest
 with a [CHIMAERA WING] in it.
 Now go back to those pillars
 and follow them west. You'll
 find a huge gap. Walk on the
 small path left of the gap, and
 follow it all the way until you
 see some stairs. Run up to the
 top. In the next room, just
 find the stairs in the middle
 southern end, and head up there
 for a short cut-scene showing
 two Elves that have some of
 that delicious nectar with
 them. They both escape, and
 leave the [BIRDSONG NECTAR]
 behind for you to keep. So,
 take it now!

 Once you have the nectar, use
 Borya's "Zoom" ability to
 transport yourself back to
 Zamoksva, the Tsar's castle. Go
 to the throne room, and while
 standing in front of the Tsar
 himself, access the item menu,
 and USE the nectar. The Tsar
 goes super-grateful, and allows
 you to leave the castle through
 the main entrance. Now go save
 your game at the nearest town,
 then use the Zoom ability to
 transport yourself to the
 Bazaar again. From there, head
 directly east to find a shrine
 near the sea.

 The shrine is actually a
 passage that leads to another
 kingdom, but it's been closed
 until now -- that is why I
 never told you about it before!
 So, throw your cute little self
 into the vortex in the shrine.
 Before you know it, you'll end
 up in the Kingdom of Endor! I
 wish I could try traveling
 through a vortex like that
 myself.. but that's not
 important now. I think.

 Welcome to Endor. Just
 southeast of here on the world
 map there is a town. You should
 be able to see it, actually.
 Head over there now. The town
 is actually named Endor too,
 just like the kingdom it is a
 part of. People around here
 must be crazy. Anyway, talk to
 the townspeople to find out
 that some kinda of tourney is
 about to start here. We will
 investigate that soon, but
 first we'll get some lovely
 loot!

 Step inside the manor in the
 northeastern part of town.
 Break the barrels in here for
 [40 COINS]. West of the weapons
 shop there's a bottle
 containing [ANTIDOTAL HERB]. On
 the 2nd floor of the shop in
 the southwestern end of town
 there's a drawer with a [SILK
 ROBE] inside. I know this is
 pretty boring, but bear with
 me... At the first floor of the
 inn there are many barrels. One
 contains a [SEED OF LUCK], and
 another contains [16 COINS].
 Just south of the inn (near the
 town gates) there's a barrel
 with [5 COINS] too, but you
 need to rotate the camera to
 see it.

 Great, now you're done looting
 the town. So, go to the armor
 shop and buy [IRON SHIELD] for
 Kiryl, a [SCALE SHIELD] for
 Borya, and finally a nice and
 shiny [IRON ARMOR] for Kiryl.
 At the weapons shop, get a
 [HOLY LANCE] for Kyril. That
 would be all; you should now
 have all the best equipment
 buyable right now. Go save your
 progress at the church. After
 doing so, head out to the world
 map again, and grind for
 experience points until Alena
 hits at least Level 12 -- if
 you don't do this, you'll cry
 later on. Once you're strong
 enough, go save your game
 again!

 Alright, time to rock. Exit
 town in the northern end to
 reach the castle grounds. Run
 inside the castle, through the
 main entrance. Go to the
 basement to find [3 COINS] in a
 barrel, then head upstairs
 again. This time, go to the
 castle's 2nd floor -- upstairs.
 This is the throne room where
 King Norman hangs around,
 smoking bad stuff... No, he
 just hangs around. Talk to the
 king and the princess to find
 out that they are both relying
 on YOU to win the upcoming
 tourney, which is kind of like
 a gladiator tournament. If you
 lose, the princess will have to
 marry a terrible manslayer! And
 we all know what manslayers do
 with cute princesses. Not nice
 things! God, no!

 So, let's go and prepare for
 the tourney. Exit the castle,
 and this time, enter using the
 door west of the main entrance.
 While running through the
 corridor in here, there is a
 small door on your left hand.
 Go in there to find a chest
 containing a sweeeet [SEED OF
 LIFE]. Now get back to that
 corridor, and continue walking
 until you're in a room with two
 green guards. Talk to the
 leftmost guard. He'll let you
 into the room where fighters
 prepare before fighting in the
 tourney. There's an item shop,
 a priest and an inn here.

 It's smart to buy the [IRON
 CLAW] at the item shop and
 equip it on Alena, and since
 you're a smart person (?) that
 is what you're going to do!
 Seriously, it boosts your
 attack power a LOT! Also, since
 Alena's two servants won't be
 able to fight in the tourney,
 but some Medicinal Herbs. Five
 of them should be enough. If
 you're low on health, sleep at
 the inn. Afterwards, you're
 ready for battle, so head up
 those stairs in the middle of
 the area, just below the item
 shop counter.

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Tourney Tools!
 | DROPS: [Medicinal Herb] x 3 |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Alena                 
 | MY LEVEL: 12                 
 | DIFFICULTY:                  
 |                              
 | - ATILLA THE HUNK: This is
 the first gladiator you need to
 take down! | | He's not really
 harder than the normal enemies
 hanging out around | | Endor
 Town, so at Level 12 or higher,
 and with the Iron Claw
 equipped, | | Alena should have
 no problem taking this one
 down. He'll hit the | | floor
 after about three or four hits.
 Now eat a Medicinal Herb to | |
 heal back to 100% HP. Yup, you
 actually get to use herbs
 between each | | battle. Kind
 of like a soccer game break. |
 |                              
 | - QUICK DRAW McGORE: Same
 fare with this one, but he does
 a little more | | damage, so
 you'll have to eat a herb
 during battle. So, attack until
 | | you need to heal, then
 afterwards attack him a couple
 of times more, | | so that he
 dies. McGore drops a Medicinal
 Herb too, when he dies. | | Eat
 another herb after fighting him
 -- you'll want to be at 100% HP
 | | each time a new battle
 starts, believe kupo. |
 |                              
 | - PRIMA DONNA: Bunny suit
 girl!! As you'd expect, she's a
 magic user, | | but she doesn't
 have much MP. So, at the very
 beginning of this fight, | |
 just defend yourself (her
 "Crack" attacks will only deal
 3HP damage) | | and wait until
 she has no MP left. Once that
 happens, give it to her! | |
 Give it to her GOOD! I mean,
 attack her until she goes down
 :) | | Just like the dude
 before her, she drops a herb.
 Eat it before the |
 |    next opponent appears.    
 |                              
 | - KNIGHT SAMSON: You like
 meatballs? Because here one
 comes! Samson is | | a typical
 strong, braindead fighter.
 He'll deal a lot of damage when
 | | he hits you, and the only
 way you can deal with that is
 to heal | | yourself using
 herbs. He has about 100 HP, so
 it won't take AGES to | | show
 him what girl runs this show. |
 |                              
 | - ABOMINABLE SHOWMAN: Who
 came up with this monster's
 name? You? No? | | Anyway,
 there are four Showmen on the
 screen, and only one is real. |
 | If you hit a fake Showman, he
 won't take any damage. Anyway,
 you | | should always attack
 either the far left or the far
 right Showman. | | The real
 Showman tends to appear at one
 of those two spots, rather | |
 than at the two middle spots. I
 wouldn't be lying if I told you
 |
 |    Showman has about 80 HP.  
 |                              
 | - PSARO THE PRINCESS-EATING
 MANSLAYER: You won't ever
 defeat this huge | | man! He's
 stronger than you for sure! So,
 it's a good thing that he | |
 doesn't appear! Wonder what
 he's up to -- doesn't he want
 to win | | the tourney prize,
 the lovely Princess of Endor? |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Since that mean manslayer
 didn't appear, you won the
 tourney! One small girl, but at
 the same time, the best
 gladiator in Endor! Yes! That
 is you! The chapter is close to
 ending now, so put all of your
 seeds into your bag, if you
 want the hero to be able to eat
 them in the fifth chapter. Once
 that's been dealt with, use the
 Zoom ability to go back to the
 Tsar's castle. Head up to the
 throne room to find that
 there's no one there at all.
 Try visiting Alena's room --
 that one's empty too! It's like
 a ghost castle, I tell you.

 The hole in Alena's wall is
 still here, so head out to the
 balcony, and jump down to that
 blue door. What's inside?
 Nothing! Head out to the world
 map now, in order to end the
 chapter. Great work -- we're
 making progress.

     TORNEKO AND THE EXTRAVAGANT
     EXCAVATION [be300]

================================

 Before starting this chapter
 off, please do note that you
 will only have ONE party member
 at all times, and this guy does
 not have any way to heal other
 than using healing items.
 Because of this, you should
 NEVER go anywhere without first
 stocking up on Meidicinal
 Herbs. You can buy those at the
 item shops found in all towns
 and villages in this chapter.

 Torneko is a rather large man
 that lives in a town north of
 Endor. Not the guy you'd expect
 as hero in a role-playin' game.
 Anyway, Torneko wakes up in his
 bed, and gets a [PACKED LUNCH]
 from the woman standing by his
 side. Equip the [LEATHER HAT]
 which is waiting for you in the
 locker right of your wife. Go
 outside now, and examine the
 barrels near your house. One of
 them has a [MEDICINAL HERB] for
 you. Head to the very western
 end of Lakanaba now, which is
 where you work -- at a weapons
 shop.

 You'll be standing behind the
 counter. When people come and
 want to buy weapons, just use
 the "Yes" option to sell them
 whatever it is they want. If a
 customer wants to sell
 something, always buy it from
 them.
  When you're done, your boss
  will come and tell you to go
  home after giving
 you your [SALARY]. Once outside
 of the weapons shop, go north
 past an inn to find the item
 shop. Check the northern wall
 to find a secret door. Head in
 there and walk upstairs for a
 [LEATHER SHIELD] that you
 should equip. Move back home
 now, and before going inside to
 your wife, break the barrels on
 that square-formed carpet north
 of your home for an [ANTIDOTAL
 HERB].

 o------------------------------

 In the entrance area there is
 some water. Just ignore it and
 head down the stairs in the
 western end. In the next room,
 ignore the switch on the wall,
 and head up one of the two
 stairways just south of that
 switch. They both lead to the
 same place. Follow the path
 down another stairway to find
 another switch that you need to
 ignore. Open the chest west of
 this second switch to find a
 [CHAIN SICKLE] weapon.

 It's weaker than the Cautery
 Sword if you have that one, but
 .-----. stronger than most of
 what you're currently armed
 with. | B | Alright, now you
 can press the switch you passed
 a second | | ago. Watch Torneko
 get washed away into a new
 area. Kinda | | fun to watch
 him struggle, isn't it? I think
 so. | |
          |     |_____
 Alright, once Torneko is able
 to walk again, head west at | |
 the first fork and go down the
 stairs. Soon you'll see a | 1 |
 huge circle-formed boulder. Run
 south from the boulder, head |
 | | east at the first fork,
 then go west when the path
 splits | | | again. Finally,
 head north at the next fork.
 The boulder | 4 | 2 | will now
 fall into the gap south of its
 original location, | | | making
 a bridge. If I went too fast
 there, and the | | |
 explanation is hard to follow,
 look at the ASCII drawing | |
 just right of this paragraph.
 Imagine that "B" is the | 3
 _____| boulder's original
 location. From there, just run
 from the | | lowest number (1)
 to the highest one (4). | |
            |     |
 Now just walk on the stone, and
 head down the stairway on | GAP
 | the other side of that gap.
 Well done -- now let's
 continue. | |
            '-----'
 Congratulations, now you're at
 the very lowest floor of the
 dungeon. There's two tiny
 boulders on the ground here, so
 take one of them, and use your
 big belly to push it up to the
 northwestern part of the area,
 past the gate and into the room
 with the safe. Once you and the
 boulder are in the safe room,
 the gate will shut itself.
 Examine the safe to get the
 [STEEL STRONGBOX], then push
 your boulder on the space that
 the safe was standing. The gate
 will open itself again. Exit
 the dungeon. Wooh!

 You're probably wondering what
 the Steel Strongbox is used
 for, so I'll tell you: If you
 die, you won't lose any gold!
 It's like a portable bank. So,
 while carrying the Strongbox,
 you won't be penalized when you
 die. Note that it won't work
 anymore after Chapter III,
 though. Before we go to the
 next part of the storyline,
 make sure you stop in your
 hometown to heal (by sleeping
 with your lovely wife!) and
 save at the church.

 Go south from your hometown
 now, and youll find a village
 in the woods. Enter, and take
 the northern path at the fork.
 Welcome to Shinnoack Village.
 Near the center of the village
 is an item shop. Break the
 barrels near it to get some
 [HORSE MANURE] and a [MEDICINAL
 HERB]. In the drawers of the
 house in the northwestern end
 of the village are some useless
 [BOXER SHORTS]. Take em and
 sell em later. In the same
 house, talk to the man dressed
 in purple, and tell him youre
 lost. When he asks if you feel
 like spending the night, say
 that you want to. The next
 morning, the villages gone.
 Good job, dear reader! Just
 kidding - this was supposed to
 happen. On the world map again,
 go southwest until you see a
 castle. Enter.

--- BALLYMORAL CASTLE ----------
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa303]---

 o-----------------------------o
 Enter the inn west of the
 entrance. The | ITEM CHECKLIST
 | innkeeper's drawer has a
 [LEATHER SHIELD] | | in it. Use
 the armor shop's back entrance
 | Leather Shield........[ ] |
 now to find a [SEED OF LIFE] in
 a barrel | Seed of
 Life..........[ ] | behind the
 counter. For a bag of | 70
 Coins..............[ ] | [70
 COINS], go to the weapons shop
 in the | Chimaera
 Wing.........[ ] | northeastern
 part of town. Finally, get a |
 Prince's Letter.......[ ] |
 [CHIMAERA WING] from the item
 shop. You'll | | need it to
 proceed later on, so make o
 -----------------------------o
 sure you get it now.

 Open the doors leading into
 Ballymoral Castle itself now.
 Once inside, sell the Leather
 Shield you found to the main in
 the lower left corner. You can
 also sell all other kinds of
 armor here, for twice as much
 as the original selling price.
 If you want loads of gold, just
 go and fight monsters on the
 world map, and sell their drops
 here at the castle.

 Anyway, talk to the prince now,
 in his room just north of the
 guy that buys armor. The prince
 begs Torneko to come meet him
 outside the castle at midnight.
 We'll do that! Dating is fun!
 Now go see the king. He's all
 upset because some kind of
 Architect man named Archie
 O'Tect is missing. That guy is
 supposed to repair a broken
 bridge leading to the Kingdom
 of Endor, by the way. Now that
 you know this, visit the
 dungeon using the stairway in
 the northern part of the
 castle.

 Time to pretend you're Solid
 Snake. Make sure the two guards
 don't see you (just walk behind
 their backs), and talk to the
 man who's trapped in the
 eastmost cell. He says he's the
 son of an old man in Torneko's
 home village, and begs for a
 Chimaera Wing. How convenient!
 You just bought one of those
 three moments ago! Give it to
 the poor prisoner. He uses it
 to escape, and says he'll meet
 you back in Lakanaba later.

 Remember that the prince asked
 you to meet him at night? Good!
 Head out to the world map, and
 fight monsters until it's dark.
 Then go back to town. The
 prince is waiting patiently for
 you behind the weapons shop, in
 the absolute northeastern end
 of town. Talk to his excellency
 to find out that he needs you
 do deliver a letter from him to
 the Princess of Endor. You
 know, the one you fought for in
 the gladiator tourney. Torneko
 receives the [PRINCE'S LETTER].
 Oh my! It smells of perfume!
 Wonderful~

 Now is a good time to go sleep
 at the local inn, and
 afterwards save in the chapel
 accessible just east of the
 castle's main entrance. You
 should save and heal very
 often, you know. So do that,
 friend. The next morning,
 travel all the way back to
 Lakanaba. We're going to check
 up on that guy we gave the
 Chimaera Wing to last night,
 remember.

--- SIT FIDO! MY LOVELY DOG! ---
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa304]---

 The man you saved is waiting
 for you in the o
 -----------------------------o
 northeastern end of the
 village, watching | ITEM
 CHECKLIST | his dog Fido. Talk
 to him, and tell him | | that
 the only thing you want from
 him, is | Full Plate
 Armor......[ ] | to borrow his
 dog! The man agrees, and Fido |
 Royal Scroll..........[ ] |
 starts following you around.
 Finally, a | | real friend for
 Torneko-san. He's also a o
 -----------------------------o
 very useful creature, and you
 WILL need him if you want to
 make further progress. To do
 that, go back to the village in
 the woods southeast of
 Lakanaba. You know, the village
 that vanished after you went to
 sleep there some time ago.

 Upon entering the village, Fido
 senses something, and rushes
 into a hut. Follow him to find
 that he's trapped a man inside.
 The guy is a magic fox, and
 Fido has blown his cover! Some
 seconds later, you'll find
 yourself out in the woods,
 talking to the magic fox. Tell
 the fox that you'll let him go
 for now, and you'll receive a
 [FULL PLATE ARMOR]. You can't
 equip it, so put it in the bag
 you're carrying.

 Once the fox has vanished
 again, the architect that's
 supposed to repair the bridge
 to Endor appears. He seems to
 have been spending some time in
 the forest, but now he's ready
 to go and repair that bridge.
 Great stuff, and all because of
 Fido! Give him a kiss on his
 snout, then go and give him
 back to his owner. Afterwards,
 head south towards Ballymoral
 Castle. You'll find that the
 bridge south of the castle has
 now been repaired, so use it to
 reach The Kingdom of Endor.

 Endor looks just like it did in
 the previous chapter. Sell all
 the junk that monsters might
 have dropped when you fought
 them, then go and see the king
 inside the castle. He asks
 Torneko if he wants to starts a
 shop here in Endor. Tell him
 that this is indeed what you
 want to do, and let him start
 considering the whole thing.
 With that out of the way, talk
 to the princess, and give her
 the letter from the Prince in
 Ballymoral. Remember that to
 give her the letter you need to
 SELECT IT FROM YOUR INVENTORY
 AND "USE" IT.

 The princess reads the letter,
 and realizes that her lover's
 dad (the king) is planning to
 attack Endor. The princess's
 dad (the other king) hears
 this, and gives Torneko a
 [ROYAL SCROLL] that he wants
 you to give to the other king,
 so that war can be prevented.
 Take the scroll with you, and
 go north to Ballymoral Castle.
 Give the king there the Royal
 Scroll. This way, war is
 prevented, and the Prince and
 the Princess get to marry each
 other. Nice! Before leaving
 Ballymoral again, speak to the
 prince in his room. He says
 that you need to tell the
 princess he can't WAIT to get
 MARRIED! Yeei! Go tell her!

 Oh, and after speaking to the
 princess again, talk to the
 king. Since Torneko has helped
 him stop war, he agrees to
 letting him start his very own
 shop in The Kingdom of Endor.
 Torneko's biggest dream has
 been fulfilled! However, you
 just have PERMISSION to start a
 shop. You don't actually HAVE a
 shop yet. Hmm... That is
 something we'll have to do
 something about! We need a
 SHOP!

 o------------------------------

 In the southwestern part of
 Endor, there is an empty shop.
 Go there, and visit the man
 living upstairs. He says that
 he's willing to sell his shop
 to Torneko, but not for cheap:
 it's going to cost you 35,000
 coins. Where can Torneko get
 that much money? Well, he can
 either fight monsters on the
 world map, and sell their
 stuff. As you might remember,
 the shop inside Ballymoral
 Castle buys armor items for
 twice the original price.
 There's another way to get
 money quickly though.. If you
 decide to follow this "other"
 way, make sure to buy a new
 weapon and some armor here in
 Endor. Oh, and Medicinal Herbs
 too, since we'll be visiting a
 dungeon.

 So, here is the plan: Simply go
 to the o---- BODYGUARDS FOR

 head over the bridge | | just
 east of Endor. You haven't

 Now you'll be | needed to hire

 so you'll just have to follow o
 -------------------------------
 --o the water, and drop into
 the gap you'll run into quite
 soon. After falling down, keep
 steering the raft left until
 you reach land again. Go east
 to find a chest with a
 [CHIMAERA WING] inside. There
 are also other chests visible
 here, but you can't reach them
 now.

 Run northeast from the Chimaera
 Wing, and head upstairs.
 Upstairs there is a switch
 north of you. Step on it to
 drain the water below you. Head
 down to where the water was
 before you drained it, and open
 the first chest you can find
 for [760 COINS]. You'll also
 see two barrels nearby,
 containing another [ANTIDOTAL
 HERB] and a [CHIMAERA WING].
 Move south from these barrels
 to find a chest with a
 [MEDICINAL HERB] inside, just
 south of a small bridge. East
 of this small bridge, there is
 yet another chest, with an
 [IRON LANCE] inside.

 Head over to the very
 northwestern part of the room
 now, and open the chest there
 to get a [HOLY LANCE]. Way to
 go! Close to the chest with the
 Holy Lance you can see two
 stairways. One leading up, and
 the other leading down. The one
 that leads up will take you
 back to the entrance of the
 dungeon, while the other one
 will take you to some chests
 you couldn't get earlier. If
 you don't need to heal or
 anything like that, head
 downstairs, and get on the
 raft.

 Now float a little northeast,
 and you'll see two chests. Open
 them to get [IRON ARMOR] and
 [STEEL BROADSWORD]. The two
 chests in the northeastern end
 have nothing inside. Ok, now
 finally float your raft to the
 middle of the room, and head
 down the stairs surrounded by
 statues. Down here you will
 find a real treasure, the
 [SILVER GODDESS STATUE]. It's
 worth a c-load of coins! Take
 it with you back to Endor.

 A man living upstairs in the
 northeast-most house in Endor
 will buy the statue from you
 for a whoopin' amount of
 [25,000 COINS], so sell it to
 him. Now you only need a
 maximum of 10,000 Coins.
 Probably less, since you
 already have some gold from
 earlier. To get the remaining
 gold, fight monsters and sell
 the armor they drop at
 Ballymoral Castle. Once you
 have 35,000 Coins, visit the
 old man that wants to sell his
 shop. Remember, he lives in the
 southwestern end of Endor,
 upstairs. Once you buy the
 shop, Torneko's wife and kid
 will move to Endor, and help
 you run this as a family
 business.

 Somewhere in this world, two
 sisters live. The oldest one
 named Maya is a dancer, while
 the younger one, Meena, is a
 fortune teller. The chapter
 starts with Maya dancing at the
 stage in front of a huge group
 of people. Everything goes
 well, and Maya retreats after
 finishing her dance. Maya's
 boss gives her [100 COINS] in
 salary. The two sisters have
 decided to leave the troupe
 they're performing with, so the
 next morning, you'll have to
 leave and start searching for
 the man that killed your
 father.

 Talk with everyone, and break
 the bottles near the southern
 exit for a [MEDICINAL HERB].
 Use the western exit to leave
 the house you're in. Head west
 into the theater, and go
 downstairs. Your boss is
 waiting down here, but he
 doesn't have anything useful to
 say. Break the bottles and open
 the drawer in his room for a
 [SEED OF STRENGTH] and a good
 looking [SILK ROBE]. Now, just
 below your boss there is a
 circle-formed room. This is
 where the stage is. Go in
 there, and examine the floor in
 the audience hall to find a bag
 with [80 COINS] in. Hooray for
 that. Go outside again, and
 take a look inside the house
 just south of where you started
 out.

 Upstairs there is a woman and a
 drawer containing [WAYFARER'S
 CLOTHES]. Don't equip them --
 they'll just make you weaker.
 Head into the inn now, and
 examine the locked next to the
 priest to find [20 COINS].
 Outside again, get a move on to
 the center of town where the
 church is. Enter the house west
 of the church using the two
 back entrances to find [5
 COINS] and a [LEATHER HAT]. Now
 that you've found all those
 items, go sell them at the
 weapons/armor shop to get some
 coins. While being at the shop,
 get a [HUNTER'S BOW] for Maya.
 Her sister already has a decent
 weapon. Exit town now, and
 fight monsters on the world map
 until it's dark, but make sure
 to not go too far -- you don't
 want to die.

 While fighting, make sure to
 note that Meena has a healing
 spell. That's mighty awesome,
 compared to Torneko's battle
 skills.

 Once night has started, visit
 the inn. Talk to the girl in
 the bunny dress who is sleeping
 in there. She says that a
 revolution has started, and
 that the old king of this
 country has been killed. Scary
 stuff, but you need to listen.
 Still in town, head over to the
 pub in the northwestern end.
 Talk to everyone inside, and
 head upstairs to find the...
 PUFF-PUFF rooms. In the
 southmost room, there's an
 [ANTIDOTAL HERB]. Well, that's
 everything you can do in town
 right now, so head back to the
 world map, and move north.
 After a short while you'll find
 a tiny village -- Aubout du
 Monde, the sisters' home
 village!

 If you talk to all the
 villagers, you'll get to know a
 little more about the sisters'
 dad, and the man that killed
 him. As for stuff you can
 collect, there is a [LEATHER
 SHIELD] in the house near the
 pond. There's a [SEED OF MAGIC]
 and a bag of [35 GOLD] in the
 westmost house.

 While being in here, exit using
 the door on your left to find a
 gravestone. On the ground
 nearby, you'll find a [SEED OF
 LIFE]. Not bad at all. Now,
 before exiting the village,
 talk to the old man in the
 northeastern part, and buy two
 [LEATHER DRESSES] at the item
 shop. Make sure to equip them
 both, and sleep at the local
 inn if you need to heal. Once
 you're ready, head to the world
 map. We're going to head west
 to check up on what that old
 man was preaching about.

--- EXPLORING THE WESTERN CAVE -
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa402]---

 o-----------------------------o
 You'll find a cave a bit west
 of the two | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 bridges that are near the
 village. Inside | | the cave,
 there's a labyrinth-like
 hallway. | Chimaera
 Wing.........[ ] | Ignore the
 guy that greets you at the |
 240 Coins.............[ ] |
 entrance, and go northwest to
 find a chest | Night
 Light...........[ ] |
 containing a [CHIMAERA WING].
 From the | Seed of
 Life..........[ ] | chest, go
 east and follow the hallway
 until | Sphere of Silence.....[
 ] | you reach an elevator. Take
 it downwards.
 |                             |
 o-----------------------------o
 Hope you're not scared of deep
 dungeons,
        because you're pretty
        far from the earth's
 surface now. Anyway, when the
 elevator stops, move west. When
 the path splits again, go south
 to get a chest with [240 COINS]
 inside, then go back and head
 west onto another elevator.

 This elevator leads down to a
 safe area where a guy named
 Oojam is hiding. He's one of
 your dad's students, and wants
 to join your party, so that he
 can have revenge on the man
 that killed his maters. Great
 -- we have three party members
 in our merry little troupe now.
 Open the chest that Oojam was
 watching to find a [NIGHT
 LIGHT]. By using this item, you
 can turn day into night and
 vice versa. Doing so doesn't
 cost anything at all, and you
 can do it as many times as
 you'd like. Take the elevator
 upwards again now.

 When the elevator has taken you
 up one floor, go to the eastern
 end of the room to find a new
 path. It leads to a chest with
 a [SEED OF LIFE], and another
 elevator. Take it down to rock
 bottom! Soon you'll find
 yourself at the same floor as
 you found Oojan, but in the
 southern end where a chest can
 be found. Open it to get the
 [SPHERE OF SILENCE]. It can't
 be equipped, but if you use it
 during battle, you can seal the
 enemies from using magic
 spells. You're going to need it
 later on, so be happy. Now, if
 you're lower than Level 7, keep
 on killing monsters until you
 get that strong, then go out to
 the world map again. Your next
 destination is northeast of the
 sisters' home village: Palais
 de Léon. Go there.

--- PALAIS DE LÉON & HAVRE LÉON 
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa403]---

 The new king lives somewhere
 inside this o
 -----------------------------o
 castle, but he's a big security
 freak, and | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 has locked all the entrances.
 Happily for | | you, Oojan
 knows how to lockpick like a |

 access to | Dancer's

 anywhere. Open the eastmost

 [200 COINS] from | Medicinal

 Chancellor's private quarters.

 [DANCER'S COSTUME] from | Fur

|  Scale Shield..........[  ] |
 The only one who knows is

 Chancellor! Weird stuff indeed!
 The maid on | | the second
 floor tells you that the o
 -----------------------------o
 Chancellor would probably
 reveal the King's whereabouts
 if you were to make a REALLY
 LOUD SOUND outside of his room.
 Remember that! You can't deal
 with it right now though, so
 get out to the world map again.
 Move straight north to find the
 town of Havre Léon. Enter town
 during daytime.

 - HAVRE LÉON -

 Don't you just feel on your
 body that something related to
 the issue you ran into at the
 castle is going to turn up in
 this town? I did. Start off by
 visiting the wharf in the
 northwestern part of town.
 Break all the barrels there to
 get [15 COINS] and an
 [MEDICINAL HERB], then talk
 with the man who's guarding the
 ship on your left. He says you
 need a pass to travel on his
 ship. Ok, no voyage on the sea
 for now, then.

 Sprint over to the jail in the
 eastern part of town (small
 building), and chat with the
 guy who's trapped there. He
 says that he was imprisoned for
 setting off a keg of gunpowder
 outside the Chancellor's room
 -- at the castle. He goes on to
 explain that he got the
 gunpowder in Mamon Mine, west
 of town. We sure want some of
 that powder, don't we? First
 however, you need to get some
 gear at the weapons and armor
 shops. As for my characters, I
 got two [POISON MOTH KNIVES]
 and a couple of [FUR COATS] for
 the sisters. Equip your stuff,
 buy some Medicinal Herbs if you
 want to, then exit town.

 Grind for experience until the
 sisters hit Level 11, then head
 northwest from town. You'll
 find Mamon Mine in the absolute
 northwestern end of the
 continent you're on. Once
 there, you'll see that gas is
 coming out of the mine. Can't
 be good! Sleep at the inn, and
 take the [LEATHER HAT] from the
 drawer after waking up. Go
 outside again, enter the house
 west of the inn to find a
 [MEDICINAL HERB], and make sure
 to talk to the old geezer
 sleeping in his bed -- he says
 that there is indeed some
 gunpowder stored inside the
 mine. Great, then we've got it
 confirmed!

 Step into the house in the
 northeastern part of the area,
 and open the drawer inside for
 a bottle of [HOLY WATER]. Exit
 this house using the western
 exit, and you'll find yourself
 just outside of the mine. Just
 left of the entrance there's a
 small building with a hidden
 door (rotate your camera!) that
 you should enter. Inside the
 building there is a [SCALE
 SHIELD] and [10 COINS] hidden.
 Grab them, then head back
 outside and into the mine!

 o------------------------------

 There's so much gas in here
 that the air's gone thick. It's
 not dangerous to breathe in
 here though, so you're safe for
 now. Speak to the man at the
 entrance, and break the bottle
 next to him for a [SEED OF
 MAGIC]. As always, either use
 it on a party member, or store
 it in your bag for later. Nice,
 go straight north now, and
 you'll find a chest near a
 water pond. It contains some
 [SILVER TAROT CARDS]. They're
 probably weaker than your
 current weapons, so don't equip
 them if that's the case. You
 need to be stroooong, after
 all. There is nothing in the
 western end of this floor
 (except for a corpse), so head
 down the stairs in the
 northeastern end. The enemies
 will go a lot stronger down
 there, so remember to use your
 "Woosh" and "Sizz" abilities in
 order to take out many baddies
 at once.

 Walk west after arrive at this
 lower floor to find some
 gravestones. The man here says
 that his friends are buried
 here, and that it's time for
 him to leave. Aaw.. that's sad.
 Examine the ground next to the
 graves to find a [SEED OF
 LIFE]. Strange place for that
 kind of item, isn't it? As you
 may have noticed there is a
 room straight north of the
 tombstones. Go to that room,
 and break the wooden barrels
 for [50 COINS]. After grabbing
 those coins, go east and head
 down the stairway.

 Two men are working down here,
 and when you talk to them, they
 say that you can just take a
 keg of gunpowder -- they don't
 mind at all, so open the chest
 in this room to get the [POWDER
 KEG]. Now you're ready to go
 back to Palais de Léon, but
 make sure to heal and save your
 progress first. You can do that
 in the small town just outside
 the mine you're in right now.
 You probably knew that already,
 though. Oh, and make sure that
 you're at least Level 13 before
 heading back to the palace.
 There's going to be a boss
 battle, you see.

 Once you're back at the palace,
 head over to the .--
 --------.------. Chancellor's
 private quarters, and "Use" the
 | |______| Powder Keg while
 standing just left of the | |
 Chancellor himself, but on the
 other side of the Y | C
 .------| his wall. Just like
 illustrated here ----------> |
 |______|
     |                    |
 Once you've used the powder
 keg, the Chancellor
 '--------------------' will get
 scared, and run out of his
 room. Follow Y = Use the keg
 here behind his back, and
 you'll see him press a C = The
 Chancellor secret switch on the
 wall! Once he's gone, hit that
 button for all its worth! As
 you might have guessed, a
 secret passage which leads
 directly to the king's chamber
 reveals itself.

 Talk to the king to find out
 that he was indeed the one that
 killed the sisters' daddy, and
 now he rules the country. What
 a sour fish he is! Makes my
 blood boil! Almost. Anyway, you
 have to kill him -- sad but
 true.

 | - The King has morphed his

 the battle by using the "Sphere

 found after Oojam joined your
 party, in order to seal off
 Balzack's | | magic abilities
 for some turns. If the effect
 wears off, use the | | Sphere
 of Silence again. You don't
 want him to use magic attacks.
 |
 |                              
 | Once his magic has been
 disabled, use Maya's "Sap"
 ability to lower | | his DEF,
 then just start attacking him
 with normal attacks. He'll | |
 take lots of damage now, and

 much anyone, as long as your
 level is high enough. If you |
 | need to heal someone, just
 use Meena's healing ability. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Great! Balzack goes down with a
 BOOM! When he's been defeated,
 the lion statue behind him
 turns into a huge blue monster
 lion. The lion says that Lord
 Psaro won't be satisfied when
 he hears about Balzack's
 failure, and Balzack begs for
 the lion to keep his mouth shut
 about what just happened. The
 next moment, the blue lion
 attacks you! Holy molly, here's
 another battle! It's not going
 to be a good experience for the
 sister though, as winning this
 battle is impossible. Just let
 the monster lion hit you hard a
 couple of times. Ouch, you go
 down!

 Some hours pass, then he
 sisters wake up in a prison
 cell. An old man starts talking
 to them, and explains that he's
 the real king of the country,
 and that everyone seems to
 think he's dead. The real king
 explains that you don't have a
 chance at defeating the monster
 lion yet, and that you need to
 leave the country. He's
 prepared for this to happen.
 Break all the barrels in the
 prison cell to get a [SEED OF
 STRENGTH], then leave through
 the hole in the wall. Open the
 chest in the next room to get
 the [BOARDING PASS]. Wooh, now
 you can travel on that ship at
 the wharf! Super-cool. Keep on
 walking until you find yourself
 right outside the palace gates.

 Unfortunately, a soldier spots
 your party. Oojam is a great
 guy though, and starts fighting
 a hopeless battle against all
 the soldiers, so that the
 sisters can escape. That's
 sad... Run out to the world
 map, and walk north towards
 Havre Léon. Buy some [MEDICINAL
 HERBS] and put them in your bag
 along with all the seeds you
 might have there, since the
 hero of the game will meet up
 with the sisters pretty early
 in the next chapter. Board the
 ship that's docked at the wharf
 now, and head downstairs.
 Inside one of the barrels there
 is a [SEED OF MAGIC]. Put it in
 your bag. Talk to the captain
 of the ship once you're ready
 to end the chapter.

 Hi again. You're just about to

 referring to the character you
 created at the beginning of the
 game as the "Hero" throughout
 this chapter. All the other
 characters have names defined
 by the game, but the "Hero"
 carries the name you gave
 him/her at the beginning of the
 game. Alright then, let's
 party!

--- MY HOME VILLAGE! ZERGED!! --

 o------------------------------

 Who is "The Chosen", you ask?
 Why, it's the character you
 named at the very beginning of
 the game, before Ragnar's
 chapter. He/she lives in a tiny
 mountain village with his
 parents -- it almost feels like
 the beginning of an entirely
 different RPG, doesn't it?
 Agree or disagree with me, then
 talk with your mom. She gives
 you a [PACKED LUNCH] that drips
 of fat, and tells you to bring
 it to your daddy, who's gone
 fishing. Head outside, and
 check the inn just right of
 your house. The innkeeper has
 broken one of the village's
 unwritten rules, and let a
 stranger stay here. It's a
 poet. Talk to him while at the
 inn, then go outside again.
 Your dad is waiting for you
 just north of your home, trying
 to catch fresh fish from the
 river. Give him the lunch, and
 listen to him preaching about
 how to lead a good life. After
 listening to him, speak with
 your friend, who's sitting on
 the ground outside of your
 house.

 Now that you've completed your
 mom's errand, head back and
 talk to her, and make her give
 you something to eat. YUM!
 Calories! Just when you're
 about to start stuffing your
 face, the innkeeper runs into
 your house, shouting to you
 that monsters have attacked the
 village! Leave mommy behind and
 follow the innkeeper while the
 other villagers try to fend off
 the baddies. While escaping,
 your dad stops you, and tells
 you that he and your mom aren't
 your real parents. You're part
 of something big... something
 that has been kept secret from
 you until now. What could it
 be!? You won't get to know yet,
 so follow your trainer down
 into the training dungeon.

 Just before you gain control of
 yourself again, your trainer
 gives you the [BIG BOOK OF
 BEASTS], which is a book where
 all the monsters you encounter
 will appear. Just stand around
 and wait after your trainer
 leaves, and watch your friend
 morph her own body into what
 looks exactly like you. She
 saved you from the monsters by
 giving them her own life... :(

 Once all the noise has stopped,
 leave the training dungeon to
 find your home village
 completely destroyed. Poison on
 the ground, flames burning all
 the houses down, and worst of
 all: all your friends are gone.
 For this, you shall have
 revenge... Revenge of the sour
 kind. Before leaving what
 little is left of the village,
 look at the ground just right
 of where your house used to be.
 There is something shining on
 the ground, its a [FEATHERED
 CAP]. Take it with you, and
 leave the village. Head south
 to find a small hut.

 - WOODCUTTER'S HUT / CASABRANCA
   -

 There is a tombstone outside of
 the hut, and on the ground near
 it is a [SEED OF LIFE]. Eat it,
 then go inside the hut to find
 [50 COINS] and a [MEDICINAL
 HERB]. Oh, and theres a
 [LEATHER ARMOR] in there too,
 in the locker. The guy living
 in the hut will let you sleep
 here to regain HP/MP, so this
 is a great place for raising
 your strength a little. Fight
 monsters until you hit Level 3,
 and then sleep in the hut to
 get back to tip-top shape.
 Leave the hut, and go to the
 castle town south of here -
 Casabranca.

 At the entrance, three
 adventurers will ask you to
 join them, but then they
 realize their party is already
 full. There are some [PLAIN
 CLOTHES] in a drawer in the
 house east of the inn. Get
 them, then go speak with the
 King and his daughter. The King
 wants you to explore the world,
 and gather information about
 Psaro, the Devil King. His
 daughter suggests for you to
 visit Endor. Thats a good
 idea. But before going there,
 you might want to enter
 Casabranca at night, and talk
 to the old man near the lake.

 He tells you the sad story
 about the man who owns the hut
 you slept in last night. I shed
 a tear myself. Gather your
 feelings, and head southwest on
 the world map. Youll find the
 cave that Torneko made in
 Chapter III. At the end of the
 tunnel, talk to the old man. He
 wants you to find Torneko.

 - ENDOR -

 Alright. Head over to Endor
 now, and use the eastmost
 castle entrance to reach the
 gladiator arena where someones
 being married. Its the Prince
 and Princess you helped out
 earlier in the game. Watch them
 kiss, then go back to Endor
 Town. Speak to the girl outside
 the church, and pay her 10
 Coins for reading your fortune.
 The girl is actually Meena from
 Chapter IV, and when she sees
 your future, she hands the
 coins back to you, and joins
 your party. Meena goes on to
 explain that your destiny is to
 defeat the evil demon king, and
 to do that, you need help from
 a group of special people. You
 know, Torneko, Ragnar, the
 sisters and those people - The
 Chosen Ones!

 In order to get Meena's sister
 to join you, visit the casino.
 You'll find it in the basement
 of the bar. The sister's name
 is Maya. Let her equip the
 Feathered Hat you found
 earlier. Now that both sisters
 have joined your party, you'll
 see that their stats and items
 are the same as when you
 completed Chapter IV. Anyway,
 now that you have the sisters
 on your team, save your game,
 and start griding enemies at
 the world map. Once the hero
 hits Level 7, you're more than
 ready to start reading the next
 section!

--- TWO SISTERS ON YOUR TEAM ---
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa502]---

 With the sisters in your party,
 and the o
 -----------------------------o
 hero at Level 6 or more, head
 back into the | ITEM CHECKLIST
 | tunnel east of Endor. When
 you try to walk | | through it,
 a guard stops you and explains
 | 100 Casino Coins......[ ] |
 you're the 1000nd person that
 tries to pass | Scale
 Shield..........[ ] | through!
 Cool!? The prize you get is...
 | Hunter's Bow..........[ ] |
 [100 CASINO COINS]. | Antidotal
 Herb........[ ] |
|  Packed Lunch..........[  ] |
 If you want to go and spend
 them at the | 15
 Coins..............[ ] | casino
 you can do so. When you're done
 (or | Symbol of Faith.......[ ]
 | if you don't want to gamble),
 stop at | Mary
 Lou..............[ ] |
 Casabranca Town to get a [SCALE
 SHIELD] and | | a [HUNTER'S
 BOW] for the hero, then run o
 -----------------------------o
 straight east from Casabranca,
 on the world map. After a short
 while you will see a house on
 the world map, just south of
 where you're walking, so go
 there to see what kind of place
 that is.

 - DESERT INN -

 The house you saw is actually
 an inn, and outside is there is
 a horse and a barrel containing
 one of those [ANTIDOTAL HERB]
 items. Take it, then go inside.
 Loot the inn for a [PACKED
 LUNCH], [15 COINS], then speak
 to the dude sitting on the
 chair in the middle of the inn.
 The dude is the one that owns
 the horse wagon outside, and
 you need that wagon if you want
 to travel through the desert
 later on. When he asks you to
 get outta here, tell him "No".
 The dude now tells you a story
 from his younger days, when he
 went to a certain cave with a
 friend to search for treasure.
 When the two of them found the
 goods, his friend stabbed him
 in the back! It's not weird
 he's cranky, is it? After
 listening to his story, leave
 the inn. We're going to find
 that cave! It's not hidden at
 all; just walk straight east
 from the inn. After passing
 three or four bridges, you'll
 see it.

 - CAVE OF BETRAYAL -

 Head inside the cave, and break
 the stone wall at the entrance.
 KA-BOOSH!! Alrightie, proceed
 through the hallway, and keep
 walking until the two
 sisters... fall through the
 floor! God! You're alone now.
 There's a door south of here,
 but one person alone can't open
 it. So, head downstairs
 instead. You'll see the
 sisters, but they don't see
 you, and leave in the wrong
 direction. Follow them west.
 When you catch up to them,
 you'll realize that they're not
 the sisters, but MONSTERS! Kill
 them! Kill them good!! Remember
 to heal yourself during this
 battle, so that you're not the
 one that dies. After the
 battle, you'll fall through the
 floor. Make sure to heal if
 you're low on HP, then talk to
 the sisters you can see running
 around in front of you. Once
 again, they're not the real
 sisters, but bad, bad, bad
 baddies. Kill 'em off!

 Head up the stairs east of
 where you killed the baddies.
 You'll see another pair of
 sisters, so run over to them.
 They think you're a monster,
 and will ask you a question to
 see if you're the real hero.
 When asked if Meena was the one
 that was gambling in Endor,
 answer "No". The sisters will
 join you again now. Head a tiny
 bit north, and head up the
 stairs on your right side to
 find another steel door. Open
 it. Now just keep walking until
 you reach the place where the
 sisters fell down at the
 beginning of the cave.

 Go south from here until you
 find a room with lots of stone
 blocks surrounding a square of
 pavement. Break the blocks, and
 move over to the northern side
 of the pavement square. There's
 a hidden door here -- you can
 actually walk into the square,
 as if it were a house. Inside,
 there is a chest containing the
 [SYMBOL OF FAITH]. This is
 exactly what the dude at the
 inn wants from you. So, head
 back to the inn east of
 Casabranca, and give the symbol
 to him. To your big surprise
 the dude -- Hank Hoffman Junior
 -- joins your party! He takes
 his horse with him too, so now
 you can travel through the
 desert south of the inn. Very
 nice. Gotta love the horse,
 {MARY LOU}!

--- THROUGH THE DESERT ---------
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa503]---

 o-----------------------------o
 There won't be an Axl Rose-
 style welcoming | ITEM
 CHECKLIST | for you, but I can
 tell you that you're in | | the
 desert now. And you're NOT
 going to | Leather
 Shield........[ ] | die. The
 enemies here are a bit stronger
 | Seed of Strength......[ ] |
 than earlier, so fight them
 until the hero | Mini Medal
 #2.........[ ] | hits Level 10,
 then start traveling south | 50
 Coins..............[ ] |
 through the desert. In the very
 southern | Holy
 Lance............[ ] | end,
 there is a path that leads out
 of the | Iron
 Armors...........[ ] | desert.
 Follow it to reach Bath Town. |
 Mini Medal #3.........[ ] | |
 15 Coins..............[ ] | -
 BATH - | Seed of
 Strength......[ ] | | Antidotal
 Herb........[ ] | Talk to the
 man with the ox helmet at the |
 Boxer Shorts..........[ ] |
 entrance. When he offers to
 give you a tour | Mini Medal
 #4.........[ ] | around town,
 agree. Let him take you into |
 7 Coins...............[ ] | the
 local church, where a famous
 armor set | Mini Medal
 5..........[ ] | is kept --
 it's Bath's treasure. The tour
 | Wayfarer's Clothes....[ ] |
 stops at the inn, since the man
 in the ox | | helmet is
 actually the innkeeper. Follow
 o-----------------------------o
 him into the inn, and open the
 drawer in there for a [LEATHER
 SHIELD].

 Your next stop should be at the
 graveyard in the northern part
 of town, where you can find a
 [SEED OF STRENGTH] on the
 ground. Now head over to the
 hot spring, and open the drawer
 there to get a medal, [MINI
 MEDAL #2]. Next, go to the
 weapons shop to find [50
 COINS]. While there, buy a
 [HOLY LANCE] for Meena, and get
 two [IRON ARMORS] at the armor
 shop. Let the hero and Meena
 equip them. Now go and save
 your game at the church. Sleep
 at the inn, then leave town.
 Travel south to find a place
 named Porthtrunnel, a port
 town.

 - PORTHTRUNNEL -

 Head over to the docks in the
 western end. There are lots of
 ships here, and lots of barrels
 that you can break. If you
 start out in the western end of
 the docks, and loot the two
 ships, you should find [MINI
 MEDAL #3], [15 COINS], [SEED OF
 STRENGTH], [ANTIDOTAL HERB],
 [BOXER SHORTS], [MINI MEDAL #4]
 and [7 COINS]. Make sure to
 talk to everyone at the docks
 while getting these items, and
 you'll find out that Torneko is
 planning to buy one of the
 ships. Interesting -- move back
 to the town itself. In the
 northeastern end, outside of
 the small house, you'll find
 [MINI MEDAL #5] in a barrel.
 The house in the southern end,
 where a nun lives, keeps a set
 of [WAYFARER'S CLOTHES] in a
 drawer, so get that. You have
 all the items hidden in town
 now, so save your game at the
 church and head east from town
 to find a tall, tall
 Lighthouse. If you want to play
 more, go inside it.

--- STRUGGLE IN THE LIGHTHOUSE -

 o------------------------------

 From the Lighthouse entrance,
 move to the northern part of
 the room, then go a tiny bit
 southwest to find a chest with
 a [SEED OF RESILIENCE], and
 another chest with [400 COINS]
 on your right hand. Head
 further north now to find
 Torneko standing near a
 stairway. He says he came here
 to put out the evil fire that's
 burning at the top of the
 Lighthouse, but now he wants
 you to take care of that for
 him. If that is fine with you
 (it is!) tell him you'll do it.
 Watch Torneko leave now, and
 head upstairs. Just left of
 where you start out that this
 floor, there is a chest, and
 inside it you'll find [MINI
 MEDAL #6].

 There's another chest on this
 floor too -- just follow the
 path that begins in the
 southeastern end of the room to
 find a [SEED OF STRENGTH]. Once
 you have it, use the stairs
 just west of where you got the
 seed. Up we go! You'll find a
 chest with some [HOLY WATER] up
 here, but nothing more. Head
 downstairs again, and this
 time, head up the stairs in the
 middle of the room. At the
 beginning of the next floor,
 there's not any floor on your
 east, south and north sides
 (kind of like a backwards C of
 no floor), so move a bit west
 so that you don't fall down,
 then make your way east to find
 a small demon.

 Talk to it to find out that he
 wants to take down Torneko --
 he has no interest in the Hero,
 Hoffman and the Sisters. Watch
 the demon crash into the
 ceiling when he tries to get
 out of here, then move north of
 the demon. There's a chest here
 with a [MOONWORT BULB], and
 another one containing a
 [HUNTER'S BOW]. Now head
 upstairs using the stairway
 near the two chests. We're soon
 at the top, but not just yet.
 Head straight south to find the
 [HOLY EMBERS], then proceed up
 the stairs northeast of the
 chest.

 The room you're in now is kind
 of weird, as there's a group of
 monsters dancing around some
 kind of fire here. Ignore them
 for a second, and move
 northwest to get a [GOLDEN
 TIARA] from a chest. Let Meena
 equip it to boost her defence
 by quite a bit. Now make sure
 your characters are fully
 healed, then attack the dancing
 monsters. Clobbering time!

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Dancing Group
 'o Monsters | DROPS: --- |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Maya, Meena,
 Hoffman |
 | MY LEVEL: 13                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Medium+          
 |                              
 | - You're up against two
 Flamethrower enemies, and a
 Tigergram. The | | tiger has a
 nasty screaming attack that can
 freeze you characters, | | so
 use Meena's "Snooze" ability to
 put it to sleep. Now
 concentrate | | on taking out
 those two Flamethrowers. Since
 the Tiger is asleep | | (Snooze
 at him again if he wakes up),
 just use normal attacks to | |
 kill them off. You're probably
 going to need to heal a couple
 of | | times, which shouldn't
 be a problem since both Hero
 and Meena have | | lovely
 healing spells by now. |
 |                              
 | Once the Flamethrowers are
 dead, cast "Sap" on the Tiger
 to lower | | its DEF, then take
 it down using normal attacks. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Remember that item you found
 downstairs? The Holy Embers?
 Stand close to the flame that
 the monsters were dancing
 around, and use that item. The
 evil flame vanishes, and a nice
 normal flame takes its place.
 Phew, that's nice. You've done
 what you came to the Lighthouse
 to do, so head back to
 Porthtrunnel. Torneko is
 waiting for you at the dock
 entrance, and looks quite happy
 about something. That something
 is the fact that he's finally
 bought a ship! He needs travel
 mates though, and asks for your
 party to join him. Agree to
 that, and team up with the big,
 round salesman. Oh, and Mary
 Lou gets to come on the ship
 too. Horses are always fun to
 bring on grand adventures.
 Anyway, since you have
 {TORNEKO'S SHIP} ship now, you
 can travel pretty much anywhere
 on the whole map. Torneko has
 made a plan though. The plan is
 to... Sail south ;D

 Torneko is a wise man, so
 listen to his advice and sail
 south. When you hit land, step
 out of the ship, and put
 Torneko in your battle lineup,
 instead of Hoffman. You do that
 in the "Misc." menu. Once done,
 walk a short distance east.
 There's a small village for you
 to visit here. It's named
 Mintos, and is neither too big
 or too small.

--- MINTOS ---------------------

 o------------------------------

 Upon arriving in Mintos,
 Hoffman decides to leave the
 party, and chase after his own
 dreams instead. He lets you
 keep Mary Lou, though, so
 that's OK. Can you see the inn
 near the village entrance?
 Behind it you will find some
 barrels, and inside one of them
 there is a [MOONWORT BULB].
 Take it, then head upstairs
 inside the inn. Read the book
 in the bookshelf (it speaks of
 a magic staff hidden in a cave
 somewhere), then break the pots
 near the bookshelf to get a
 [SEED OF WISDOM]. This one will
 boost your MP when eaten. Just
 south of the bookshelf, you'll
 see two men in a room. It's
 Alena's two servants! Speak
 with Borya to find out that
 Kiryl has gotten very sick, and
 needs help from Princess Alena.
 When he asks you to, tell him
 you'll search for her. Borya
 joins the party now, to help
 search for his master girl.

 Get out of the inn, and check
 the barrels in the absolute
 southeastern part of town.
 You'll get [MINI MEDAL #7] and
 a [SEED OF LUCK]. Go inside the
 eastmost house to find a [SCALE
 SHIELD] that you can equip,
 then jump into the well! Down
 here you'll see something
 shining on the ground. It's
 [MINI MEDAL #8]!

 Talk to the old man giving
 lectures at the stand in the
 middle of the village now. It
 has to be daytime for him to be
 there. Answer "No" to his first
 question, then tell him you
 want to take a bash at a test
 he has for you. The Hero says
 nothing when the old man asks
 her/him what the most important
 thing about business is. The
 old man is happy with that,
 because SILENCE IS GOLDEN.. The
 man now gives you a [TREASURE
 MAP]. If you "Use" this map,
 you'll see a big mark on the
 world map. There's a great
 treasure at this spot, but you
 can't get it just yet. I will
 tell you about it later, once
 you can reach that place.
 There's a [SEED OF RESILIENCE]
 in the barrels outside of a
 house just south of the man
 with the map, so pick that up
 if you want to. Now, then,
 before leaving Mintos, let's
 shop!

 As always, you are free to get
 whatever you want to get when
 shopping, but I have some
 suggestions for you! Get [IRON
 HELMS] and [CAUTERY SWORDS] for
 both the hero and Torneko, then
 get an [IRON APRON] only for
 Torneko. For Meena and Maya
 respectively, get an [IRON
 SHIELD] and a [GOLDEN TIARA].
 If you can't seem to afford all
 this goodness, you could always
 head out to the world map and
 kill baddies. I promise you
 that they drop lotsa gold. When
 you're done getting equipment
 from the shops, you are fit for
 leaving Mintos. As you may
 remember, Kiryl is sick and
 needs your help. We're going to
 try and search for something
 that can cure his sickness. So,
 save your progress and leave
 the village. Your next stop is
 the forest shrine east of
 Mintos.

 - FOREST SHRINE / PARTHENIA -

 As you can see, there are two
 big vortexes in the northern
 part of the shrine, but you
 can't reach them because of
 some locked gates. That's ok;
 instead, hug the western wall
 of the shrine, and walk north.
 You'll find a hole in the
 shrine's northern wall. Head
 into that hole to find [MINI
 MEDAL #9]. That's everything we
 can do here right now, so make
 your way south from the shrine
 to find a place called
 Parthenia.

 Speak with the old man south of
 the entrance. He says that he's
 seen Alena recently. Head to
 the eastern part of the area
 and speak with the King on one
 of the ackers. He says that he
 knows of a seed that can cure
 Kiryl's sickness, but it's
 hidden in a cave south of town.
 Break the bottle right of the
 king for a [SEED OF
 RESILIENCE], then head into the
 throne room for [3 COINS]. Save
 your game at the entrance, then
 leave Parthenia and go south.
 Enter the cave.

--- ICY CAVE -------------------

 o-----------------------------o
 You'll spot Alena and three men
 at the cave | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 entrance, but they don't see
 you and move | | deeper into
 the cave. Follow them for a |
 Seed of Agility.......[ ] |
 bit, then stop when you see a
 chest. There | Seed of
 Life..........[ ] | are some
 arrow pads on the ground. When
 | Robe of Serinity......[ ] |
 touching an arrow pad, you'll
 float in the | 800
 Coins.............[ ] |
 direction of the arrow, without
 being able | Feverfew
 Seed.........[ ] | to move in
 any other direction. | Feverfew
 Root.........[ ] | | Mini Medal
 #10........[ ] | Step on the
 arrows pointing left to get to
 | Moonwort Bulb.........[ ] |
 the chest. It contains a [SEED
 OF AGILITY] | Gold
 Bracer...........[ ] | Now go
 downstairs. You'll see Alena
 and her | Mini Medal
 #11........[ ] | group walking
 around searching for the seed |
 | that can cure Kiryl, but they
 don't seem to o
 -----------------------------o
 want anything to do with you
 right now.
        Bummer. Head onto the
        arrow pads in the
 very left end of the room.
 You'll float north, and stop
 near a chest that contains
 another [SEED OF LIFE] that you
 can feed to the hero. I know I
 did.

 Step on the arrows pointing
 east from here. You'll float
 past a chest, but don't worry,
 since we'll get it now. After
 getting off the arrows again,
 head west to find some arrows
 pointing north. Ignore the
 arrows for now, and head west
 for a chest with a [ROBE OF
 SERENITY] for Maya inside. Now
 head back to the arrows you
 ignored, and step on them.
 They'll lead you back to the
 chest you passed earlier. It
 contains [800 COINS]! Good for
 you!

 Make your way east from the 800
 Coins chest. You'll find two
 rows of arrow pads, both of
 them point south. Step on the
 westmost of those two pad rows
 in order to reach a stairway
 between two pillars in the
 absolute eastern part of the
 room. You won't be able to
 reach the stairway if you don't
 step on the westmost of the two
 arrow pad rows. Anyway, head
 downstairs to find a room with
 LOTS of arrow pads, and a chest
 in the middle of them.

 o------------------- TONS OF
 ARROW PADS, TONS OF THEM!
 ---------------------o
 |                              
 | - Step on the arrows in the
 upper right end of the room. |
 |                              
 | - Walk left, and step on the
 arrow pad that is third from
 the left end. | | The arrow on
 this pad points downwards.
 There is a Cannibox enemy chest
 | | in front of you now, so
 kill it off. |

 | - Above the Cannibox there is
 a hole in the ground. There are
 two arrow | | pads just north
 of this hole. Step on the one
 second from the bottom. | | It
 will take you to the chest
 placed in the middle of all the
 pads. | | Open the chest to get
 the [FEVERFEW SEED]. Take it
 back to Parthenia. |
 |                              
 o------------------------------

 Show the Fewerfew Seed to the
 king. He's still mowing dirt in
 the eastern part of town. Once
 he gets them, he puts the seeds
 into the dirt. The seed grows
 quickly, and before anyone
 really knows what happened,
 they've turned into plants. The
 king gives you one of them, a
 [FEVERFEW ROOT] that you can
 use to cure Kiryl's sickness.
 Head back to Mintos where he's
 lying.

 - MINTOS / RIVERTON -

 Visit the inn to see that
 Hoffman has already advanced in
 ranks, and been made chief of
 the inn. Nice for him, yes?
 Head upstairs own, where you'll
 meet Alena, who's caring for
 her servant Kiryl. Use the
 Fewerfew Root while standing
 close to Kiryl. Doing so will
 cure him of that nasty sickness
 he has. Kiryl and Alena will
 join your party now, so if you
 want to, put them in your
 battle lineup. As for myself,
 I'm going to switch Maya out
 for Alena, because I prefer
 characters that deal much
 damage when fighting. You can
 do as you wish, but now you
 know what's going on in the
 head of this guide's author :)

 Anyway, before you head out of
 the inn, a bard will stop you,
 saying that Ragnar McRyan is
 looking for you! Supposedly,
 Ragnar is hanging around
 somewhere in the western part
 of the Dragon Quest IV World.
 Interesting! Before searching
 for Ragnar, take a look at your
 world map. See that island in
 the very southern end? Sail
 there -- to Riverton Town!

 There's a small holm in the
 middle of Riverton Town, with a
 barrel on. Break it to get
 [MINI MEDAL #10]. Now break the
 barrels outside of the inn for
 a [MOONWORT BULB]. North of the
 inn, there's a hut with a [GOLD
 BRACER] inside. Enter the
 southmost hut now, and talk to
 the man there. He says he can
 make you a flying machine, if
 you just bring him the proper
 gas. Sounds nice, but we have
 no gas as of now. Break the
 barrels in his house to get the
 [MINI MEDAL #11] item. That
 would be all we can do in
 Riverton right now, so sail
 back to the world map, and
 travel to the western
 continent. Visit the palace in
 the southeastern end of that
 continent -- this is the place
 where the two sisters were
 defeated at the end of Chapter
 IV, Palais de Léon.

--- SEARCHING FOR THE MAGIC KEY 
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa507]---

 - PALAIS DE LÉON -             
| ITEM CHECKLIST              |
 Talk to Healie who is waiting
 outside of | | the palace to
 find out that Ragnar has been |
 Cloak of Evasion......[ ] |
 trapped inside, just like the
 old man who | Iron
 Mask.............[ ] | helped
 the sisters' escape from here
 at the | Full Plate
 Armor......[ ] | end of their
 chapter. You know, the REAL |
 Mini Medal #12........[ ] |
 king. Enough about that. Listen
 to Healie | Seed of
 Resilience....[ ] | now,
 because he says that someone in
 Aubout | Magic
 Key.............[ ] | du Monde
 might know something about a
 magic | | key that can be used
 to open the palace o
 -----------------------------o
 gates. It's a rumour he's
 heard. Take that information
 with you on your travels, and
 head south from the palace.

 You'll notice that the enemy
 population has gotten stronger
 on the world map, but
 everything else is the same.
 Albout du Monde in the first
 village south of Palais de
 Léon, and as you might
 remember, it's also Meena and
 Maya's home village. Make sure
 to enter during daytime, will
 you?

 - AUBOUT DU MONDE -

 Sleep at the inn if you need
 to; it's free -- then talk to
 the merchant staying at the
 inn. He usually hangs around at
 the Desert Bazaar, but now he's
 here. If you've got Maya, Borya
 or Alena in your battle lineup,
 you MUST get a [CLOAK OF
 EVASION], since it boosts their
 DEF by quite a lot. Also get a
 sexy [IRON MASK] and [FULL
 PLATE ARMOR] for the hero. Sell
 any other junk you're carrying
 to the merchant, and get out of
 the inn. Now, if you talk to
 all the villagers, you'll hear
 rumours about a slime living in
 the village. That's really
 weird -- some slimes are evil,
 some are nice and live in
 villages.

 This friendly slime actually
 lives in Meena and Maya's
 daddy's basement. Head down
 there and see for yourself.
 Talk to the little fellow to
 find out that there is a secret
 laboratory west of the village,
 which once belonged to Meena
 and Maya's pops. The magic key
 that can be used to open Palais
 de Léon and free Ragnar McRyan
 is supposed to be hidden
 somewhere in that lab. That's
 some real juicy information we
 got there. Thank you Slime
 monster friend! ^^

 - WESTERN CAVE -

 Travel west from Aubout de
 Monde to find the same cave you
 went to when Oojam joined Meena
 and Maya's party earlier in the
 game. Yup, that's right, the
 secret lab is hidden somewhere
 inside this cave! Actually, to
 find the entrance you have to
 examine the back of the chest
 in the room that Oojam was
 found in earlier. The chest
 used to contain the Night
 Light. Press the switch on the
 back of the chest to make a
 stairway appear on your left
 side. Head down there to find
 the secret lab.

 There's all kinds of weird
 stuff down here. For example,
 the fourth chapter in the
 Magical Staff book series can
 be read here, there's a bottle
 with the one and only [MINI
 MEDAL #12], a [SEED OF
 RESILIENCE]. And finally, the
 best thing in the lab is of
 course the [MAGIC KEY], who's
 kept in a chest that's not
 hidden at all. Just open the
 chest and take they key. You
 can use this key to open all of
 the red doors that are found at
 various places in the world. In
 the next section, I'll cover
 the locations of these red
 doors, along with the blue
 doors that can be opened by
 using the Thief's Key, which
 Alena has already got from her
 own chapter. If you're not
 interested in optional stuff
 however, you can skip out on
 the next section entirely.

--- OPTIONAL: RED & BLUE DOORS -
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa508]---

 - TREASURES IN ENDOR -         
| ITEM CHECKLIST              |
 Head inside the castle of Endor
 during | | night. Sneak up to
 the throne-room, then go |
 Fishnet Stockings.....[ ] |
 upstairs from there to find the
 King's | Pink
 Leotard..........[ ] |
 chambers. It's locked by a red
 door that | Mini Medal
 #13........[ ] | can be opened
 with your Magic Key. The |
 Feathered Cap.........[ ] |
 treasures inside are a set of
 black | Mini Medal #14........[
 ] | [FISHNET STOCKINGS] and a
 [PINK LEOTARD] | Seed of
 Strength......[ ] | for Alena,
 [MINI MEDAL #13] and a hot |
 Double-Edged Sword....[ ] |
 [FEATHERED CAP]. That's a total
 of four | Seed of
 Life..........[ ] | treasures.
 I've got to say though, that
 the | Mini Medal #15........[ ]
 | King of Endor has a rather
 creepy clothing | Iron
 Helm.............[ ] | taste. I
 mean, imagine him dressing up
 with | 750 Gold..............[
 ] | this kind of equipment.
 Almost disturbing. | Seed of
 Strength......[ ] |
|  Seed of Agility.......[  ] |
 Now, head out to the three
 castle gates, | Mini Medal
 52.........[ ] | and open the
 eastmost one. Walk north | Mini
 Medal 53.........[ ] | through
 the corridor, and you'll find a
 red | | door on your left side.
 o-----------------------------o

 Head into that door, and go
 down the stairway in here.
 After passing some poison on
 the ground, you'll find a
 secret room containing 3
 treasures: [MINI MEDAL #14],
 [SEED OF STRENGTH] and a
 [DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD] that will
 damage the character that uses
 it in battle. This secret room
 is actually located in the
 secret shop in the southeastern
 end of Endor town, but the only
 way to access it is by sneaking
 in from the castle, just like
 you did now. By accessing the
 main entrance to this shop in
 Endor town, you can buy some of
 the best armor pieces in the
 game, if you're interested.

 - PRISONBOUND MINI MEDALS -

 There's one mini medal waiting
 for you in the prison of
 Strathbaile, but you can only
 get it if you've got the
 Ultimate Key. It's locked up
 behind one of those sturdy
 doors, after all. Because I
 forgot about this medal when I
 originally wrote this section,
 I had to refer to it as [MINI
 MEDAL #52]. There is another
 medal, [MINI MEDAL #53] waiting
 for you in the Ballymoral
 Prison. You'll find it in a
 barrel in one of the
 southwestern cells.

 - TREASURES IN BURLAND -

 Inside the castle in Burland
 (Ragnar's starting point),
 there is a treasury locked with
 a blue door. It's on your left
 side after entering the castle.
 Make sure to heal all your
 characters before going in
 there, since you will lose some
 HP when walking on the treasury
 floor. Head in there to find
 six chests. Inside them you'll
 find a [SEED OF LIFE], [MINI
 MEDAL #15], [IRON HELM], [750
 GOLD], [SEED OF STRENGTH], and
 finally a [SEED OF AGILITY].
 Feed the seeds to your hero,
 and sell the helmet. By now
 your equipment should be
 stronger than it, after all.
 That would be all the treasures
 you can get by using your two
 keys at this point, so let's
 continue with the main
 storyline now. Make sure to
 heal and save first though!

--- TEAMING UP WITH RAGNAR -----

 o------------------------------

 Before continuing, make sure
 that the characters in your
 battle lineup are around Level
 20. We're going to be part of a
 pretty tough battle soon, and I
 really recommend using Meena as
 one of the members in your
 lineup, since you're going to
 want her "Zing" spell, which
 can resurrect fallen friends
 during battle. Meena learns
 Zing at Level 20. Once you're
 ready, please continue
 reading/playing! With the Magic
 Key in your inventory, make
 your way back to the castle
 where Ragnar is trapped. Open
 the rightmost castle gate, and
 head to the northern end of the
 first floor. Ragnar is here,
 trying to get that secret
 passage open. Break the door
 open, and follow him into the
 King's chamber. Ragnar starts
 fighting the king's soldiers,
 so be quick and talk to the
 king to start fighting. Like
 last time, he turns into a blue
 lion when you approach him.

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Marquis de
 Leon | DROPS: [FULL PLATE
 ARMOR] |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Torneko, Meena,
 Alena |
 | MY LEVEL: 20                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Medium+          
 |                              
 | - The key to this battle is
 to have characters that aren't
 underleveled. | | The boss has
 a crapload of HP, and you're
 going to have to do lots of | |
 damage to him to take him down.
 Let Meena be your main healer
 during | | the whole battle.
 Let her heal someone every
 single turn -- the | | party
 member with the smallest amount
 of HP should ALWAYS receive | |
 healing from her. The boss
 attacks two times each turn,
 which means | | that a party
 member could go from having
 lots of HP to having close | |
 to nothing at the beginning of
 next turn. |
 |                              
 | As for the other party
 members, simply attack the boss
 using normal | | attacks. No
 magic spells are needed. When
 the boss uses his Ice | |
 Breath attack, all of your
 characters will take damage,
 and in that | | kind of
 situation, you might want to
 use your hero to heal too, in |
 | addition to Meena. But do
 note, the hero's main role
 should be to | | focus on using
 normal attacks, not healing
 others. |
 |                              
 | It's not a quick battle, but
 Meena should be able to keep
 your party | | up and kicking
 from beginning 'til end. If
 someone dies, just | |
 resurrect them using her "Zing"
 spell. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 After being defeated, the boss
 realizes that the hero is
 indeed the person that is
 destined to defeat the lord of
 the Underworld. And he's right
 about that, because you are
 going to win this game! I think
 you are, at least. Everyone in
 the castle suddenly start
 wondering what they've been
 doing up 'til now.. It seems
 like they've been under some
 kind of mind spell or
 something. The soldiers and
 servants weren't REALLY evil
 after all. Not even the King --
 he's a nice guy too. Just talk
 to him and you'll see.

 Speak to Ragnar once you're
 ready, and he'll join your
 party. Before leaving the
 castle, speak with the
 Chancellor to find out that
 Balzack has taken residence in
 Zamoksva Castle. That
 information should come in
 handy later on. Oh, and by the
 way, you have all the party
 members you can possibly get in
 this game now. So, before you
 continue with the main
 storyline, make sure to give
 him proper equipment (full
 plate armor + the strength ring
 that you can get from the Mini
 Medal King is recommended!),
 then grind around a bit until
 Ragnar's level is close to the
 other party members. Also
 remember to save your game,
 then head over to Zamoksva
 Castle, where Alena used to
 live before.

 - ZAMOKSVA CASTLE -

 It's just east of Zalenagrad,
 if you feel a wee bit lost.
 Once you reach the Castle,
 you'll sense that something is
 wrong... it has been..
 DEMONIZED! I mean, the castle
 has been taken over by baddies!
 We have to put an end to that,
 so head upstairs to the throne
 room, and talk to the King. Of
 course, it's not the real king
 -- it's Balzack in disguise!
 Yiiikes!

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Balzack |
 DROPS: --- |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Alena, Ragnar,
 Meena |
 | MY LEVEL: 21                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Hard             
 |                              
 | - Without any doubt, this is
 the hardest battle this far!
 It's very | | similar to the
 last boss battle you fought in,
 but Balzack is more | |
 powerful. He attacks twice per
 turn, using normal attacks that
 hit | | once of your party
 members, or magic attacks that
 will hit all of | | them! To
 avoid taking damage from those
 magic attacks, you could | |
 cast Meena's spell to
 neutralize magic, but doing so
 will make your | | characters
 resistant to friendly healing
 spells as well, so avoid |
 |    doing that.               
 |                              
 | A nice but slow way of
 getting through the battle is
 to use Meena's | | midheal
 spell every single turn, and
 then let the Hero use the same
 | | spell when even more
 healing than Meena can produce
 is needed. That | | will most
 likely be very often. So, use
 Meena as your main healer, | |
 and let the Hero help her
 whenever needed. When the
 hero's healing | | isn't
 needed, let him/her join the
 others in attacking Balzack
 with |
 |    normal attacks.           
 |                              
 | If your characters are the
 same as mine were, they are
 likely to die | | a couple of
 times before you win. When that
 happens, revive them | | using
 Meena's "Zing" spell, and use
 the Hero's midheal to take care
 | | of the others, keeping them
 alive. You're going to need a
 little | | luck to pull all
 this off without being
 defeated, but who has ever | |
 died of trying the same thing
 three times? I didn't, for
 sure! Kinda! |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Now that Balzack is dead, you
 can head downstairs and walk
 into the castle's treasure
 which was blocked by a flame
 earlier. Inside you'll find the
 [FLUTE OF REVELATION], a [SEED
 OF STRENGTH] and the [MAGMA
 STAFF]. Let Meena equip the
 staff if you have her in your
 party, and feed the seed to
 your Hero.

 Now, let's trigger the next
 event, o-------- OPTIONAL MEDAL
 ---------o shall we? Travel to
 Strathbaile Town, | | which is
 located north of Burland | -
 Before going to Femiscyra, |
 Castle. When you sleep at the
 inn in | you can sail over to
 the tiny | Strathbaile, you'll
 see a weird dream | island
 directly north of | related to
 the Flute of Revelation |
 Palais de Léon. There is a |
 that you found in Zamoksva
 Castle. The | old man's hut on
 the island, | dream shows you
 exactly where it is | and
 inside you'll find | you need
 to use the flute. It's near |
 [MINI MEDAL #16]. | some kind
 of tower, with a red-haired | |
 person standing inside. We'll
 worry o------------------------
 ---------o about that later
 though; right now we're going
 to go to a place called
 Femiscyra. It's a rather weird
 place.

 o------------------------------

 To get there, use your "Zoom"
 ability to teleport over to
 Burland. Go to the river just
 north of Burland, and sail east
 from there to find a huge
 mountain chain. Walk south
 along the mountain chain to
 find something that looks like
 a brown pile on the world map.
 Enter this place. There's a
 blockade in here, but you can
 remove it by using your Magma
 Staff. Doing so will reveal a
 secret passage to Femiscyra, a
 kingdom where only females are
 allowed! Before entering, make
 sure to pick the Magma Staff
 back up from the ground! Losing
 it over something like this
 would have been mega-stupid,
 wouldn't it? Heck yes!

 Anyway, there are some nice-
 looking guards outside the
 castle, saying that only women
 are allowed to live inside the
 castle. You can visit though,
 so head inside. Go left from
 the entrance to find a pile of
 bottles. Break them all to get
 [MINI MEDAL #17]. Alright, now
 visit the small room in the
 eastern part of the room, where
 a bard is looking through the
 drawers. Talk to him to make
 him leave, then grab a [SEED OF
 WISDOM] from inside of the
 drawer. When you try to leave
 the room however, a nun comes
 up to you, saying that you've
 stole her bronze rosary! God,
 the bard! It was the
 baaaaaard!! He stole it! A
 guard hears all the quarrel,
 and arrests your party. Follow
 her down into the prison
 cellar, and wait for the Queen
 of Femiscyra to appear.

 First tell the queen "NO" when
 she asks o----- SECRET CASTLE
 CELLAR ------o if you stole the
 bronze rosary, then | | tell
 her "YES" when she asks if
 you're | - Before leaving the
 castle, | innocent (do the
 math!). The Queen says | look

 prove | leads up to the throne
 room. | you're innocent, but
 requires that one | There's a

 that leads down to a super |
 the prison. Let someone that

 That's where | of your lineup
 stay behind. Head up to |
 you'll find a GREAT weapon |
 the Queen's throne room once
 you're | for Alena: The [FIRE
 CLAW]! | free, and open the
 blue door there. | | Examine
 the drawer in here for a tight
 o------------------------------
 ---o [LEATHER DRESS] and
 another tasty [SEED OF
 AGILITY]. Now go downstairs
 again, as we're soon going to
 start looking for that mean,
 mean thief that set us up
 earlier. But first you should
 really get Alena's Fire Claws,
 which are hidden in the castle,
 and mentioned in that small
 square right of this paragraph.
 Once you have it, leave.

 Start looking in the cave just
 southeast of Femiscyra Castle,
 ok? Go there :) Oh, and make
 sure to put Kiryl in your
 battle lineup before entering
 the cave. He doesn't need good
 equipment or anything -- just
 put him in your lineup!

 - FEMISCYRA CAVE -

 There's a quite a lot of sand
 down here. Dirty place indeed.
 Me and you, we aren't dirty
 though, so we're going to have
 to do this quickly. There are
 several chests down here too.
 To get the first one, head
 south from the very beginning
 and follow the path until you
 see it. It contains [MINI MEDAL
 #18]. Now follow the path in
 the northwestern end of the
 area, and take the first fork
 south for another chest with a
 [SEED OF STRENGTH] inside. Now,
 do you see those small steps
 just below the chest, leading
 up a a slightly elevated path?
 Head up there and follow the
 elevated path east to another
 chest. There's a golden
 surprise inside: [1050 COINS]!
 Yay for rich donk-- players!
 You have all the items on this
 floor now, so head down to the
 southwestern end of the area to
 find a path leading to a
 stairway. It's time to head
 downstairs.

 Now that you've hit the lower
 floor, go a tiny bit southwest,
 and follow the path that leads
 south. You'll find a chest on a
 small hilltop, and inside
 there's a [SEED OF LUCK]. From
 this chest, go straight east,
 then south. You'll soon see an
 elevated path leading west.
 Walk up on that path, and
 follow it west. It will
 eventually lead to two new
 chests: one has a cool [DRAGON
 SHIELD] inside, while the other
 one has a cute, little [IRON
 MASK] for you. The shield is
 very useful, since it provides
 a lot of defense, and reduces
 elemental damage. Let either
 Ragnar or the Hero equip it.

 The same goes for the mask --
 let Ragnar or the Hero put it
 on. Now exit the room by
 heading back east from the two
 chests, and then moving
 southwest from there. Another
 stairway's waiting for you in
 the lower left end. Heal before
 going down there.

 Welcome to... the thief's
 hideout!! That meanie is
 sleeping on his bed down here,
 so take a look at his body to
 find that the bronze rosary is
 still hanging around his neck.
 When you try to take it
 however, the thief wakes up.
 And guess what.. he tries to
 escape too! Quickly run over to
 the room's only door and block
 his way. Now, show him who the
 boss is (that's... you)!

 stop the thief | | from using
 his magic spells. One of them
 can boost his DEF so much | |
 that he turns close to
 invincible, but you can stop
 that without | | having to go
 through too much hassle. Just
 use Kiryl's "Fizzle" spell | |
 to prevent all of your enemy's
 magic spells. Kiryl doesn't
 really | | have to be well-
 equipped or anything for this
 battle; his task is | | just to
 cast this spell, and nothing
 else. As for your other party |
 | members, just use normal
 attacks until you win the
 battle, and let | | Meena do
 the healing if you get low on

 '------------------------------

 One of the Queen's guards has
 been spying on you the whole
 time, and now she reveals
 herself, saying that the Queen
 asked her to help you in case
 of trouble. Then she takes the
 thief back to Femiscyra. It's
 strange though, she didn't
 really help us at all. Stupid
 girlie guard. Anyway, time to
 see what's inside all of his
 drawers and bottles in the
 thief's hideout: A [MERCURY'S
 BANDANA], [MINI MEDAL #19],
 [HOLY WATER], and a diary about
 the thief's exploits. Anyway,
 equip the Bandana on someone
 you want to have high agility.
 Alena is a wonderful choice --
 give it to her if you want to!
 To wrap your Cave Story up,
 head back to the world map, and
 travel to Femiscyra again.

 - BACK IN FEMISCYRA -

 The queen is waiting for your
 party in the throne room. Go
 see her to clear your name of
 what you've been accused for.
 The queen says that you're free
 to go now, and gives you the
 [ULTIMATE KEY], which can be
 used to open a LOT of different
 doors! One of those doors is
 the prison door in the castle's
 dungeon, where one of your
 party members are waiting for
 you. What's almost just as
 awesome as getting that key, is
 that the queen also gives you
 one of the biggest treasures in
 the whole game -- you just have
 to go and pick it up yourself.
 So, let's go get it right away
 -- the Zenithian Shield! Just
 go downstairs from the throne
 room, and look for the stairway
 in the upper right end of the
 castle's main floor. It leads
 down to the treasury, where a
 chest is stored behind a metal
 gate. Inside, the [ZENITHIAN
 SHIELD] can be found!

 Let the Hero equip this
 legendary shield, and make sure
 to remember that the Ultimate
 Key can open all metal gates
 that look like the one in this
 treasury. Well, ok, now let's
 free the party member you left
 in the castle prison after
 getting set up by the bard
 thief. Just head down the
 stairs in the upper left end of
 the castle's main floor to team
 up with that party member
 again.

 Now that you have the Ultimate
 Key, you're essentially able to
 open all of the locked doors
 and gates in the whole game.
 Let's use the key to get some
 goods now. These are all
 optional though, so you can
 skip this section if you wanna.
 Collecting stuff is good
 however and I really recommend
 doing this with me ^_^ Remember
 that you can use the "Zoom"
 spell to travel to places you
 have visited earlier in the
 game.

 - Casabranca: There is a
   treasury in the northwestern
   part of Casabranca Town.
   It's sealed off by two metal
   gates, but you can get
   through using the Ultimate
   Key, so there is no problem.
   Inside the treasury, you'll
   find chests containing
   delicious treasures: [350
   COINS], a [PRAYER RING] that
   will let the wearer
   regenerate MP, and finally
   the [MINI MEDAL #20].

 - PORTHRUNNEL: Go take a look
   inside the Porthrunnel inn.
   There's a locked
   metal gate there. Open it to
   get the [MASSACRE SWORD].
   This sword is cursed however,
   just like the ghost next to
   the chest will tell you. If
   you equip it, the user's
   defense will get drained by a
   great lot. I wouldn't equip
   it if I were you. But hey,
   it's a nice collectible item,
   after all.

 - HAVRE LÉON: In the eastern
   part of this town, there is a
   prison. It's inside
   that small, white building.
   Using the Ultimate Key, you
   can open all of the prison
   cells, and loot whatever's
   inside. If you're wondering,
   the goods inside the cells
   are as follows: [MINI MEDAL
   #21], [SEED OF STRENGTH] as
   well as a shiny little
   producer of happiness: [MINI
   MEDAL #22].

 - LAKANABA: Remember the shop
   at which Torneko was working
   in the beginning of
   his chapter? Head inside, and
   go down to the owner's
   cellar. There's a big
   treasury down there! It's
   probably everything that the
   shopkeeper owns, so I hope
   you won't feel too bad after
   robbing it all: [CHAIN
   SICKLE], [SEED OF STRENGTH]
   and a [ICICLE DIRK]. The
   icicle dirk is very powerful;
   consider letting the Hero
   equip it. As for the sickle,
   it's not a very good weapon
   -- sell it if you want to.

 - ROSEHILL VILLAGE: Zoom to
   Mintos, and sail east from
   there. Once you see the
   lighthouse, sail north up the
   river there to find Rosehill
   Village. Talk to everyone
   (and buy weapons/armor if you
   want to), then enter the
   tower in the western end. Go
   downstairs to find [MINI
   MEDAL #23] in a locker.

--- GETTING THE ZENITHIAN ARMOR 
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa512]---

 We already have the first piece
 of the o
 ----------------------------o
 Zenithian set of equipment --
 the shield -- | ITEM CHECKLIST
 | so now let's go and the the
 armor. If you | | sail over to
 the Mini Medal King's island |
 Mini Medal #24.......[ ] |
 (northeastern corner of world
 map), and look | Mini Medal
 #25.......[ ] | straight north
 from there, you'll see a |
 Zenithian Armor......[ ] |
 cave. Heal up at the Mini Medal
 King's inn, | Mini Medal
 #26.......[ ] | then head into
 that cave. You'll see that | |
 instead of walking, you'll be
 sailing on a o
 ----------------------------o
 raft in here, since there's
 water everywhere.

 Anyway, at the beginning, open
 the red gate, then sail east.
 When you see a chest on your
 right side, go and open it to
 get [MINI MEDAL #24]. Now hop
 back on your raft, and continue
 sailing a tiny bit north. Step
 onto land again when you see a
 passage on your left side. The
 passage leads to [MINI MEDAL
 #25]. Grab that medal, then go
 back to your raft once again.
 Hope you're not sick of it just
 yet!

 Continue sailing north, and
 then west when the current
 leads in that direction. Let
 yourself be guided by the water
 :). Once you see another
 passage, this time leading
 south into a new room, sail
 into it to reach the very
 center of the cave. Sail past
 all the cliffs in here, and
 make your way west to find
 another passage. Sail through
 it. The first thing you'll see
 in the next room, is a tiny,
 tiny holm with a stairway on
 it. Head down that stairway to
 proceed.

 And guess what! Down here, two
 huge chests are waiting for
 you. There's no one guarding
 them or anything either, so
 have at them! You'll get the
 [ZENITHIAN ARMOR] and [MINI
 MEDAL #26]. That's good -- you
 didn't have to fight too much
 for those items. Equip the
 armor on the Hero, then leave
 the cave. You're done here, and
 you did very well! The next
 section covers an optional
 sidequest that you can do in
 order to get one of the best
 swords in the game. If you
 don't really want that, you can
 skip the entire section, and
 continue reading the next one.

--- OPTIONAL: LIQUID METAL SWORD
    SIDEQUEST ------------------
    --------[wa513]---

 o-----------------------------o
 Now, let's do the only real
 sidequest in | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 Dragon Quest IV. Going through
 with it will | | reward you
 with one heck of a sword, so |
 Karstaway Stone.......[ ] |
 please read on! Sail over to
 the westmost | Mini Medal
 #27........[ ] | island on the
 world map. There's only one |
 Fishnet Stockings.....[ ] |
 town on this island, it's named
 | Leather Hat...........[ ] |
 "Dunplundrin". Enter town
 during night, and | Sands of
 Time.........[ ] | have a look
 at the ocean at the beach. |
 Mini Medal #28........[ ] |
 You'll see a circle in the
 water. It's | Death
 Mask............[ ] | flashing,
 and there's... no water there!
 | 780 Coins.............[ ] |
 Remember the exact location of
 this spot, | Liquid Metal
 Sword....[ ] | then sleep at
 the inn and wait for daytime. |
 | During day, walk to the spot
 you saw o
 -----------------------------o
 last night, and EXAMINE the
 ground there.

 You'll find the [KARSTAWAY
 STONE]. It'll come in handy
 later when we need to enter a
 certain dungeon. But right now,
 you should just keep it in your
 inventory. While still being in
 Dunplundrin, jump down into the
 town well to find [MINI MEDAL
 #27] and [FISHNET STOCKINGS],
 then enter the house in the
 northwestern part of the
 village for a brown, gooey and
 dusty [LEATHER HAT].

 - SIDEQUEST CAVE -

 Take a look at the world map.
 See that huge, red "X" in the
 southeastern end? Straight
 north (but quite far away) of
 that X, on the big, central-
 eastern continent, there is a
 small, red dot. That's a cave I
 haven't talked about in this
 walkthrough this far. Enter
 that cave, and head as far
 north as you can. You'll see a
 set of stairs leading down into
 the water. You can't walk
 through the water though, so
 you'll have to USE your
 Karstaway Stone -- the one you
 found in Dunplundrin Village.
 So, head down those stairs now,
 since the stone will suck up
 all the water that prevented
 you from entering earlier.

 In the next room there is a
 chest and a gate. The chest
 contains the unique [SANDS OF
 TIME], so take it, and go
 through the gate, then head
 down the stairs on the other
 side. You'll arrive in an area
 where you're walking on a path
 elevated above lots and lots of
 water. Go northwest from the
 beginning to find a chest with
 [MINI MEDAL #28] inside. Now
 walk northwest from this chest,
 and follow the path until you
 find another stairway leading
 downwards. Now, from the
 beginning of this floor, head
 straight south to find a chest.
 There's a rare [DEATH MASK]
 inside! Head back to the
 stairs, and head east this
 time.

 Go south the next time the path
 splits to find [780 COINS].
 Continue following the path
 east from the coin chest. When
 the path splits yet again, take
 the eastmost path, and you'll
 end up at a new stairway. Go
 down to the next floor. This is
 the lowest point of the
 dungeon, and there's no
 labyrinth or anything here --
 just a treasure chest on an
 altar. Open it to get one of
 the best weapons in the game:
 the super-hyper-mega-awesome
 [LIQUID METAL SWORD]! Let your
 Hero equip it, and wooh, you've
 got exactly what you came here
 for. In the next section, I'll
 continue covering the main game
 again -- we're going to go and
 get the Zenithian Helm!

--- CANALOT'S ZENITHIAN HELM ---
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa514]---

 To reach Canalot, you're going
 to have to o
 ----------------------------o
 sail to the very northwestern
 end of the | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 world map. There's an island
 there that | | looks like a
 spiral, and in the middle of |
 Somatic Staff........[ ] | that
 spiral, Canalot lies. To get
 there, get | Dream
 Blade..........[ ] | in land on
 the southeastern end of the |
 Mini Medal #29.......[ ] |
 spiral. From there, you can
 walk straight | Mini Medal
 #30.......[ ] | into Canalot.
 The place you need to step in |
 Seed of Strength.....[ ] | land
 at is right next to a small
 mountain, | Magic
 Water..........[ ] | if you're
 having trouble finding it. |
 Chiamera Wing........[ ] | |
 Mini Medal #31.......[ ] | Upon
 entering the city, you'll see
 that | Tom Foolery..........[ ]
 | there's a lot of water here,
 and you'll need | Zenithian
 Helm.......[ ] | to step on the
 raft north of the entrance | |
 if you want to get anywhere.
 So, step on the o
 ----------------------------o
 raft, and sail to the weapons
 shop in the upper left end of
 the pool. Buy a [SOMATIC STAFF]
 if you've got any staff users
 in your lineup, and let them
 equip it. Also, if you enter
 town during night, you can buy
 a [DREAM BLADE] for Ragnar, if
 he needs a stronger sword.

 Next, head for the well in the
 northeastern part of town. Next
 to it, there's a semi-hidden
 bottle. Crush it open to get
 [MINI MEDAL #29]. To get yet
 another medal, go inside the
 white house next to the well. A
 lady lives here, but she won't
 mind that you take [MINI MEDAL
 #30] from her drawer. At least
 that's what I think, since the
 lady looks kind of big.. and
 rich. That's all you can do in
 town, so sail through the
 northern town gates now. You'll
 reach the castle! It's a...
 water castle!

 You'll see an old man on your
 right side. Break the bottle
 next to him for a [SEED OF
 STRENGTH], then talk to him.
 Tell him you are here to answer
 to the King's appeal. Continue
 north now, to find three castle
 entrances. Head into the
 rightmost one. Continue north
 to find a room with four
 barrels/bottles. Break them to
 get a [MAGIC WATER] bottle, and
 examine the drawers in here for
 a [CHIMAERA WING] while you're
 at it. There are three
 additional drawers in the room
 left of here. One contains
 [MINI MEDAL #31]. Backtrack to
 the three castle entrances, and
 enter the one in the middle
 this time. Make sure it's
 daytime, as the king will only
 be waiting for you in his
 throne room then. So, make your
 way to the very top floor now.

 The king is having an audience,
 so wait for the ones he's
 talking with to leave, then
 approach his majesty. The king
 asks you to make a good joke,
 but none of your party members
 are able to. You'll have to
 come up with a good one
 somehow... but... how!? How
 should we do that!? I know.
 I'll tell you too. See, there
 is a man with a white hat and
 green sweater sitting one floor
 below the throne room. Speak to
 that man. He says that the
 great entertainer named Tom
 Foolery might be able to help
 you amuse the king. We're going
 to have to find him, and see if
 he knows any good jokes! The
 search begins!

 - FINDING MISTER FOOLERY /
   IMPRESSING THE KING OF
   CANALOT -

 Now, where do you think an
 entertainer would be hanging
 out? Think about it for a
 second, and you might get the
 right idea: He's at the theatre
 in Laissez Fayre, where Meena
 and Maya used to dance before.
 Use your Zoom spell to get
 there right away, and enter the
 theatre. [TOM FOOLERY] is the
 man with the red sweater and
 funny hair; speak with him to
 make him follow you. Head out
 to the world map again, and put
 Foolery in the front position
 of your lineup. You NEED to do
 this, or amusing the king won't
 work. Now Zoom all the way back
 to the castle in Canalot, and
 talk with the king again.

 Tom Foolery's quite the
 speaker, and manages to impress
 the king at his very first try.
 The king melts like a banana in
 the sun.. and... gives you the
 [ZENITHIAN HELM]! Wow, how's
 that for size!? Let your Hero
 equip it now! If you've given
 the whole thing about the
 Zenithian equipment set any
 thought, you might already have
 figured that there is only one
 part missing now.. Once you
 have the next piece, the
 Zenithian Sword, the set will
 be complete, and you'll be able
 to start eating away at the
 endgame. Sounds exciting? It is
 :) For some more of that
 excitement, we're going to
 explore a tomb next!

--- ROYAL CRYPT ----------------

 o------------------------------
 |

 |                              
 o------------------------------

 Quickest way to find the tomb
 is to Zoom over to Endor, and
 sail straight south down the
 river from there. You'll find a
 shrine, and inside this shrine,
 the Royal Crypt is. It's locked
 by a metal gate, but those
 haven't really been issues for
 a long time, since you have the
 Ultimate Key. So, get that gate
 open and head downstairs. Step
 on the arrow that leads up and
 northwest, and let it take you
 right over to another set of
 stairs. Head downstairs. Keep
 on following the arrows from
 here, until you find yourself
 near a chest between two
 statues. Open it up to get the
 [STAFF OF ANTIMAGIC]. That
 should make you happy. It does,
 I'm sure. Ignore the vortex
 right of the chest, and run
 left straight left instead.
 Follow the path, and you'll see
 another chest behind a wall.
 Just keep on following your
 path, and move towards that
 chest while hugging the wall.
 You don't want to get caught by
 the arrow pads on the floor.

 Inside the chest on the other
 side of the wall, you'll find
 another medal, this time it's
 [MINI MEDAL #32]. Sprint south
 from where you got the medal,
 and make your way to the stairs
 in the southeastern part of the
 area.

 Head upstairs. Move a tiny bit
 left, and o----- AFTER THE

 Anyway, Now, just ignore the
 yellow doors above you, and
 exit the Crypt by going east.
 We're done here now!

--- FAR SOUTH COLOSSUS ---------
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa516]---

 o----------------------------o
 Your next destination is near
 Riverton -- | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 in the southern end of the
 world map. With | | your ship,
 sail south out of Riverton. |
 Mini Medal #33.......[ ] |
 After doing so, you'll see a
 really weird | 640
 Coins............[ ] | building
 on the world map. It kind of
 looks | Seed of Agility......[
 ] | like a statue of a sad
 animal. Really weird | Hela's
 Hammer........[ ] | and crazy
 stuff. This is the Colossus. At
 | | least that's what the
 priest that lives o
 ----------------------------o
 next to it says. Open the metal
 gate that
        leads into the Colossus,
        and enter.
 The colossus is pretty huge
 though; the first room feels
 really big and empty, with
 nothing but some stairs and a
 chest north of them. Open the
 chest to get [MINI MEDAL #33],
 then go downstairs.

 Straight from the beginning of
 this floor, move southwest for
 [640 COINS], then head up the
 new stairway in the
 northeastern end of the room.
 Go up another set of stairs to
 find a room that's kind of like
 a labyrinth. It's not hard to
 get through though -- just
 rotate your camera to get a
 good overview. Make sure to
 pick up the chest in the
 central east end of the
 labyrinth if you want a [SEED
 OF AGILITY]. Now head up the
 stairs in the southwestern part
 of the "labyrinth". Ignore the
 two black doors on the next
 floor, and go up the stairs
 right of them instead. You'll
 now find yourself in a new
 "labyrinth".

 So, in this labyrinth there is
 a door directly south of the
 stairs you came up from. It
 leads out to the Colossus's
 hands. Head out there to find a
 chest with [HELA'S HAMMER]
 inside. It's a strange weapon
 though -- it misses your target
 very often, but is very
 powerful WHEN it happens to
 hit. Anyway, head back inside
 the Colossus, and go one floor
 downstairs again, so that
 you're at the floor with those
 two black doors you ignored
 earlier. If you rotate your
 camera, you'll find a hidden
 door northeast of the ones you
 ignored. Head into that hidden
 door, then go up the stairs in
 there.

 See the treasure chest on your
 right, next to some stairs?
 It's a mimic monster. Kill it
 if you want to, then go up the
 stairs. Now, up here, there are
 two doors leading south. Head
 out the westmost door (I tried
 the other one first, and I fell
 down to a bad place.. it made
 me cry T___T) to fall down onto
 the Colossus's left hand. While
 standing on his left hand, go
 inside again. You'll find more
 stairs in there -- keep walking
 up the stairs 'til you reach
 the very top floor! There's a
 golden lever up here -- try
 pulling it ^_^

 As if you just activated a
 magic force, the giant Colossus
 starts walking! And you're
 riding him! God, this is fun!
 Watch the cut-scene, and enjoy
 being taken to the other side
 of a river. When you're back in
 control, jump out of the
 opening in the eastern part of
 the room with the golden lever.
 It's kind of corny -- you'll be
 jumping out of the Colossus's
 ear! And land on the southern
 side of a river on the world
 map. The reason why you climbed
 the Colossus was, after all, to
 get to the other side of that
 river. And now, now you've done
 it! Not bad at all, dear
 reader! From now on, whenever
 you want to get past that
 river, you can just use the
 vortex that has appeared near
 the Colossus's location. But
 right now, head east from that
 river you just passed. You'll
 see a dark palace just ahead,
 this is Diabolic Hall, where
 baddies
live!

--- DIABOLIC HALL, WHERE THE
    BADDIES LIVE! --------------
    ------------[wa517]---

 Before entering the hall, use
 your Mod Rod o

 castle, head down | | the
 stairs on your left hand. There
 are o
 ----------------------------o
 several chests, bottles and
 prison gates down here, so
 break them all. And, make sure
 to talk to the prisoners. They
 all seem to have eating
 disorders -- anorexia!

 The chests and bottles contain
 [MINI MEDAL #34], [PRAYER RING]
 and a nice [LUCIDA SHARD]. Now
 head down the stairs south of
 the prison cells. Head through
 a short corridor, then go
 upstairs two times. You'll get
 to spy on two monsters having a
 conversation. They're talking
 about betraying Psaro, the
 baddest of all baddies. Good to
 know! Now, go all the way back
 to the very beginning of the
 palace. This time, head up the
 huge stairway in the
 northeastern end of that room.
 You'll reach the throne room,
 but it's kind of empty. Left of
 the throne there are some
 stairs. Head down them to
 arrive outside, behind the
 castle itself. Outside, on your
 left hand, there's another
 stairway leading downwards to a
 secret room with lots of gates
 in. Open all the chests in that
 room to get [SEED OF
 RESILIENCE], the [TEMPEST
 SHIELD] and [MINI MEDAL #35].
 One of the chests is a mimic,
 so there's only three items
 down here. After taking them
 all, head back to the throne
 room again. This time, head
 through the door southwest of
 the throne.

 Jump down from the balcony. Now
 use Maya's "Safe Passage" spell
 to avoid taking damage when
 walking on the electrified
 ground. In the very eastern end
 of the screen, you'll find some
 stairs leading down into the
 ground. There's a tombstone
 down here, and something
 shining on the ground next to
 it. Pick it up -- it's a
 [KAMIKAZE BRACER]! Let one of
 your party members equip it,
 then just head back to the
 throne room again. Enter the
 door southwest of the throne
 again, but instead of jumping
 down from the balcony, enter
 the door on your left hand
 instead. Welcome to the
 monsters' audience room! Turn
 yourself into a monster using
 the Mod Rod now, and make sure
 to talk to ALL of the scary
 monsters in here. The monsters
 are:

 - Small Devil
 - Blue Tiger
 - Skeleton
 - Green Flame
 - Rhino

 When you've spoken to them all,
 walk over to the chair just
 south of the Blue Tiger, and
 wait for a cut-scene to
 trigger. Apparently, Psaro is
 on his way here -- to talk with
 the other monsters. Wow, that's
 awesome. When Psaro arrives, he
 explains that a group of humans
 have reawakened Estark, Lord of
 the Underworld, while they were
 mining in Mamon Mine! Not good
 for them, but for me and you,
 it means... a longer game
 experience. Psaro commands all
 of the monsters to follow him
 to Mamon Mine and check up on
 the dark lord. And with that,
 we've got nothing more to do in
 Diabolic Hall. Head and save
 your game now, then travel to
 Mamon Mine. You'll find it west
 of Havre Léon.

--- BACK TO MAMON MINE! ESTARK
    MUST BE STOPPED! -----------

 Your surroundings will suddenly
 | Mini Medal #37.......[ ] |
 start looking less like a mine,
 and more | Gas
 Container........[ ] | like an
 underground shrine. There's a
 small | | building straight
 north of here, and inside o
 ----------------------------o
 it you'll find a healing
 sphere. Step into
        the sphere to get some
        nice stat recovery.
 Head east to find a similar,
 but bigger, building. There's
 several entrances to this one,
 but only one is reachable from
 down on the ground where you're
 walking. Head inside, if you
 dare!

 Alrightie! Now you're in a
 square-formed room with four
 torches in the middle. Exit in
 the northern end to find a
 small room with [MINI MEDAL
 #36] and a bottle of [MAGIC
 WATER] in. Nice! A wee bit west
 of those two chests, there are
 even more treasures: [SEED OF
 STRENGTH], [SEED OF AGILITY],
 and a heavy bag containing
 [2480 COINS]. The ones that put
 these treasures in here must be
 crying -- if they know you're
 in here, looting their stuff,
 that is! Yup! To continue after
 getting all those items, just
 go southwest to find a stairway
 leading upwards to the next
 floor. You'll arrive on higher
 ground in the room where you
 saw those four torches.

 So, move east now, but don't go
 up the stairs that you can see
 leading upwards. Instead, when
 getting to those stairs, move
 directly south to reach the
 southeastern end of the room
 with the torches. There's
 another stairway there, leading
 down to a treasury. Go down
 there to find one small room
 with one real chest (the
 eastmost chest is a Mimic
 monster) containing [MINI MEDAL
 #37]. Just north of this Mini
 Medal, there is an altar with a
 chest on, but it's guarded by a
 monster flame that won't vanish
 until you've killed Estark.
 Just ask the flame yourself, if
 you don't believe kupo!

 Now then, all silliness aside,
 please heal all your
 characters, then proceed west
 from that flame/altar. There's
 a stairway there leading
 straight to a battle. And guess
 who we're up against this time?
 It's Santa Cla--- No! It's.. a
 group of monsters guarding a
 blue giant. Talk to them, and
 refuse leaving when told to.
 Kill them using normal attacks,
 then heal yourself again before
 talking to the giant. You're
 going to fight him.. and he..
 is.. ESTARK! Waaah!

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Estark |
 DROPS: --- |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Ragnar, Meena,
 Alena |
 | MY LEVEL: 27                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Medium           
 |                              
 | - You'd think that the Lord
 would be quite a toughie to
 beat, but | | not much so if
 you're at a decent level. At
 the beginning of the | |
 battle, he will be sleeping,
 and emitting a light that can
 damage all | | your party
 members. Let all of your
 members DEFEND the first turn,
 | | except for one of them, who
 should attack Estark to wake
 him. Once | | he is awake, he
 will mostly use normal attacks,
 and sometimes breath | | a cold
 wind that damages all your
 party members, but not by a
 lot. |
 |                              
 | To successfully get through
 the battle, let Meena use her
 Midheal | | skill to heal
 someone every turn, while
 Ragnar and Alena uses normal |
 | attacks as often as they can.
 As for the hero, use the "Zap"
 skill | | do deal a bunch of
 lightning damage to Estark. |
 |                              
 | Sometimes Estark will slash
 you twice in a row, and that is
 kind of | | dangerous. When it
 happens, let the hero use
 his/hero turn to heal, | | in
 addition to Meena, who should
 always be healing others. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 That's it! You showed him!
 Examine his corpse to make sure
 that Estark really is done for,
 then try to head back
 downstairs. Psaro appears, and
 is terrified when he sees that
 you've killed the Lord of the
 Underworld! That's great! He
 shakes in his pants when he
 thinks about you (and me)!
 Maahaaaah! We're quite strong
 and scary, aren't we? Yes! Now,
 watch one of Psaro's servants
 run into the room. He says that
 something has happened to Rose,
 the girl that lives in the
 tower in Rosehill Village.
 You've visited her before,
 remember, by playing the Flute
 of Revelation. Psaro hurries
 out of the dungeon, rushing
 back to his girl Rose.

 - ESTARK IS DEAD -

 As for you, you remember that
 chest on an altar blocked by a
 flame? Go downstairs from where
 you killed Estark, and open
 that chest. The flame is gone
 now, you see. One of the best
 treasures in the whole game can
 be found hidden inside -- it's
 the [GAS CONTAINER! Think
 carefully about the word "Gas"
 for a second.... it's what that
 inventory in Riverton Village
 needed in order to make a
 flying balloon for you! Yes! We
 can get that balloon now! So
 save your game wherever you
 want to do it, and head down to
 Riverton. The inventory you got
 to talk to lives in the
 southeastern end of the
 village.

 Give the Gas Container to him
 when he asks to have it, then
 go and sleep at the inn in town
 to let him get some time to...
 invent his stuff. The man will
 give you the {AIR BALLOON} now
 -- you can travel with it on
 the world map whenever you want
 to, and using it, you can fly
 pretty much EVERYWHERE. Such
 as.. the place you need to go
 to find the missing Zenithian
 Sword! You probably remember
 that you got a treasure map
 from an old man back in Mintos.
 It's a long time ago, but it
 did place a big, red "X" on
 your world map. You can fly to
 that "X" now, using your
 balloon. It's easy to spot --
 in the eastern part of the
 world map. Land there, and
 enter the area. On the world
 map, it looks just like a tree
 in the middle of a small
 desert.

--- AIR BALLOON AND WORLD TREE -
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa519]---

 - EL FORADO -                  
 | ITEM CHECKLIST | Talk to the
 green-haired girl at the | |
 entrance. She says that this
 place is named | Power
 Shield.........[ ] | El Forado,
 and that it's been ages since a
 | Flowing Dress........[ ] |
 human last visited them. You'll
 also notice | Yggdrasil
 Leaf.......[ ] | that the
 animals here know how to talk
 human | Staff of Salvation...[
 ] | language -- they'll say
 that the World Tree, |
 Yggdrasil Dew........[ ] |
 Yggdrasil, grows here in El
 Forado. Anyway, | Zenithian
 Sword......[ ] | head over to
 the armor shop in the eastern |
 | part of town. They only sell
 two items, but o
 ----------------------------o
 they're pretty strong. Buy
 [POWER SHIELD] and [FLOWING
 DRESS] for anyone that can use
 them and at the same time has
 weaker gear equipped. If you
 gain anything by it, always buy
 new equipment! After getting
 equipped, head out on the world
 map again, and set your party
 up so that there are ONLY THREE
 MEMBERS IN YOUR BATTLE LINEUP.

 My choice was Hero, Meena and
 Ragnar, but you can of course
 choose to bring other members
 for your lineup, if you want
 to. The reason for having only
 three people in your lineup is
 that you'll meet someone soon,
 that requires a free spot in
 your lineup. So, choose your
 three-member lineup, then go
 back into El Forado. Enter the
 World Tree now, in the middle
 of the village.

 - WORLD TREE YGGDRASIL -

 Take the left stairs, and head
 out on the branch upstairs.
 Examine the leaves to get a
 [YGGDRASIL LEAF]. You can use
 it to resurrect a friend, if
 needed. Also, if you want
 several of these, you can head
 back to the world map, replace
 the character that is carrying
 the leaf you found, and then go
 and get another one. As long as
 there isn't a leaf in your
 battle lineup or bag, the game
 will let you grab new leafs as
 often as you want one. Go
 northwest from where you found
 the leaf, and open the chest
 there. It contains a [STAFF OF
 SALVATION]. Get back
 downstairs, and head up the
 stairs in the eastern part of
 the tree's entrance room. Up
 here, just move south, then
 southwest to find another
 stairway. Head up.

 Now then, you'll see a stairway
 on your left, but instead of
 going up there, go south
 instead, to find a stairway
 going upwards from the leaf
 path. It leads to a chest with
 a [YGGDRASIL DEW] inside. Take
 it, and head back downstairs.
 Now, this time you can head up
 the stairs you saw on your left
 some moments ago. It leads up
 to a big area where you can see
 the chest with the Dew on a
 small island of leaves that is
 floating in the air. That
 island however, is not
 reachable from here. So, head
 up the stairs on your east side
 instead. At the next floor's
 entrance there is an angel
 lying on the ground, wounded.
 The angel asks you to take her
 back to Zenithia, and joins
 your party. If you remembered
 to reduce your battle lineup to
 three members when I told you
 to, that is. Her name is
 Orifiela.

 Orifiela goes on to explain
 that you need the Zenithian
 Sword in order to enter
 Zenithia, and that this sword
 is actually hidden somewhere on
 Yggdrasil. And actually, it's
 on the floor you're on right
 now! Exciting! To get the
 sword, just head southwest from
 where Orifiela lied, and walk
 on that path of branches until
 you arrive in the southeastern
 part of the area. You'll see
 the [ZENITHIAN SWORD] among the
 leaves there, so pick it up!
 Now the whole Zenithian
 Equipment Set if complete!! ^_^
 Don't equip the sword yet
 though -- it isn't as strong as
 your current sword. Cast "Evac"
 to exit the World Tree. Now
 Zoom over to Porthrunnel and
 save your game there. Then fly
 west from that town in your
 balloon. When you see a small
 island in the middle of the
 sea, land there to get taken to
 a brand new (but kind of small)
 map!

--- ISLAND ADVENTURE -----------
    ----------------------------
    ---------[wa520]---

 So, how do you like the new
 map? I was o
 -----------------------------o
 getting tired of the main world
 map, after | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 all, so it's good with a small
 change. | | Anyways, you'll
 find a town just east of | Mini
 Medal #38.......[ ] | where you
 start out, so make your way |
 Mini Medal #39.......[ ] |
 there. The town's name is
 Azimuth, gateway | Spiked
 Armor.........[ ] | to
 Zenithia. Talk to all the
 preachers in | Goddess
 Ring.........[ ] | town to find
 out more about Psaro, and |
 Baron's Bugle........[ ] | make
 sure to get [MINI MEDAL #38]
 from the | Dragon
 Shield........[ ] | eastmost
 house in town. |
 Glombolero...........[ ] |
|  Yggdrasil Dew........[  ]  |
 [MINI MEDAL #39] can be found
 in the | Mini Medal #40.......[
 ] | prison, in the western part
 of town. | Seed of
 Strength.....[ ] | Before
 leaving town again (the passage
 to | Mini Medal #41.......[ ] |
 Zenithia can't be accessed now,
 after | Kerplunk Bracer......[
 ] | all) save your game, and
 consider | | buying the [SPIKED
 ARMOR] for Ragnar at o
 -----------------------------o
 the armor shop. Travel east
 from Azimuth, and head over to
 the shrine you'll find in the
 middle of a tiiiiiny desert.

 - BARON'S FOLLY -

 Welcome to Baron's Folly, the
 most dangerous place this far!
 Just kidding, there isn't a
 single enemy here -- it's a
 folly, after all. Now, let's
 play. There are several armors
 at the entrance, as well as a
 lift. Ignore them all, and head
 down the stairs instead. Follow
 the lone path down here until
 you hit the bottom room where a
 chest is standing in beautiful,
 blue light. Inside it there is
 a [GODDESS RING]. Since this is
 an MP recovery ring, let a
 magic user, such as Meena,
 equip it. Now head back
 upstairs, and get on that lift
 you ignored earlier. It goes
 downwards. When it stops, head
 back to where you first saw the
 lift again, and jump down into
 the hole that has appeared
 there now that the lift is
 gone. You'll fall down and land
 on the roof of the lift. Hop
 down south from the lift's roof
 and go downstairs to find
 [BARON'S BUGLE].

 It's a pretty entertaining
 thing -- if you use it during a
 battle, you can summon lots of
 horses that will stomp the
 enemies! Head back to Azimuth
 and save your game now! Next,
 travel south from town! If your
 feet can take it. Enter the
 building that looks like a huge
 pillar, but make sure to have
 the Hero in your lineup, and
 that he/she is wearing all the
 Sky Equipment pieces. Walk up
 the huge stairs, and open the
 gates on the top.

 - ISLAND TOWER -

 See that pool on your left?
 Above it there are some stairs
 that you got to head to the top
 of in order to reach an area
 with four stairways in. Look
 southwest to find another
 stairway leading upwards to a
 small room with a [DRAGON
 SHIELD] in. Go back down to the
 room with four stairways in,
 and this time choose the
 southeastern stairway to find a
 gate near a flying platform.
 Enter the gate to get a
 [GLOMBOLERO], then step on the
 flying platform you saw just a
 moment ago. It'll take you
 further upwards, to a new
 floor, where another similar
 gate can be found. Ignore that
 gate, and head onto the flying
 platform north of it instead.
 You'll see a building with a
 huge pillar on it's roof up
 here. Enter the building
 through the blue gate, and head
 downstairs.

 The next room has two stairs in
 it -- one in the northwestern
 end and one in the southern
 part. Head up the southern
 stairs first, to find a chest
 with a [YGGDRASIL DEW] hidden
 behind a small statue. Go
 downstairs again from this
 chest, and head up the
 northwestern stairway this
 time. There's both a flying
 platform and a huge ladder on
 your right now. Since you're a
 real tough guy/ gal, climb up
 the ladder. At the beginning of
 the room at the top, there's
 two yellow pillars. From those
 pillars, go southeast and head
 up the stairs you'll find below
 two water pools.

 Head down that tiny ladder on
 your right now, and go into the
 opening to find a room with a
 white cross-formed floor
 pattern. Stand in the middle of
 the pattern, and EXAMINE the
 ground to find [MINI MEDAL
 #40]. Now go down the stairs
 above that floor pattern.
 You'll find some barrels. They
 contain a [SEED OF STRENGTH]
 and [MINI MEDAL #41]. Nice! Now
 head back to the room with the
 two yellow pillars (at the top
 of that big ladder you
 climbed), and go up the stairs
 west of there. Go into the
 small building up here, and
 head up to the roof using the
 stairway inside. Head onto the
 flying platform on the roof.
 It'll take us even higher!
 Heeelp!

 After getting off the platform,
 open the chest on your right
 side for a [KERPLUNK BRACER].
 Then make your way to the
 middle of the room, where a BIG
 stairway leads east. Walk on
 that stairway, and get down
 from it in the eastern part of
 the room. You're now at a path
 that leads straight to a normal
 stairway in the northern end of
 the area. Go there and head
 upstairs. From here, just walk
 straight until you reach the
 very top of the tower. There is
 an altar there -- step on it to
 fly up into the sky, to
 Zenithia!

 o------------------------------

 Now that she's home again,
 Orifiela leaves the party, and
 thanks you for everything
 you've done for her -- nice
 angel girl. Zenithia is a
 rather large place, so I'll
 only go through the rooms you
 need to visit in order to find
 the items that are hidden here.
 Start by opening the door just
 left of Zenithia's entrance,
 and talk to the green devil
 who's walking around down here
 to get a [YGGDRASIL DEW] from
 him! Nice devil kid! If you
 want one later, you can come
 back to him after you've used
 your current dew. To get [MINI
 MEDAL #42], peek into the
 drawer in the room just right
 of where the green devil is!
 Bingo! From here, run a bit
 east to find a stairway leading
 down to the lowest point of
 Zenithia Castle.

 Orifiela's waiting for you down
 here, and she has a present for
 you: [SPARKIE] is a dragon that
 you can put in your party.
 He'll help you during battles,
 but you can't take direct
 control over him, so using him
 a lot is rather risky. Before
 leaving the room, examine the
 ground just east of where
 Orifiela is standing -- you'll
 find a surprise: [MINI MEDAL
 #43].

 Go back to the entrance of
 Zenithia now, and enter the
 main gates, just north of the
 entrance. A dragon's waiting
 for you in here, but it's not a
 mean one. Speak to the Zenith
 Dragon. The dragon says that
 even he, is not able to stop
 Psaro's evil plans as this
 point. Then everything goes
 dark -- apparently, Psaro's
 just launched an attack on
 Zenithia, since he knows you're
 here. It wasn't a big one
 though -- everything is safe
 again the next moment. Continue
 listening to the Zenith Dragon,
 who says you are everyone's
 last hope in the battle against
 Psaro. You're actually kind of
 important! To show that he
 isn't just joking, the dragon
 gives you lots of EXP points,
 and powers up your Zenithian
 Sword, so that it'll do more
 damage when you use it.

 After powering you up, the
 Zenith Dragon tells you to
 leave. Your next destination,
 he says, is the Underworld of
 Nadiria. To get started on your
 journey there, head back
 downstairs to where Orifiela
 is. Exit that room in the
 southern end to find a hole in
 the clouds that you can drop
 down into.

 - NADIRIA ENTRANCE DUNGEON -

 Now that you've dropped through
 the hole in the clouds, you'll
 fall down onto the island below
 Zenithia again. You'll be
 surrounded by mountains, and
 the only place you can really
 go now, is into the dungeon
 between those mountains. Head
 inside to find the Nadiria
 Entrance Dungeon (Ok, I made
 that name up!). Please don't be
 angry at poor kupo because of
 that. Anyway, from the
 beginning of the dungeon, go
 two screens north to find a
 room with a chest and a small
 pool in. Open the chest to get
 a [SHIMMERING DRESS] that you
 can consider equipping on
 Meena. Head one screen back
 south from here, then one
 screen west. Follow the path
 north now, and when it bends
 westwards, keep on following
 the very same path. You will
 end up at a small set of stairs
 quite soon. From those stairs,
 go one screen west.

 Now you're in a room with some
 of those all-too-familiar arrow
 pads on the ground. Step on the
 rightmost arrow-pads to be
 taken to a chest in the
 southeastern part of the room.
 It contains a shiny [MINI MEDAL
 #44]. Now that you have this
 medal, exit the room using the
 entrance you came from. Back at
 those stairs from before,
 continue your journey south
 through the corridor. There are
 no more forks for a while now,
 so just follow the one and only
 path there is until you find
 another small stairway like the
 previous one, with a passage
 leading west. Don't head in
 there -- instead, continue
 south from the stairs. Follow
 the path straight until you
 arrive in a room with purple
 poison on the ground. You'll
 know it when you see it.

 As you already know everything
 about, stepping on poison is
 very dangerous. To avoid taking
 damage however, just cast
 Maya's Safe Passage spell, then
 you can wade through the poison
 and get the [MIGHTY ARMLET]
 which is waiting for you in the
 absolute northwestern part of
 the room. Go get it, already!
 Remember to equip it on one of
 your characters; I chose the
 Hero. Now go to the southern
 part of the room to find
 another [FLOWING DRESS] in a
 chest. Anyway, with the Armlet
 equipped, you're ready to go
 back to the last stairway you
 saw. Go back there, and this
 time head one screen west from
 it.

 Continue west for a couple of
 seconds to find a chest on the
 ground. Open it if you want to
 get the [THALIAN STAFF], then
 proceed south to find some more
 poisoned ground on your right
 hand side. There's a chest in
 the middle of all the poison --
 it's just a mimic monster, so
 you can ignore it. Follow the
 path east from the mimic (just
 ignore all those chests you can
 see on the other side of a
 wall) and head upstairs once
 you see a stairway.

 The next floor is another area
 with arrow pads. First of all,
 step on the ones in the
 southwestern end of the area to
 find a chest with a [HELA'S
 ARMOR] in it. This armor is
 cursed, for your information.
 Now, step on the arrows leading
 east from the Hela's Armor
 chest. They'll take you over to
 a stairway that's placed
 between four squares on the
 ground. Head downstairs to find
 FOUR treasure chests! They
 contain [3280 COINS], [SEED OF
 LIFE], [SEED OF STRENGTH] and a
 [SEED OF AGILITY]. Take all of
 those items, then proceed down
 the stairs southwest of the
 four chests.

 So... what's waiting for us
 down here? It's.. a.. RAFT!?
 Yeah, it sure seems like that!
 Step on the raft and sail a
 tiny bit east. Once you see a
 small, small island with some
 stairs on, get off there, and
 head downstairs. Walk west
 through the corridor here, and
 you'll find another stairway
 between four pillars. Examine
 the ground above these pillars
 to find a [SEED OF RESILIENCE].
 Eat it, then run downstairs!
 Open the huge, red gate in
 front of your eyes, then crawl
 your way south, where another
 red gate can be found next to a
 demon statue. Head outside,
 and... DUNGEON COMPLETE BEIBII!
 "Phew!" for real! Yep!

 - MAGMA CAVE -

 Walk south to the other side of
 the bridge, then jump down into
 the black hole next to the
 stairway. Open the chest down
 here to get the [MIRROR SHIELD]
 for Ragnar, then fall further
 down, to the very bottom. Head
 up the stairs on your right to
 get a [SEED OF LIFE], then go
 downstairs twice to reach the
 world map again. Travel south
 to the nearby shrine, Heaven's
 Haven. After visiting the
 shrine, I suggest Zooming back
 to Azimuth in order to heal and
 save. Do that, then return to
 Heaven's Haven again, by
 Zooming. While it is indeed
 possible to save at the
 beginning of Heaven's Haven, my
 game froze the first time I
 tried to do it, for your
 information. Anyway, when
 you're ready, get back to
 Heaven's Haven to continue.

--- HEAVEN'S HAVEN AND THE FOUR
    BARRIERS -------------------
    ---------[wa522]---

 o----------------------------o
 There's nothing but a small,
 yellow flame | ITEM CHECKLIST |
 in this room. Examine it, and
 it'll turn | | into an angel.
 The angel explains that in |
 Dragon Shield........[ ] |
 order to stop Psaro, you'll
 first have to | Miracle
 Sword........[ ] | shut down
 four magic barriers. Finish |
 Oaken Club...........[ ] |
 talking with the angel, then go
 outside of | Zombie
 Mail..........[ ] | the shrine
 again. Your next destination is
 | | located just east of here
 -- it's a o
 ----------------------------o
 shrine-like building in the
 middle of a
     purple pool of poison.

 Head down the stairs in the
 entrance corridor. Down here
 you'll find a big, purple
 dragon who says that it's the
 guardian of the first barrier.
 The dragon says there's nothing
 to do but fight, so let's take
 him down. Too bad for Mister
 Dragon, isn't it? Anyway,
 during battle, there are three
 smaller dragons you'll have to
 deal with.

 | - Since the 3 dragons can
 call for backup once one of
 their mates are | | killed, you
 need to try and deal equal
 damage to all of them, so | |
 that they're all killed around

 "Kaswoosh" | | ability to deal
 lots of damage to all dragons
 at once, and let the | | other
 three party members do normal
 attacks to not one of the | |
 dragons, but to them all. The
 battle isn't really worth
 listing as a | | boss battle
 though, as each dragon has less
 than 500 HP each. |
 |

 Since you're done here, head
 back to the shrine where you
 met the angel earlier. Talk to
 her in order to heal your
 HP/MP, then go visit the next
 barrier shrine, which can be
 found northwest of the angel's
 shrine. There's a ladder near
 the entrance! Climb to the top!
 Talk to the monstrous monster
 who's waiting for you. Kick
 it's butt! Or, try to do so, at
 least.

 order to | | neutralize it.
 Even now however, you're going
 to take some damage, | | so
 watch everyone's HP, and use
 the Hero's "Omniheal" to heal
 everyone | | back to perfect
 health when needed. |
 |                              
 | When healing isn't needed,
 spam Barbatos with normal
 attacks. He'll | | go down
 after three-four minutes. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 As you can see, Barbatos
 dropped a Miracle Sword. It'll
 restore the user's HP every
 single time he/she attacks, so
 make sure to let someone such
 as Ragnar equip it. Go back to
 the angel shrine to heal and
 save now, then head over to the
 third shrine. You'll find it
 west of the angel shrine. Head
 downstairs in this shrine to
 find some moving statues.
 Touching them will not damage
 you, but you'll get teleported
 back upstairs.

 - STATUES PUZZLE: From the
   beginning of the floor with
   the moving statues,
   just move a few steps east
   from the beginning, then walk
   north. It's an incredibly
   easy way of passing between
   the middle statue and the one
   just east of it. Remember,
   from the beginning, take a
   few steps east, then just
   walk north. Head down the
   stairs just north of the
   statues now. Down here, talk
   to the monster who's waiting
   for you two times. This leads
   to another boss battle, as
   you may have suspected
   yourself. I'm sure you did,
   actually.

 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Pruslas |
 DROPS: [OAKEN CLUB] |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Ragnar, Meena,
 Alena |
 | MY LEVEL: 33                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Medium           
 |                              
 | - This battle is very
 straight-forward, as Pruslas is
 a typical "all | | muscles, no
 brain" kind of enemy. He's very
 vulnerable towards normal | |
 attacks, so if you're using the
 same battle lineup as I am, you
 won't | | have to bother with
 spells at all, except for when
 you need to heal. | | From time
 to time, Pruslas gets to attack
 twice per turn, and since | |
 his attacks are so powerful, I
 recommend never letting anyone
 in your | | party's HP drop
 below 50%. Meena's "Fullheal"
 skill does wonders here, | | as
 you'll never need to heal more
 than one friend at once. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Pruslas doesn't have anything
 to say before hitting the floor
 -- he just dies there like a
 normal monster. I'm sure he'll
 regret the way he chose to go
 out later, when he reaches the
 afterworld. Saying NOTHING is
 just.. not worthy. Anyway, head
 back to the angel shrine to
 save and heal, then travel to
 the fourth and final shrine.
 It's located far northeast from
 the angel shrine.

 From the entrance of the fourth
 shrine, head up the stairs near
 the entrance. At the next
 floor, go east through a door,
 and head up some new stairs
 northeast of the door. To your
 south now, there's a treasure
 chest containing the awesome-
 lookin' [ZOMBIE MAIL]!
 Unfortunately, it's cursed.
 Head one floor downstairs from
 the chest now, and head up the
 stairs southwest of that door
 you went through earlier. Now
 just continue following the
 only path that exists until you
 reach the boss chamber, where a
 dark priest is waiting. The
 priest says you've come too
 late -- Psaro has already
 evolved into his ultimate form,
 the most evil, nasty form ever!
 Or something! Not good -- now
 you'll have to fight the priest
 too! Will this ever stop?

 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Aamon | DROPS:

 | PARTY: Hero, Ragnar, Meena,
 Alena |
 | MY LEVEL: 33                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Medium           
 |                              
 | - Ready? Okai. Aamon has
 three ghoul helpers that will
 keep Meena | | occupied most of
 the time. Use her "Kaswoosh"
 spell to deal with them, | |
 then let her heal the others
 from time to time, when they
 need it. | | As for the Hero,
 let him/her USE the Zenithian
 Sword as an item, in | | order
 to remove the protective spell
 that Aamon has cast on himself.
 | | If he casts it once again,
 remove it using the same
 method. | | The lineup that I
 (we?) are using is really
 suited for doing melee | |
 damage, so normal attacks are
 recommended. If you want to use
 | | spells to attack, make sure
 you've removed Aamon's
 protective spell | | first. If
 you want to live. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Alrightie! All of the four
 barriers have been removed now.
 This means that we've got
 access to the last proper
 dungeon in Dragon Quest IV now!
 It's located just north of the
 angel shrine. Before going
 there, make sure you remember
 to save and heal first.
 Forgetting that won't lead to
 anything but frustration.
 Believe me. If you want to.

--- DEATH CASTLE ---------------

 Walk north past the statues at
 the entrance, o
 ----------------------------o
 and open the door that leads
 into the castle | ITEM
 CHECKLIST | itself. In the next
 room, there's three | |
 humanoid statues that will try
 to ram you, | Mini Medal
 #45.......[ ] | as well as some
 electrified floor. Use | Sage's
 Stone.........[ ] | Maya's
 "Safe Passage" skill to avoid
 taking | Yggdrasil Leaf.......[
 ] | damage from the electrified
 ground, then | Lightning
 Staff......[ ] | just make your
 way northeast from here, | |
 trying to avoid the humanoid
 statues. Keep o
 ----------------------------o
 on walking until you find some
 stairs in the southeastern end
 of the area. Head upstairs.

 Up on the next floor, head one
 screen south to find a skeleton
 lying on the ground. It's dead
 of course, so don't try and eat
 it or anything. Head inside the
 door just north of the
 skeleton.

 Just keep on walking through
 the corridor now, until you can
 see some stairs next to a
 flame, leading downwards. Head
 down those stairs, and use
 Maya's "Safe Passage" to avoid
 poison damage (the basement is
 filled with poison). Now run
 over to the southwestern part
 of the poisoned basement to
 find a chest containing [MINI
 MEDAL #45]! Go back upstairs to
 where that flame is now. When
 standing right next to the
 flame, go east to find some new
 stairs. Follow them up to the
 next floor, if you dare. Oh,
 yes, you MUST dare, by the way.

 Walk south past all of those
 scary statues, and out the door
 at the end of the corridor. On
 this small balcony, just head
 into the door on your left.
 What you're seeing in front of
 you now, is an elevator. Avoid
 activating it for now, and
 continue north instead, up
 another stairway. The next room
 has tons of statues in it, and
 there's a secret to them. Try
 walking a bit east from the
 beginning of the room, then
 look closely at the statues in
 the northern part of the room.
 One of them is covering a
 passage! Push the statue away
 to uncover the passage, and
 head inside to find a secret
 path that leads down to one of
 the castle's balconies, where
 the [SAGE'S STONE] can be
 found! It'll come in handy when
 you're out of MP, and need to
 heal in battle. Now, head back
 to the room where you pushed
 that statue a few minutes ago.

 Instead of pushing more
 statues, this time head out of
 the door that's located in the
 eastern end of the statue room.
 Keep on walking east from there
 until you find two chests.
 Inside them, you'll find an
 [YGGDRASIL LEAF] and the
 [LIGHTNING STAFF]. With those
 items in your inventory, head
 back to the elevator and
 activate it. It'll take you
 some floors downwards, back to
 where that flame is, if you
 remember it.

 Once the elevator has stopped,
 head up the stairs at the end
 of the nearby corridor. At the
 next floor, there's a corpse on
 the ground. Ignore it, and walk
 north from the dead chap, into
 another elevator. Activate it,
 and have it take you another
 floor downwards. Step out of
 the elevator, and head up the
 stairs just northwest of here.
 Now you'll be able to walk on
 the floor of the elevator, so
 do that. Get onto the floor of
 the elevator above the corpse,
 and continue north from there
 to reach a new floor. Keep on
 walking through the corridor
 until you see a pool of water.
 Head south from the pool, then
 northwest to find a room that
 looks like a stone cave.
 There's a gate in the northern
 part of this cave room, so open
 it up and head through.

 You'll see a huge volcano in
 front of you now. That's where
 you need to go next. Once in
 the volcano area, make sure to
 heal everyone, then use the
 Baron's Bugle item in order to
 summon your Mary Lou horse
 wagon. If you don't do this,
 you won't be able to change
 your battle-lineup during the
 shortly upcoming battle
 against... You know who. Run
 north to face this fiend. It's
 Psaro, of course. There are
 seven different forms that
 you'll have to defeat, so try
 not to exhaust yourself too
 quickly. Remember that your MP
 will NOT be restored between
 Psaro's various forms. So,
 don't use it all at once!

 It's also a good idea to let
 someone in your lineup (Meena,
 for example) carry the Sage's
 Stone, and use it from time to
 time in order to restore
 everyone's HP without having to
 use MP. But now... Let's go
 crazy. :-)

 - PLEASE NOTE: I wouldn't
   recommend starting this
   battle if you don't have the
   Sage's Stone (which can be
   found in Death Castle), since
   it lets you heal all of your
   party members throughout the
   whole battle, without having
   to spend any MP. So, make
   sure you have that stone, and
   that someone in your party is
   carrying it.

 .------------------------------
 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Psaro the
 Manslayer | DROPS: --- |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Ragnar, Meena,
 Alena |
 | MY LEVEL: 37                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Hard             
 |                              
 | - FORM I: The first form is
 nothing special. Psaro will
 mostly slash | | around with
 his sabre, hitting one of you
 party members each time. | |
 Let everyone in your party
 attack him using normal attacks
 except | | for the one that
 carries the Sage's Stone. This
 party member should | | use the
 stone pretty much every turn,
 in order to keep everyone's | |
 health on a.... healthy level.
 When you've fought for a while,
 Psaro's | | arm is blown off
 from his body. BOOM-SHACKA-
 LACKYA. |
 |                              
 | - FORM II: Continue playing
 like during the first form. You
 might want | | to use the
 Hero's "Omniheal" at the
 beginning though, to get all of
 | | your comrades back to 100%
 HP. When you're done the second
 hand flies |
 |    off from Psaro's body.    
 |                              
 | - FORM III: Now that both of
 his arms are gone, Psaro
 changes his attack | | pattern.
 Instead of going one-on-one
 with your party members, he | |
 starts using attacks that hit
 several party members at once.
 These | | attacks tend to do
 less damage however, which is
 great if you're | | using the
 Sage's Stone to heal everyone
 often. If Psaro casts any | |
 spells on himself (the one that
 boosts his DEF, for example),
 just | | use the Zenithian
 Sword as an item during battle,
 in order to remove | | the
 effect of those spells. If
 anyone in your party dies, use
 the | | "Zing" spell to revive
 them. The Hero, Meena and Kiryl
 knows it. | | When you're done
 with this third form, Psaro's
 head goes airborne. |
 |                              
 | - FORM IV: Psaro's gone
 batshit crazy! A head now
 appears on his belly, | | and
 starts doing all kinds of
 elemental attacks. Cast Meena's
 | | "Insulatle" to try and
 neutralize the damage of those
 attacks. Once | | you've cast
 that spell, continue attacking
 like normal, and healing | |
 using the Sage's Stone. Psaro
 will heal himself from time to
 time, | | but you should be
 able to deal more damage to
 him, than he is able | | to
 heal -- just keep on letting
 Hero/Alena/Ragnar use normal
 moves. | | If Psaro breathes on
 you, removing the Insulatle
 effect from your | | party,
 make sure to recast it. Once
 this form bites the dust, hands
 |
 |    grow out of Psaro's ears. 
 |                              
 | - FORM V: The battle
 continues like before, so don't
 change your attack | | pattern.
 Just let me mention once again,
 that it's important you've | |
 got the "Insulatle" spell cast
 at all times, in order to
 neutralize | | some of that
 elemental damage! Oh, and don't
 forget about the Sage's | |
 Stone -- use it every single
 turn. Once you're done, Psaro
 grows some |
 |    real nasty feet!          
 |                              
 | - FORM VI: No big changes.
 Continue like before. Psaro
 will step on | | you from time
 to time, but the damage he
 deals isn't a lot worse | |
 than before in any way. For the
 next form, Psaro gains a new
 head, | | devil horns, and a
 grim, grim look. |
 |                              
 | - FORM VII: So, final form
 now. It's important that the
 "Insulatle" | | spell is active
 at all times -- without it,
 you're dead meat. Use | | the
 Zenithian Sword as an item to
 remove Psaro's self-boosting |
 | effects, then continue like
 before. Don't worry though,
 Psaro won't | | last for very
 long once you reach the last
 form. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Psaro's body feels so... so..
 incredibly HOT, he says -- then
 he explodes! There's no blood
 though, just Psaro back in his
 old humanoid form. Everything's
 chaos though, since Psaro's
 energy is gone, and there's
 nothing left here to support
 the volcano you've been
 fighting in. Just before it
 collapses, someone you know
 comes to get you, and takes you
 back to Zenithia. Once there,
 all of your party members get
 to know that they've all proven
 themselves worthy, and have
 finished their tasks.

 When you're back in control of
 your party again, it's time to
 leave Zenithia. Watch the cut-
 scene where your party members
 are all followed back to their
 homes, and the hero's home
 village restored to prosperity.
 Don't turn off the game just
 yet; watch the ending credits
 first, then save your game when
 asked to do so. There's still
 content left for us to play
 through!

================================

       POST-ADVENTURE CONTENT
       [wa600]

================================

 After you've watched all the
 ending credits and saved your
 game, you can reload your
 savegame in order to start a
 sixth chapter. A new dungeon
 has been unlocked now, and
 after we've completed it, Psaro
 himself is going to join our
 party. You'd like that, right?
 Right! Anyways, to reach the
 extra dungeon, make your way
 back to Azimuth, and go to
 where the king is. A hole has
 appeared in the ground near
 him, so hop in! That's how you
 access the dungeon.

 o------------------------------

 The first room is as basic as a
 room can be! Theres a ladder
 on your right (in case you want
 to get back out from the
 dungeon) and a door just north
 of the entrance. So, open that
 door and head through to the
 next screen. This room is very
 straight-forward as well, so
 just follow the path and head
 down the stairs that are
 impossible to miss in order to
 reach a new room.

 Now, in here, youll see a door
 in the very northern end of the
 room. Ignore the door for now,
 and follow the path leading
 northeast instead. This path
 will take you to a set of
 stairs in the northeastern end
 of the room. Follow the stairs
 to another room where a raft is
 waiting for you.

 Board the raft and sail south
 to find two chests. The
 rightmost one is really a
 Pandoras Box, while the
 leftmost one contains one of
 those shiny, little, reward-
 giving medals - its [MINI
 MEDAL #46]! After getting the
 medal, head back to the
 beginning of this room, and
 make your way northwest to find
 a [STRENGTH RING]. From here,
 sail all the way to the
 southwestern end of the area,
 and leave your raft there,
 walking onto the elevated path
 here. Itll lead you to a chest
 containing an [YGGDRASIL LEAF].
 Now you have all the items in
 the area with the raft, so head
 back to the room you visited
 before. This time, you need to
 head through the door in the
 northern end  its the one I
 told you to ignore earlier,
 remember?

 In this room, just take the
 eastern path to find [MINI
 MEDAL #47], and afterwards make
 your way northeast to find some
 stairs. Climb down to reach an
 area with lots and lots of
 bridges - the bridge room,
 kinda, if you feel like
 attaching names on areas. So,
 from the beginning of the
 bridge room, head west across
 two bridges to get [AGILITY
 SEED]. After that, go back to
 the start of the room, and head
 east across three bridges.
 Youll find yourself in a
 forked bridge. Take the eastern
 fork to get [MINI MEDAL #48],
 then take the other fork to
 find some stairs. Head down.

 - AFTER THE BRIDGE ROOM -

 Youll see a house down here,
 so enter it. Theres nothing
 interesting in here - just
 head down the stairs right
 away, in order to find... Woah!
 Another house! Before heading
 into this second house, drop
 down into the well outside and
 grab [MINI MEDAL #49] at the
 bottom. Head up again, and move
 into the second house. Theres
 an inn in this second house, so
 rest there, then use the stairs
 in here to head down into the
 basement.

In the inn basement, there is a
room in the northwestern end
which is locked
 by a door you need the Ultimate
 Key to open. To reach this
 room, just head south from the
 beginning, and when you see a
 path leading west, follow it.
 Inside the room there is a
 chest containing a [SEED OF
 RESILIENCE] and another
 containign [1,200 COINS]. Now,
 there is a Pandoras Box in the
 basement as well, but we dont
 want to annoy it or anything,
 do we? No! Head back upstairs,
 and exit the inn instead.
 Outside of the inn, head north
 and go through the door located
 there. In the next area, follow
 the stairs on your right to
 find a chest, then head back
 upstairs and go north across a
 bridge. Next, head down the
 stairs on the other side of the
 bridge.

 Its rather hot down here...
 right? Sure is, because now
 youre in a LAVA ROOM. Sweat is
 dripping from your eyes!
 Flowing out! Anyway, follow the
 one-way path to find a chest
 containing the cursed [DEATH
 MASK]. Next, take the western
 path and follow it until you
 reach a fork, at which you need
 to head north and keep walking
 in that direction until you hit
 some stairs taking you to a new
 screen where lots of lava is
 surrounding a tower. Turn your
 nose left from here and walk
 west past a fork leading north,
 to find the EXP-granting
 [ELEVATING SHOES] in a chest.
 Head back to the fork now, and
 head north from there, into the
 tower, through its gate.

 - INSIDE THE TOWER -

 We're in a pretty big room now,
 and there's elevated paths on
 both you left and right side.
 Head right first to find a
 chest with a [SEED OF LIFE]
 inside. Afterwards, follow the
 elevated path on the left
 instead. It leads to the
 northern half of the current
 floor. In the northeastern end
 of the area there are some
 stairs leading up to a new
 screen where a [COBRA CLAW] can
 be found. Take the item, and go
 back downstairs. Next, make
 your way to the very
 northwestern end of the floor,
 where there is another stairway
 leading up to brand new floor.
 Go up to that floor right now.

 There's a hole in the ground up
 here, so let your scrawny body
 fall straight into it. It's not
 dangerous, kupo guarantees your
 safety. Anyway, you'll fall
 down into the middle of the
 previous floor now, and there
 are some stairs here that you
 should walk down to reach a new
 screen.

 This room has a Pandora's Box
 in the middle -- just ignore
 that one, and go to the
 elevated path on your right.
 You'll see some holes/gaps in
 the wall up on the elevated
 path, but ignore them for now,
 and follow the elevated path
 south. When it bends west, keep
 on following it. On your
 northern side you'll soon see
 one of those gaps/holes aligned
 with a pool of water. Walk into
 that gap/hole. You'll now find
 yourself on an invisible path.
 Follow the invisible path until
 you reach a chest with a [ROBE
 OF SERENITY] inside, then jump
 down and head into a door
 leading north.

 In the next area there are no
 monsters at all. There's a
 chest though, so just follow
 the path until you see it.
 There's poison on the ground
 however, so use the Safe
 Passage spell to avoid taking
 damage. Open the chest for
 [1,600 COINS], before heading
 further left, where a church is
 located. Save your game in the
 church, and exit north! Good
 going so far, brave hero!!

 - AFTER SAVING AT THE CHURCH 

 Run north to find some graves
 with a flashing spot on the
 nearby ground. Examine it to
 reveal [MINI MEDAL #50]. Travel
 northwest to a stairway. Climb
 it, and climb some more to find
 a [ANGEL LEOTARD]. Backtrack to
 where the graves are, and head
 northeast from here this time.
 Youll find a village-ish area
 with several barrels with items
 in them, and a cell gate.
 Unlock it, and head up the
 stairs on the other side.

 Now that youve climbed the
 stairs behind the cell door,
 make your way southwest for a
 new chest. From the chest, head
 north, then southeast until you
 see another chest containing
 the [DEMON LANCE]. There are
 two more chests in the village-
 ish area as well, with a smelly
 [HORSE MANURE] and a more
 useful pair of [BOXER TRUNKS]
 inside. After opening the
 chests, exit north. The next
 room is very easy to get
 through, and this is where
 [MINI MEDAL #51] and a
 [KERPLUNK BRACER] can be found.
 Continue by exiting the current
 area to find a room with many
 ladders in.

 Head downwards in the ladder
 area, and youll see two
 ladders: one long and one
 short. Climb down the long one
 to get a [RECOVERY RING], then
 head down the short one.
 Continue downwards once, then
 head west to find a big ladder.
 It leads to another chest with
 a Mimic Monster inside. Now
 youre ready to head down to
 the very bottom of the area,
 and exit in the eastern end, to
 a new screen. Welcome to the
 final room before the boss
 battle youve probably been
 waiting for. Theres many
 elevated paths in here, but the
 rooms design is very simple.
 Open the chests in here to get
 the powerful [DEMON SPEAR] and
 a [RUBY OF PROTECTION]. Now
 exit in the northern end, and
 prepare for battle!

 | BOSS SHOWDOWN: Foo Yung &
 Chow Mein | DROPS: [1400~
 COINS] |
 |------------------------------
 | PARTY: Hero, Borya, Kiryl,
 Ragnar |
 | MY LEVEL: 43                 
 | DIFFICULTY: Hard             
 |                              
 | - Your main objective is to
 take out Foo Yung first,
 because he casts | | protective
 spells which are annoying.
 Start off with the hero | |
 attacking him, Borya casting
 Accelerate, Kiryl casting
 Kabuff for 2-3 | | turns in a
 row and Ragnar attacking, since
 we need to deal some | |
 serious damage to Foo Yung.
 Sometimes, Foo Yung and Chow
 Mein will do | | their strong
 attacks, Foo Yung spitting
 cold/hot breath, and Chow | |
 Mein throwing a boulder. If
 this happens, use omniheal.
 Also, have | | Borya to cast
 Sap, it'll be useful, and Oomph
 on Hero and Ragnar. |
 |                              
 | These guys shouldn't be too
 much of a problem -- once Foo
 Yung is | | out, Chow Mein will
 be pretty easy. |
 |                              
 '------------------------------

 Now that these guys have been
 defeated, a rare flower will
 bloom ontop of the Yggdrasil
 Tree (located in El Florado
 Village). We want that flower,
 so jump into the whole behind
 your dead foes, in order to be
 taken back to Azimuth. From
 there, go to El Florado, and
 climb to the top of the
 Yggdrasil Tree. Take the
 [YGGDRASIL FLOWER] which is
 waiting for you at the top.
 With the flower resting safe in
 your pocket, zoom over to
 Rosehill Village, and go to
 Rose's tomb, near the white
 yeti monster. Use the flower to
 resurrect Rose and have her
 join your party.

 Now it's time to travel to
 Heaven's Haven. Travel through
 the castle to find Psaro. Let
 Rose talk to him, in order to
 have him join your party as a
 playable character. He already
 knows several spells, and will
 learn even more of them when he
 levels up. Some of his spells
 won't even cost MP when you
 cast them! So, now your party
 is complete -- no one will join
 you after Psaro has teamed up
 with you! But that's OK with
 me. And with you, too!

 As for what we've got left to
 do in Dragon Quest IV, there's
 still a boss named Aamon that
 needs some serious beating!
 Let's bring Psaro with us and
 show him who's the strongest!
 As a nice bonus, Psaro knows a
 lot of spells, and does not
 take any damage from equipping
 cured items.

       MINI MEDAL REWARDS
       [mi001]

================================

 The Mini Medals that you find
 throughout your adventure can
 be exchanged for some really
 great awards. Once you get
 Torneko's ship during Chapter
 V, sail to the small island in
 the very northeastern end of
 the world map to find a castle.
 Inside, you'll find the Mini
 Medal King, who will reward you
 if you have enough medals.
 There are more than 60 medals
 in the game, but one you've
 found 60 of them, there won't
 be any more rewards to get.

        CASINO                  

================================

 When you're tired of playing
 through the storyline in Dragon
 Quest IV, you can take a
 relaxing break at one of the
 game's two casinos. The second
 casino should be particularily
 interesting, but visiting the
 first one isn't a dumb idea if
 you're still far from the end
 of the game. The casinos both
 have a set of games that you
 can play in order to win a
 special currency: casino coins.
 The casino coins you win, can
 in turn be exchanged for the
 prizes listed in the two
 diagrams below. Note that there
 is no way to buy the casino
 prizes using real coins --
 you've got to earn casino coins
 instead!

 - CASINO I: The first of the
   two casinos that exist in
   Dragon Quest IV is
   found in the tavern in Endor,
   and can be accessed as early
   as during Chapter II. The
   prizes you win in this casino
   aren't too shabby, but are
   easily beat by the ones you
   can earn in the second
   casino. I would not recommend
   spending a lot of time at the
   casino, as all the stuff you
   can win here is weaker than
   the equipment you'll find
   later in the game. Check out
   the second casino instead!

 - CASINO II: The only way to
   reach this second, supreme
   casino, is to make
   progress with the Pioneer
   Town until it is at it's
   final stage. If you're
   wondering how to get to that
   point, please take a look at
   the Pioneer Town section in
   this guide. Anyway, this
   second casino's final prizes
   are way superior to the ones
   found in the first casino,
   both when thinking item value
   and equipment stats. The best
   prize of them all -- the
   Liquid Metal Helm -- is
   easily among the best and
   most valuable items in the
   whole game.

 Please forgive me for not
 including an in-depth guide for
 the various casino games that
 you can play. Such descriptions
 are not within my Dragon Quest
 IV walkthrough's scope, unless
 someone wants to help me with
 it. I deeply apologize for
 this.

       STORYLINE ITEMS [de002]

 |--------------------------|---
 | Talaria | A pair of
 legendaric shoes that can send
 a | | | person flying up into
 the sky, and land at | | | far
 away from his/her original
 location. | | | Ragnar McRyan
 uses them during Chapter I to |
 | | reach the island west of
 Strathbaile, were | | | the
 missing kids he is looking for
 are | | | trapped. Fanciest
 shoes ever! |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Armlet of | The armlet is
 Vrenor Town's biggest treasure,
 | | Transmutation | and is kept
 safe in the cave known as | | |
 "Vault of Vrenor", south of
 town. A bad gang | | | of
 kidnappers want the armlet in
 return for | | | releasing a
 girl they've taken hostage. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Thief's Key | This is a
 special key that is so well-
 made | | | it can be used to
 open all BLUE doors in the | |
 | entire world of Dragon Quest
 IV! Alena | | | receives is in
 Chapter II, after handing the |
 | | Armlet of Transmutation
 over to the kidnappers |

 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | {Salary / Earnings} | Not an
 item per ee, but it's kind of
 fits | | | into this section.
 At the beginning of | | |
 Chapter III, Torneko will
 receive salary at | | | the end
 of the day, after working at
 the shop | | | in Lakanaba
 Village. The salary is always |
 | | about 1/10 of the total
 earnings Torneko has | | | made
 off of selling stuff at the
 shop. |
 |                          |   
 | | At the end of Chapter III,
 when Torneko has | | | his very
 own shop, you will earn much,
 much | | | more; about twice as
 much as the items you | | |
 sell are really worth. Talk to
 Torneko's wife | | | in order
 to put items up for sale and
 collect |
 |                          | yo
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Prince's Letter | The Prince
 of Ballymoral Castle is in love
 | | | with the Princess of
 Endor, and gives Torneko | | |
 a letter when the two of them
 meet during | | | night.
 Torneko has to take the letter
 to the |

 |                          |

 | Royal Scroll | A letter from
 the King of Endor to the King |
 | | of Ballymoral. The letter
 was written in | | | order to
 maintain peace between the two
 | | | nations, and to let the
 prince and princess |

 | Steel Strongbox | Normally
 when you die, you lose 50% of
 the | | | gold you are
 carrying. If you have this box
 | | | however, you won't lose a
 Dime! Or Zenny! | | | During
 Chapter III, that is... |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Silver Goddess Statue | This
 statue is found in a cave
 northeast | | | of Endor. An
 old man in Endor buys it from |
 | | Torneko for a whoopin'
 25,000 Coins. During a | | |
 "normal" playthrough, these
 coins are what | | | makes it
 possible to get Torneko his own
 shop. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Night Light | An item found
 at the place Oojam joins your |
 | | party during Chapter IV. By
 using it, you | | | can switch
 between day and night whenever

 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Sphere of Silence | Found in
 the same dungeon as Oojam and
 the | | | Night Light. This
 sphere can be used during | | |
 battle to seal a monster's
 magic attacks. It | | | comes
 in handy during Maya and
 Meena's fight |
 |                          | ag
 +--------------------------+---
 | Powder Keg | A keg of
 explosive powder found in Mamon
 Mine. | | | You'll have to blow
 it up outside of the | | |
 Chancellor's room in order to
 progress with |

 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Boarding Pass | A pass which
 is needed for everyone who
 wants | | | to travel with the
 ships docked in Havré Leon | |
 | Town. An old man (guess who!)
 gives it to | | | the sisters
 at the very end of Chapter IV.
 |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Big Book Of Beasts | All the
 monsters you meet will be
 indexed in | | | this book,
 which can be accessed from the
 item | | | menu while walking
 around on the world map. | | |
 The book contains details such
 as Monster #, | | | experience
 given and coins dropped. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Symbol Of Faith | Hidden in
 The Cave of Betrayal, this is a
 | | | treasure that has a lot
 of sentimental value | | | to a
 man named Hank Hoffman Junior.
 He thinks | | | he was betrayed
 by his best friend while | | |
 searching for this treasure,
 and will only | | | let your
 party borrow his horse wagon if
 you |
 |                          | ge
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | {Mary Lou} | Another "item"
 that isn't really an item per |
 | | se, but still fits nicely
 into this section. | | | Mary
 Lou is Hoffman's horse, and is
 the only | | | creature with
 guts enough to take you through
 | | | the desert southeast of
 Casabranca. You could | | |
 compare her to a vehicle, but
 this horse's got |
 |                          | so
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | {Torneko's Ship} | This is a
 ship that Torneko buys after
 you | | | shave cleared the
 Lighthouse during Chapter V. |
 | | It makes traveling on the
 world map much | | | easier,
 since you can sail between all
 the | | | continents in the
 world of Dragon Quest IV. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Holy Embers | The Lighthouse
 east of Porthtrunnel has a | |
 | flame burning at the top
 floor, but some | | | baddies
 have messed the flame up. By
 using | | | these embers, you
 can turn it back to normal. | |
 | The embers are found in the
 Lighthouse itself. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Treasure Map | A special map
 given to you by an old, | | |
 preaching man in Mintos Town.
 The map has a | | | huge, red
 "X" on it. At this spot, a | |
 | legendaric treasure is
 hidden. You can't | | | reach
 this treasure before getting
 the Air |
 |                          | Ba
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Feverfew Seed / Root | The
 Feverfew plant can cure pretty
 much all | | | kinds of
 sickness, including the one
 that | | | Kiryl gets in Mintos
 Town. The seed is found | | |
 in the Icy Cave south of
 Parthenia, and the | | | root
 is given to you by the king of
 Parthenia, | | | once you have
 the seed over to him. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Magic Key | Similar to the
 Thief's Key, but this one | | |
 opens all RED doors instead of
 BLUE ones. | | | It once
 belonged to Meena and Maya's
 papa, | | | who stored it in
 his secret lab before he | | |
 went on to the afterlife. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Magma Staff | You're going to
 need this in order to open the
 | | | secret passage that leads
 into the Femiscyra | | |
 Kingdom. Found in Zamoksva
 castle after | | | slaying the
 monstrous Balzack. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Bronze Rosary | A personal
 treasure belonging to a nun
 living | | | in Femiscyra. When
 someone steals it, your | | |
 party is blamed for the theft.
 |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Ultimate Key | A key that you
 get from the Queen of | | |
 Femiscyra. It'll open all kinds
 of metal |
 |                          | ga
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Karstaway Stone | A stone
 that can suck up water! You'll
 need it | | | to enter one of
 the dungeons! Found in |
 |                          | Du
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Mod Rod | This is a rod found
 in the Royal Crypt. It | | |
 allows you to turn your own
 party members | | | into a wide
 range of creatures, such as | |
 | monsters, old women and
 priests. Useful for | | |
 gaining information, or just
 avoiding | | | being attacked
 by monsters, such as in Dire |
 | | Palace, where lots of them
 live. |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Gas Canister | The gas
 canister is the only part that
 is | | | missing from the
 flying balloon that a man | | |
 living in Riverton is
 inventing. After finding | | |
 the Canister after the battle
 with Estark, | | | make sure to
 bring it to the man in
 Riverton. | | | He'll give the
 flying balloon to you! With it,
 | | | you can travel EVERYWHERE
 on the world map! |
 |                          |   
 +--------------------------+---
 | Baron's Bugle | You can use
 this bugle to summon your horse
 | | | wagon (Mary Lou). The
 only time it's really | | |
 useful is in the volcano where
 you encounter | | | Psaro after
 Death Castle. Use it right
 before | | | starting the
 battle with him, in order to |
 | | summon your entire party.
 If you don't do | | | this, you
 won't be able to change your
 battle | | | lineup during this
 important battle. |

       CREDITS & SALUTATIONS
       [ow001]

================================

 Can't write something this big
 without including some credits
 and salutations. That would
 have been crazy! At least I
 think so, because I could never
 have done this without some..
 creative input. If that's the
 right thing to call it. It is,
 in a way, I guess, on several
 levels. Anyway, I would like to
 thank Square-Enix for
 publishing the Nintendo DS
 version of Dragon Quest IV.
 Having it on a handheld system
 is really nice! I dreamt of
 having it in this form a couple
 of years ago. So, thank you for
 making at least one dream come
 true!

 Then there's the music I've
 been listening to while
 writing. And you know, that's
 quite a lot of music. The
 highlights are anything by Asai
 Kenichi -- particularly his
 most creative project,
 SHERBETS. Then there's LOVE
 PSYCHEDELICO, The Cro-Magnons,
 Motörhead and THE HIGH-LOWS.
 Oh, and The Birthday! Really
 nice music, all of those bands.

 Next comes you, the reader,
 for.. reading this ^^ I know
 for sure I would never ever
 even thought of writing a guide
 if there weren't any readers.
 That's why you deserve a big
 "thank you". This is great for
 practicing my skills with the
 English language, and gives me
 a good excuse to play the games
 I love a lot! Thaaank you! If I
 receive some submissions, I'll
 list the nicknames of everyone
 just below this paragraph!
 Thanks to...

 ~ Me! I think I'm about to
 reach a total of 5000kb of
 submitted FAQs. Never
   thought that would happen :O

 ~ JF Tanguay for being a great
 help in covering the post-
 adventure content,
   and the extra dungeon in
   particular. You wouldn't be
   able to read the section
   covering this dungeon if it
   wasn't for him. Fabulous
   work, JF!

 ~ sneakypanda for telling me
 about a spelling error. I had
 originally listed
   the Night Light item as
   obtainable in Chapter III,
   instead of Chapter IV, which
   is what it SHOULD have said,
   and now does. Thankies :)

 ~ kaskala knew about a couple
 of items hidden left of the
 Mamon Mine entrance,
   in a tiny, tiny building
   that's just standing there
   rotting. The items have been
   mentioned in the main
   walkthrough, and of course
   included in the item
   checklists. Thank you very
   much!

 ~ Tengah found 50 Coins on the
 ground, just before Alena teams
 up with Kiryl
   and Borya. Now you can find
   them too, by reading the
   walkthrough (:

 ~ leviathankyou and Ryuo both
 noticed I had written that one
 of the chests at
   the end of Chapter I
   contained a Seed of Luck,
   when in reality, there is a
   Seed of Resilience inside.
   Appreciated!

 ~ Darkniciad realized it's
 possible to get a lot of
 Yggdrasil Leafs, by
   fooling the game when you're
   climbing the World Tree
   Yggdrasil. Added a note about
   this to the main walkthrough.

 ~ ignasia7 and others at
 GameFAQs for working on and
 posting a spell list.

 ~ Zero, for reminding me about
 Torneko's optional bodyguards.
 Very glad you
   noticed there weren't
   mentioned. Now they are.

 ~ Hohenheim_1 sent me a great
 mail, correcting a couple of
 errors I had made
   when writing about character
   stats, and gave me detailed
   information regarding Meena's
   Silver Tarot Cards. Very
   grateful -- thankies!!

 ~ Brad Dittmar provided insight
 on several areas, such as
 information on
   stats, name changes, and the
   English language, which isn't
   my strongest side. Great
   stuff :)

 ~ Patrick L. found a Seed of
 Resilience I had missed back in
 good old Mintos.

 ~ Garrett M. helped me out with
 some information missing from
 the equipment
   lists. Lifesaver! :)

 ~ I had forgotten to mention
 two mini-medals, but abcd9146
 reminded me about
   them, so now that's not a
   problem anymore!

        CONTACT ME [ow002]

================================

 Hi!

 If you want to tell me
 something, this is where you
 can find out how to do that.
 For example, if you know of
 something that I haven't
 included in the guide, I'd love
 it if you told me about it so
 that we could make the guide
 even better than it's current
 form. And that's only possible
 if I get some help from you.
 Credit will of course be given
 to anyone who submits something
 that ends up here! And please,
 if you don't have any
 information to submit, please
 send me a mail or add my
 messenger. I love seeing who's
 been using the guide, and what
 you think of it -- just a few
 words is more than fine if you
 don't like writing walls of
 text (:

 I hope you've enjoyed reading,
 and found the guide at least a
 little useful. That's what I
 aimed for when I started
 writing it, after all. Until
 next time then -- I'm not
 finished writing these things
 yet. I think. And hope. Bye
 now!

        VERSION HISTORY [ow004]

================================

 Version 0.0 - 2008/07/01
 ------------------------
 Started writing today, and came
 up with the idea that actually
 seeing when I began this thing
 would be interesting in the
 future. To be honest, I've done
 the same thing countless times
 in the past, but here we go..
 1st of July!

 Version 0.1 - 2008/07/07
 ------------------------
 I haven't had too much time to
 work on this, but I've managed
 to cover the storyline up 'til
 Torneko's chapter. That's not
 too bad. Still miles away from
 releasing this on the Internet
 though, so I'm still in my
 "write version history simply
 for my own sake" phase.
 Strange, am I not?

 Version 0.2 - 2008/07/10
 ------------------------
 Henshin-a-go-go! Today I've
 worked a lot on the main
 walkthrough, and ended up
 finishing Chapter IV -- the
 dancing sisters are safe now.
 What? What am I talking about?
 Play the game and you'll see!
 By the time I reach Version 0.3
 of the guide, the main
 walkthrough should be finished,
 but there's still tons upon
 tons of work left. Lists of
 items, information about the
 casino and so on is going to
 take me more time than I'm
 comfortable with. But of
 course, I can't go around
 feeling all comfortable all the
 time.

 Version 0.25 - 2008/08/15
 -------------------------
 Still not done with the main
 walkthrough (I've reached
 Estark's awakening), but I feel
 like I need to make a point
 today, since I've been on
 vacation, returned from there,
 and started working more on the
 guide again after coming back.
 Also, normal life (?) starts
 again in a couple of days, so I
 won't be able to do huge
 workloads whenever I want to
 from now on. Anyway, I've added
 a lot of stuff, such as a
 diagram with descriptions on
 important storyline items, I've
 started a Spells/Skills
 section, and I've started work
 on a couple of other diagrams
 as well. Most of the work has
 been put into the main
 walkthrough though, and I think
 it's coming together rather
 nicely. Let's have a soda to
 celebrate that ^^. It won't be
 long before at least the main
 walkthrough is posted online.
 If I can just... wrap up some
 smaller details ^^

 Version 0.3 - 2008/09/17
 ------------------------
 Too much work! Way too little
 energy left to work with the
 guide. I haven't made much
 progress since last time at
 all. I think I'll mainly
 concentrate on the main
 walkthrough now, and leave all
 the lists out for later. I'm at
 the four barriers in Heaven's
 Haven, by the way. Another
 thing I want to address is the
 Mini Medals. Right now, the
 guide doesn't contain the
 locations of them all. I'll
 look at that later on. Right
 now, the guide is far from
 finished, and should not be
 considered a full guide, but I
 figured I'd post it online.
 Feedback, suggestions, or
 anything else is welcome :)

 Version 0.35 - 2008/09/19
 -------------------------
 Finished the main walkthrough
 for Chapter V, fixed a few
 typos. Oh, and added some items
 I had missed to the main
 walkthrough (don't get your
 hopes up for item
 lists/diagrams outside of the
 main walkthrough yet, though).
 But, there's probably tons of
 them spelling errors still
 left, hahah ^^

 Version 0.36 - 2008/09/21
 -------------------------
 Some real minor stuff. Spell-
 checked the whole document, and
 completed the Mini Medal
 Rewards section. Started
 working on
 weapons/items/accessories
 diagrams, but they're not
 included here yet.

 Version 0.37 - 2008/09/24
 -------------------------
 Included some item and
 equipment lists.

 Version 0.38 - 2008/09/28
 -------------------------
 Making slow progress. I've
 changed some character stat
 descriptions, added information
 about Meena's Silver Tarot Card
 skills, and corrected some
 things in the main walkthrough;
 among other things, some seeds
 of magic were listed as seeds
 of resilience. I've
 unfortunately got a lot of
 stuff to do, and the guide
 doesn't get first priority.
 Anyway, slow progress is at
 least some kind of progress.
 See you around =)

 Version 0.40 - 2008/12/13
 -------------------------
 Added Foo Yung and Chow Mein's
 Dungeon to the walkthrough. I
 don't have the names for the
 items found in this dungeon
 yet, so if anyone wants to help
 with getting me those, it would
 be great. Send me a mail or
 something if you'd like to help
 :)

 Version 0.50 - 2008/12/19
 -------------------------
 Yet another update. Figured I'd
 full-circle the game on
 GameFAQs now, as it covers the
 whole main game. While Foo Yung
 and Chow Mein's dungeon has
 been covered, there's still
 some optional stuff left to
 write about. What I'm thinking
 about is of course Aamon and
 the Pioneer Town.

 Version 0.51 - 2009/01/04
 -------------------------
 Minor update with some
 contributed information added.

 Version 0.52 - 2009/01/24
 -------------------------
 School is killing me! I want to
 get this guide 100% completed,
 but tests, homework, and all
 kinds of other stuff is making
 this task harder than what I'm
 comfortable with! Anyways,
 we're getting closer and
 closer, now. Thanks to some
 contributors, all of the mini
 medals in the main game
 (excluding Boom Town) are
 included in the guide. Also did
 a big update to the item lists.
