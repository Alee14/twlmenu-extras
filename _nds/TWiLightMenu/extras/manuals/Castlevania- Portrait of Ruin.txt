INTRODUCTION--------------------
--------------------------------
Hello I'm Matthew Fletcher,
though you can call me Shintaun.
I loved this game so much that I
had to write a walkthrough for
it. It's as spoiler free as you
can get while still listing boss
names. I hope you enjoy this
walkthrough and have a great day
playing this game too.

This guide uses the search
function for quick and easy
access. Ctrl+F is how most
browsers have it set up. Use the
last 6 characters of a line.
Example (ABCD). Only for a
section provided.

In this walkthrough I will guide
you to all items/breakable walls
and such as early as you can
reach them. When I list items I
mean list the found ones found
on the ground. I will also list
every monster in every room
once. Sorry if it get's annoying
seeing those same words over and
over.

Because I do not have a
Beastiary nor a Quest Section up
as I am currently in need of a
break from this walkthrough,
I'll provide you links to
current ones. I take no credit
for the information in these
guides and I'll list the
username of the people who
submitted them. But I suggest
you use them until I get my
sections up.

out Boss strategies even more.
Frequently Asked Questions

Section Items and Equipment
Critical Arts Figuring out which
items are in each area. That I
forgot to mention at the item
list of each section. >.>;;

If you need to contact me you
can email me at
shintaun@yahoo.com I'm also a
regular at the Castlevania:
Portrait of Ruin boards at
gamefaqs. You'll probably get a
quicker responce there. Just put
my name in the title and your
sure to catch my attention soon.

--------------------------------
TIPS AND GENERAL INFORMATION----
--------------------------------
----(TIPS)
--------------------------------
Candles and other breakable
lights. If you use up any mp
they are guranteed to give you
Hearts to restore it. However if
your full on mp and you break
one it will give you gold. In
1,10,50,100 increments. If you
get a gold ring those increments
change to 10,50,100,500 or
50,100,500,1000 for two gold
rings.


Johnathan's Sub Weapons. He
get's many ranging from the
tried and true Holy Water to
even a Pie! The more you use any
Sub Weapon the stronger it gets.
But to be more precise. If you
kill an enemy that you hit with
a Sub Weapon, you will get the
number of sp that the enemy is
worth added to your Sub Weapon.

When you get the maximum amount
of sp for a Sub Weapon you will
see in Blue Text MASTERED on the
screen. Mastery changes them in
various ways. To know if your
Sub Weapon is already mastered
or the amount of sp needed to
master it. Pause the game. Go
into Guides. Go into Skills.

Charlotte's Spells. She get's
anything ranging from healing
and stat boosts to destructive
spells. She has two levels of
casting. Half and Full.

Half casting generally get's you
much less power and shorter
duration as well. When you
summon Charlotte by pressing R
she will only do Half casting.
Likewise if you start to cast a
spell and let go of Y before the
Glowing Red Bar is fully filled
you will only half cast.

Full Casting get's the full
effect of any spell. You know
the spell is fully cast when the
Glowing Red bar is completely
filled before letting go of Y.
She will also shout the spells
name. In other words hold down Y
until you have a glowing red bar
to do a fully cast spell.

A special note on stat boosting
spells. If you fully cast with
Charlotte and summon Johnathon
with A before switching to
Johnathan. You will get the full
effect for Johnathan! At this
point you can dismiss Charlotte
by pressing A and still retain
the effects of the spell.

I'll put in (?) after the name
of every important monster. The
? is replaced by the following
and means. Subweapon=SW,
Spell=S, Quest Item=QI. Rare
Monster=RM, Great Drop=GD Mid
Boss=MB, Boss=B, Undead=UD, Dual
Crush=DC, Relic=R

All Mid Bosses are replaced with
normal monsters after you kill
them. The first time you come
across a monster I will tell you
the Subweapon or what not that
it drops. But only the first
time.

All Sub Weapons and Spells are
quest items despite being listed
as what they are.

Only the Bosses in the Nest of
Evil can be fought multiple
times.

You can only kill those with the
undead class using Johnathon's
Undead Killer Whip or
Charlotte's Sanctuary Spell.

Never sell a quest item. Some of
them you can't get back without
doing either clear game or
online shopping.

Rare Monsters only appear under
certain conditions. I list these
the first time you can see them.

Great Drops are drops I
recommend getting.

I think I covered everything
important for now.

--------------------------------
Entering the Castle-------------
--------------------------------
-----(ENTR)
--------------------------------
Enemies: Zombie, Bat,
Skeleton(S), Axe Armor(SW),
Wight(RM)

Items: Change Cube(R), Call
Cube(R), Tome of Arms 1, Short
Sword, Beef Jerkyx2, Knife(SW),
Wait Cube(R), Raging Fire(S),
Book of Spirits(R), Head Guard

After the starting Dialogue exit
the room to the right.

Welcome to the Castle Entrance.
And what castle entrance
wouldn't be complete without
it's very own Drawbridge? Drop
down and head to the right to
grab the floating blue cube,
aptly named Change Cube. These
are your Relics. They let you do
more things. This one for
example allows you to switch
characters by pressing X.

After that's done go right and
jump up the platforms and jump
left to grab the second Relic.
This is the Call Cube. Press A
so that the weight of you and
your partner cause the switch to
lower the drawbridge.

Head right and you'll enter the
castle courtyard where you fight
two Zombies. Exit to the right
and you'll enter a really small
room. Exit to the right once
more.

First room of the castle and you
only can kill two zombies and a
single bat here. Oh well go
right and drop down to grab Tome
of Arms 1 and head left to grab
a Short Sword. Both are better
than your current weapons so
equip them. From here on I'll
assume your checking new gear
and putting it on as you see
fit. Go left and drop down.
Attack the wall on your left. A
Beef Jerky should fall out. Exit
to the right.

This is a Save room. They will
show up on your map as red dots.
You can save at any statue with
a Blue Aura. They will also
refill your Hp and Mp free of
charge. You can get a refill
without saving by saying no when
prompted to save. Exiting and
reentering the room will cause
the Aura to return so no worries
about limited use. Exit to the
left.

Head back up and this time exit
to the top right of the room.
You can break a pillar where the
cracks are, by attacking it
three times. After you pass
through a couple pillars, a
Behemoth starts to chase you.
Don't fight! As there is nothing
you can do to win. Quickly break
through the pillars and head
right. You will reach a dead
end. Jump up and grab the Beef
Jerky and stay there until the
Behemoth breaks the wall to the
right and leaves. Note after
this there will be one Axe Armor
and respawning Zombies in this
room. If you kill all the
Zombies a Wight will appear!
Exit right.

You get your first Sub Weapon,
the Knife. When you use it. You
throw two knives in the
direction your facing. To the
right is another save room if
you need it. Jump up and exit to
the left. In here you fight two
Skeletons. These can drop the
Summon Skeleton spell for
Charlotte. Exit to the left.

Go left and jump up onto the
statue to grab the Wait Cube.
Hold down and press a. Then jump
off and push the statue to the
left until you partner can jump
without smashing their head into
the ceiling. Press X to switch
to your partner and jump up. Go
right and obtain Charlotte's
first spell Raging Fire. First,
unless the Skeleton's dropped
their spell for you. Exit left.

This room has two Skeletons and
an Axe Armor. Axe Armor drops
the Axe sub weapon for
Johnathon. It's useful for
taking out flying enemies. Exit
left. When you enter the room
immediately jump up and into the
next room. There is one Axe
Armor here. Grab the Book of
Spirits and jump back down into
the previous room.

Head left to grab the Head Guard
and then exit to the left. This
is a Warp Room. These will be
invaluable in helping you get
around different areas. Return
to the previous room and take
the bottom right exit. A Talk
Scene will occur here. This is
Wind. He will give you quests.
Accept his quest and then head
right into the next room.

Another talk scene will occur
here. This is Vincent your shop
guy. I recommend buying a map
and the Shuriken Sub Weapon for
Johnathon. Feel free to buy
another potion if you feel you
need it. The Shuriken is one of
the best sub weapons in the
entire game. If you throw it
while in the air and at the
right distance you can get both
shurikens to hit the same enemy.
Once mastered you throw four! I
won't give anymore shop
recommendations at this point. I
do suggest that you prioritize
spells and sub weapons on your
shopping list though.

Go back to Wind and he will give
you the Lizard Tail Relic. After
another talk scene exit left.
Head down and left and jump on
the switch to allow you to go to
the area below. Go to the ledge
just above you and head left.
Slide through the gap and enter
the room on the left. There will
be dialogue here. After the
dialogue enter the portrait.

My Map Percentage was 8.4% for
the Castle. In the menu go to
maps to see the % completion you
have for each.

right. Here you'll fight two Axe

Bakery. Grab the Paper Airplane

hit the Chandelier above it.

Depending on the amount dropped
into the register you'll get a
different item. You can get
Sachertorte, NY Cheesecake,
Mille-feville, Wheat Roll. All
in rising coin order. You can't
get the other two until later.
I'll tell you when. Any time you
don't have any of a type of
baked good that appears here it
will pop into existence. For now
return to the previous room and
exit up. Exit right. Pick up the
Rush Dual Crush. This is your
first Dual Crush. Dual Crushes
take a LOT of mp and have a cool
down time. So even if you had
enough mp to cast it twice you
have to wait for the cool down.
Most Dual Crushes also provide
invulnerability time during
them.

Claymore. Exit right. Here
you'll fight an Axe Armor. Head

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Dullahan------------
--------------------------------
-----(DULL)
--------------------------------
Dullahan
Hp: 600 Exp: 500 Sp: 40
Weak: Blunt, Whip, Lightning
Srong: Ice

Attacks Lunge: He will thrust
his Lance forward. If your on a
top ledge he will thrust it at
you. You can dodge this easily
by not moving if your on the
ground, unless he's really close
and walks into you. Or in the
case of the top ledge, running
away. It's also his opening
move.

Plunge: He jumps forward into
the air and thrusts his lance
into the ground. This will
create a shockwave of blades
that move forward. You can dodge
this by sliding under him if
your close enough. If your not
jump up on the ledge and jump up
to the next ledge as he lands.
After this move he is stuck for
a little while so kick him while
he's down! Note: On hard he
doesn't really get stuck. xD

Homing Head: He will put his
head on and launch big
projectiles at you that hurt a
lot and go where you were at the
start of the move. You can dodge
these easily by moving away from
where you were at the start of
each attack. Can be prevented by
knocking his head out of the way
when he goes to grab for it.
This is almost impossible in
most cases unless your using an
overhead swinging weapon, Rock
Riot spell or the Axe sub
weapon.

Spinning Head: He will throw his
head and shoot little
projectiles in all directions
which also hurt a lot. Move far
away when he goes to throw
crouching in a corner always
keeps me safe. You can also hit
the heads away. Only occurs when
Dullahan manages to do Homing
Head. Note: On hard he will
launch big projectiles that
spiral sortof outwords at the
same time as this move. I'll
leave judging the distance up to
you. But your pretty much going
to have to crouch and attack the
spinning heads away once you
notice which spot is safe.If
your still having problems you
can use a Dual Crush for limited
Inulnerability when this move
comes up.

Strategies Johnathon should use
Shurikens for some quick damage
while keeping enough mp just in
case you need to use a Dual
Crush for Invulnerability. Jump
attacking with an overhead swing
weapon is a great way to keep
Dullahan from grabbing his head
and for dealing damage.

Charlotte should use the Rock
Riot spell to cause great damage
and keep Dullahan from grabbing
his head.

The Holy Lightning Dual Crush
will do a decent amount of
damage to Dullahan but is best
saved for if he Grabs his head
so that you can damage him
safely without getting hurt.

City of Haze.

--------------------------------
Castle After Haze---------------
--------------------------------
-----(CAZE)
--------------------------------
Enemies: Golem, Skull Archer,
Bat, Une, Zombie Dragon(MB),
Merman, Frozen Shade, Slime,
Invisible Man, Skelerang(SW),
Persephone, Larva, Catoblepas,
Lerajie(SW), Mimic, Great Armor,
Behemoth(B), Keremet(B)

Items: Whip Skill 1(R), Combat
Knife, Offensive Form(SW), Hp
Max Up, Boiled Starfish, Potion,
Ice Fang(S), Don Quixote, Stone
of Flight(R), Partisan, Goggles,
Axe Bomber(DC), Iron Leggings,
Bathrobe, Nun's Habit

Accept the Supersonic Punch
Quest. Go back to the City of
Haze and head to the Butchery.
If you don't remember where it's
at. Just head to the left most
room that's 3 squares higher on
the map, than your starting
point. In this room you should
see hanging sacks of meat.
Unequip your weapon on Johnathon
and punch the hanging meat.
Ground Meat should fall out.
Return to Wind at this point. He
will give you the Bullet Punch.
A fairly good fist weapon that
strikes twice per attack. It's
quite useful so don't sell it.

Head to the room just before the
right most save room on your
map. It should be just after the
room where the Behemoth chased
you. Just a note this is where I
start counting the enemies
again. Jump off your partner's
shoulders to grab the Whip Skill
1 Relic and then exit right
twice. Pick up the Spear and
then enter the Boos Door to the
right.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Behemoth------------
--------------------------------
-----(BEHE)
--------------------------------
Behemoth
Hp: 800 Exp: 1000 Sp: 45
Weak: Piercing, Fire, Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Charge: This attack has
two variants. In the first one
he shows he's going to charge by
puffing a bit of steam and
slides his foot along the ground
twice just prior to charging off
screen. Dodge this by jumping up
onto a platform and then jumping
over him as he runs by. The
second version is where he
slides a leg back and then leaps
forward before charging off
screen. Dodge this by running
forward and sliding under him.
After a little while he will
charge back on screen and stop
about in the middle of the room.

Intestinal strike: In this
attack he opens hi mouth and his
intestines rush forward to hit
you. You can dodge this by
either running away if there is
a decent space towards the wall
or by crouching next to the
wall.

Puke: He tilts his head upwards
and pukes at you. You can dodge
this by ducking in the corner or
being very close to him.

Strategies Johnathon's Shurikens
are a great way to rack up
damage. Darts are another nice
choice since you can keep a
distance from the Behemoth while
hurting him. A simple short hop
will net you a bulls-eye. A note
about the darts. They are
actually doing more damage than
they show if your getting bulls-
eyes.

Charlotte's Ice Needle is the
best spell you can use on him.
Rock Riot can do similar damage.
But is a bit unsafe in
comparrisson.

Other than that just attack him.
A great weapon is the Spear you
find outside of the Boos Room.
Because it has great reach and
is piercing.

Boss Battle:Keremet-------------
--------------------------------
-----(KERE)
--------------------------------
Keremet
Hp: 666 Exp: 2000 Sp: 50
Weak: Fire, Ice, Lightning
Strong: None

In order to make this Boss come
out you have to attack the pot
several times.

Attacks Dark Orb: He opens his
mouth and a Magic Symbol appears
before a big red and black orb
flies out in a straight line. If
you hit it several glowing
skulls will rain down causing
big damage. You can avoid this
by not jumping into it. Note: On
Hard he can cause the Skull Rain
on his own.

Goo Shedding: When he is up he's
constantly shedding blobs. These
will Crawl along the ground to
the pot. You can dodge these by
jumping over them or destroy
them outright with any attack.

Strategies Push the pot over to
a ledge. Put Ice Fang on
Charlotte and have Johnathon
attack the pot.(preferably with
Bullet Punch) Have Charlotte
stand on the first ledge and
spam Ice Fang for a very easy
win. I did 70 damage three times
per cast. Another strategy is to
equip your strongest weapon on
Johnathon and jump up and attack
while Charlotte attacks the pot
non stop. His Axe Sub weapon
will hit twice as well. All in
all this way is much less
effective than using Charlotte.
And you have to stop from time
to time to avoid breaking the
Dark Orbs.

-----(ASTA)
--------------------------------
Astarte Hp: 1500 Exp: 3000 Sp:
50 Weak: blunt, Whip, Piercing
Strong: Fire, Ice, Lightning,
Dark, Holy

Attacks Charm: She'll say
Temptation and Hearts will fly
out of her at you. If Johnathon
is out he will be Charmed. At
this point Johnathon will attack
you using whatever you had on
him when he got charmed. Meaning
you can't take off his gear to
make him less lethal once it's
happened. To dodge this simply
take Johnathon off of the screen
by switching to Charlotte. If
Johnathon gets charmed you can
use a Dual Crush to get him
back. Note: If you beat this
Boss while Johnathon is Charmed
you will get to hear Charlotte
make fun of Johnathon. Well
sortof.

Tornado: She will pull out what
a gold rod and a Tornado will
fly out of it at you. You can
dodge this by jumping over it.

Thrust: She slides forward and
throws he veil at you to cause
damage. You can dodge this by
Jumping up or running away.

Green Orb: She pulls out a staff
and jumps up and back spraying
green orbs at an angle. To dodge
this either get behind her or
run away.

Strategies 1000 Blades is easily
the most destructive thing you
can do against her almost
killing her outright!
Johnathon's Bullet punch can do
quite a number on her with 20
damage per hit and striking in
rapid succession. Back dash
canceling his Dart sub weapon
can work nicely and keep you at
a safe distance. His Shurikens
can devastate with about 41
damage per hit on a Mastered
Shuriken. So that's 164 damage
per throw if you can get all 4
Shurikens to hit! Charlotte's
Rock Riot and Summon Skeleton
can do about 38 with each hit at
this point.

Boss Battle:Legion--------------
--------------------------------
-----(LEGI)
--------------------------------
Legion
Hp: 2000 Exp: 4000 Sp: 50
Weak: Piercing, Fire, Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Shedding: Legion will
let several corpses fall. These
corpses will walk in one
direction when they land. Any
attack will instantly kill them
and they will go away if they
touch the wall as well.

Peek-A-Boo Beam: After killing
off a section of Legions body a
tentacle will be exposed. It
will open the end of the
tentacle closest to you and fire
a beam in a small sweeping
motion. You can easily avoid
this by moving out of it's small
sweeping range.

Spinning Beam: Four of Legions
tentacles will open and then go
in a constant beam as he spins.
You can avoid this by jumping
through the tentacles as they
spin or by running away from the
beam. Legion will reverse the
spin about halfway through.

Spread Beam: All tentacles will
open at slightly different
intervals and then fire in the
order opened. You can avoid this
by not being in their way. Where
they fire is fixed with this
attack.

Note: When you deal enough
damage to Legions Core all of
his corpse sections will fall
off.

Strategy Johnathon's Bible,
Javelin and Axe are great ways
to peel off Legions body.
Shuriken is the best Subweapon
to use after the body is peeled
off.

Charlotte's Ice Fang is hands
down the best way to peel off
Legions body at this point. When
the Body is peeled away Summon
Gunman will be the best spell to
use. Ice Fang comes in at a
close second.

After the body sections are
peeled away 1000 Blades is hands
down the quickest and most
effective way to kill Legion.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Stella--------------
--------------------------------
-----(STEL)
--------------------------------
Stella Hp: 2500 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire,
Lightning Strong: Ice

Attacks Thrust: She thrusts at
you with her sword. She does
this either in an upper cut
fashion if you go over her or by
thrusting forward. You can avoid
this by going away from her or
even by ducking. Though she
tends to do this more when your
in the air.

Secret Furious Wave: She will go
to the ground and then scream
the name of the attack before
attacking forward that causes a
huge green wave to rush forward.
You can dodge this simply by
jumping over it.

Dodge: Whenever she just
finished an attack she will
dodge any Sub Weapon. But only
once per attack cycle because
she immediately goes into an
attack after Dodging.

Hurrican Slash: In the middle of
the air she will yell Hurricane
or There and then strike
downward. This will send out a
green wave in the middle of the
air forward. Usually it's best
to jump over it.

Crescent Moon: She will slash in
several places in the air
leaving little moons in place.
They will start spinning towards
you in the order they were
created and will go to where you
were at the start of their spin.
You can easily avoid them by
moving out of the way. No homing
here. She will perform other
attacks as the moons fly at you.

Strategy Charlotte Tempest is
hands down the best non Dual
Crush to take her down. It will
hit for 6 times if you do it
right. Which is generally
letting off Tempest as Stella
does her Furious Wave. She will
Dodge but it always goes into
the Tempest from my experience.
Another great spell is Summon
Gunman since Stella is almost
guaranteed to do her Furious
Wave attack if your on the
ground. Most of Charlottes other
spells are dodged like mad by
Stella so are pretty worthless.

Johnathon Nebula's special
really racks up damage on Stella
however it can be somewhat
annoying to set it up. Attacking
with a strong weapon like Long
Spear will generally do more
damage over time. Shurikens are
realistically the only Sub
Weapon I'd recommend for this
fight.

Dual Crushes I'd only recommend
Holy Lightning here it does a
ton of damage. Combined with
Tempest during the cool down
time of the Dual Crush this is
the best way to kill her.

your mp before or after talking
to him again. You should of
completed 5 quests now. Unless
you were fortunate enough to
have 777 as the final part of
your gold. Return to the Nation
of fools at this point. Go to
the bottom left room.

All the way to the left is a
statue. Press up at it. You
should see quest successful. Go
to any candles you desire at
this point and make the final 3
digits of your gold 777.
Remember the gold values Blue=1
gold, Brown=10 gold, Silver=50
gold, and Yellow=100 gold. You
can also sell some items if
you'd like. Just don't sell any
of the quest items. When that's
done talk to Wind again. You
should only have the Poison vs
Poison quest remaining at this
point. Return to where you
fought Stella. Exit left.

There will be some dialogue here
and your cog will get used. Exit
left. Here is a simple task. You
should have the person on the
top motorcycle at the far left
at all times for the final
part.Have your partner stay on
the top motorcycle as you go up
onto the bottom. Immediately
start ducking. After you pass
the obstacle that you were to
duck under switch to your
partner and duck with them. When
you switch to the top for the
section time be prepared to jump
over an obstacle and land on the
other side on your motorcycle
again. Immediately duck again.
Doing this correctly will cause
the motorcycles to destroy the
wall.

Break the ceiling in the center
of this room. Exit up. Here
you'll fight six Skeleton
Gunmen. Grab the Slick Boots.
Exit down. Exit left. Here
you'll fight an Imp. Exit left.
Ride up the water system and

door area. Enter it. Grab the

Right underneath that is a Save
room. Exit up. Here you'll fight
a Crossbow Armor and a Killer
Doll.

Grab the Taunt Sub Weapon. Exit

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Dagon---------------
--------------------------------
-----(DAGO)
--------------------------------
Dagon Hp: 1800 Exp: 6000 Sp: 55
Weak: Lightning, Holy Strong:
Ice, Dark Note: Only way to hurt
him is to hit the top head.

Attacks Leap: Simply put he
leaps to the other side. You can
stand in the middle and not get
hurt.

Floating Explosives: Dagon will
release multiple explosives that
float to the waters surface.
When he sucks in the water they
will attach to the ground. You
destroy these by doing enough
damage to them. If you touch
them they blow up for decent
damage.

Water Cannon: Dagon will suck up
all the water in the room. He
will then launch it back at you
in the form of a Water Cannon.
You can avoid this by Dark Rift
and Clear Skies will last more
than his entire Water Cannon
sequence. Or you can use Tempest
as the Water Cannon is about to
hit you. I advise ducking
because Tempest doesn't last
long.

Strategies Charlotte: Use
Tempest where he's going to land
when he does Leap and Rock Riot
when he's just sitting there.
The only other thing she could
really do when not Negating the
Water Cannon is a Str Boost for
Johnathon.

Johnathon: If you picked up a
Heaven's Sword from the Nation
of Fools then your in luck. This
is the easiest way to kill Dagon
especially if you have Charlotte
cast Str Boost. Second easiest
way is to use Javelin. Just jump
and throw. You should be able to
manage three hits per Javelin.
Shuriken would be a better
choice except you can't land all
four hits as often due to Dagon
sucking up the water time and
time again. You have to be
swimming close to Dagons Head to
actually have all four hit.

Dual Crushes: Holy Lightning
does a real number on Dagon.
Combine that with Heaven's Sword
during the cool downs. You'll
have the best way to take him
down at this point.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After beating Dagon, exit right.
Grab the Toad Morph and exit
right. Warp to the start and
return to the Castle.

My Map Percentage was 99.2% for

Exit right. Exit bottom left.
Here you'll fight a Harpy. Exit

get through the narrow gap and
grab two 2000 Gold Bags. Exit
right three times. Ride the
water system up to the next door
and exit right three times. Here
you'll fight two Razor Bats and
a Succubus. Both of Succubus'
drops are great. Exit right.
Here you'll fight three Succubi.
Exit right three times. Jump up
on the platform next to the
right wall. Double Jump and
attack to destroy the wall here.
Enter and grab an Hp Max Up.
Exit left. Exit bottom right.

Step on the switch to cool down
the flames. They will still hurt
you so don't touch them. Return
to Wind now. Unless you haven't
killed 1500 enemies at this
point you should only have The
Gambler quest remaining. If you
picked up the other cards we are
missing Spade and Heart. Return
to the City of Haze now. It's
the portrait just to the left of
Wind. On the right hand side of
the map you should see two very
tall rooms. Go to the right one
and take the top left exit. Use
Toad Morph to get through the
narrow gap and grab the
Milican's Sword.

This brought my map percentage
up to 98.7% for City of Haze.
Now go to Sandy Grave. In case
you forgot which portrait is
Sandy Grave. It's the one on the
far right. Go to the room just
above the Bottom Right room. Use
the Toad Morph to get through
that small gap at the bottom of
the room to get the Sanctuary
spell. Sanctuary allows
Charlotte to kill enemies who
have Red in their name. I had
98.7% map percentage when I left
Sandy Grave. Now return to the
Nation of Fools portrait. In
case you forgot, this Portrait
is just left of the middle of
the map.

Go to the top Warp Room and exit
right four times. You should be
in a two square room with a
narrow path. Use the Toad Morph
to grab the Holy Veil. Return to
Wind for some dialogue. Warp to
the right most Warp room. By
where you fought Stella. Exit
left. Exit top right. Exit
right. Here you'll fight a
Killer Doll. Use Toad Morph to
get through the narrow space.
Exit up. Here you'll fight three
Imps. Exit left. Here you'll
fight respawning Medusa Heads.
Head to the top right corner of
the room to grab the Thunderbolt
Spell.

Head to the top left corner of
the room to grab a Hp Max Up.
Exit left. Here you'll fight a
Gaibon. Attack the wall to the
left for a Mp Max Up. This max
up ties into another one
somewhere. So if one is found
the other vanishes as well.
Research being done on it. Exit
up. Here you'll fight a Slogra.
Exit up. Here you'll fight two
Killer Dolls. Exit left. Here
you'll fight respawning Medusa
Heads and a Flying Armor. Head
left and grab the Rose Stem
Whip. Exit top right. Here
you'll fight three Imps. Exit
top left. Here you'll fight
Slogra and a Gaibon. Head to the
top left corner to grab a Blue
Cape. The middle right exit is
to a Warp Room.

Exit top right. The right room
is a Save Room. If you Value
your game file you will not skip
the following Boss's Dialogue.
It is a common glitch that if
you skip his Dialogue the game
won't count him as beaten and
you will not unlock the quests
that his death flags. And worse
yet if you saved immediately
after taking him down your file
can be permanently ruined in
that you won't be able to
progress at all. With all that
said. Enter to the Boss Room.
There will be some dialogue and
the battle will start.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Death---------------
--------------------------------
--(DEAT)
--------------------------------
Death Hp: 4444 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: N/A Strong: Dark Note:
Don't skip the dialogue after
you beat him or else you'll mess
up your file. He has two types
of forms. His Gray form which he
starts as is weaker to magical
attacks. His White Form is
weaker to physical attacks.

Attacks Strike: Death will
attack horizontally or
vertically depending on where he
is in relation to you. He will
either raise his Scythe over
head or will raise it over his
shoulder as a warnign he's about
to strike. You can dodge them by
jumping over or walking to the
side depending on which way he's
attacking from.

Summon Sickles: Several Sickles
will spawn at random places and
then move slowly towards you.
You can dodge these by jumping
over them or moving to the side
depending on how they approach.
Dark Rift and Anti Air easily
takes care of them. Note:
Depending on his form the
Sickles will be grey or red.

Chain Cage: Death creats a
creates a huge spinning cage of
Chain arms. He then throws his
Scythe which will bounce around.
Use your own discretion when
moving around or jumping over
the Scythe. You can walk through
the Chains with no ill effect.

Ensnare: Death will Summon 4
portals which will launch a
Chain arm from time to time. If
they grab you you will be stuck
and you will have to rely on
your partner to break it in time
before Death causes you massive
damage. You can avoid this
entirely by sending your parnter
into the center via the touch
screen. When Death is about to
strike your partner unsummon
them.

Strategies Charlotte:
Thunderbolt is the best way to
damage his Grey Form. Tempest
and Summon Skeleton come in at a
close second. Casting Str Boost
to help Johnathon during the
White form is advised.

Johnathon: Out of all your Sub
Weapons I'd recommend using only
the Bible or Shurikens on his
White Form. Other than that just
attack with your strongest
weapon or Heaven's Sword.
Johnathon is worthless during
the Grey form.

Dual Crush: I don't recommend
using any Dual Crushes here at
all.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win for the love of
all things sane do not skip the
dialogue! After the dialogue.
Exit left. Hit the glowing
statue thing to activate the
elevator. Exit left. Here you'll
fight two Imps and a Killer
Doll. Grab the Int Boost Spell.
Exit right. Go down all the way
and get into the bottom part of
the elevator. Go up twice and
then walk left. Climb up to grab
the Combat Beret. Drop to the
bottom to grab the Open Veil.
Return to the elevator and go to
the bottom again. Get in the top
elevator and go up once. Exit
left three times. Here you'll
fight two Succubi.

The top left room is a Warp
Room. Grab the Hp Max Up at the
bottom of this room. Exit down.
The room to the right is a Save
Room. Exit left. Here you'll
fight a Wyvern. Exit left twice.
Jump on the switch to blow open
a shorcut. Exit right three
times. Exit up. Exit left. Here
you'll fight four Razor Bats and
2 Malachis. Exit left. Exit up.
Here you'll fight a Dead
Crusader and a Spin Devil. Dead
Crusader drops the Impervious
Mail which has a 50% chance to
negate any attack. It's one of
my favorite armors. The best
protection I've seen it offer
was 14 negates in a row!

Exit right. Here you'll fight a
Spin Devil and two Flame Demons.
Exit right. Here you'll fight a
Wyvern. Exit up. Here you'll
fight a Dead Crusader, a Spin
Devil and a Succubus. Head to
the top left corner and grab the

Here you'll fight two Flame
Demons. Exit left. Here you'll

Ruler's Sword. Exit left. Here
you'll fight a Dead Crusader.
Jump up onto the 2nd left
platform. And break the wall.
Inside is a Mp Max Up. Exit
bottom left. Here you'll fight
two Succubi. Exit right. Exit
top right.

Here you'll fight a Final Guard.
Both of his drops are great. He
drops the Sub Weapon Defensive
Form and the Final Sword. Final
Sword is the physically
strongest overhead swing sword
in the game. The best way to
kill him for his drops is to
first hit him with 1000 Blades.
They throw 50 knives each will
do 1 dmg. However unless your
REALLY CLOSE all 50 won't hit
because when the move ends all
airborne daggers vanish. So
don't be that close and cast
Luck Boost when you finish with
the daggers. 1-3 hits should be
all it takes from here. Exit
right.

The top right room is a Save
Room and the bottom right is a
Warp Room. Exit Down. Here
you'll fight a Dead Crusader.
Exit up. You can exit up for
some dialogue. Exit top left.
Enter the Boss Room. After some
dialogue the fight begins.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Sisters-------------
--------------------------------
-----(SIST)
--------------------------------
Stella Hp: 2500 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire,
Lightning Strong: Ice Note: Dies
if Loretta dies.

Attacks Strike: A simple
overhead strike. As she starts
to swing she flies at you. You
can dodge this simply by moving
in the opposite direction.

Ice Blade: Loretta starts to
spin gathering ice and Stella
moves in front of Loretta.
Loretta then surrounds Stella's
blade in ice. This attack causes
massive damage. Also like her
strike she will move towards
you. The range of her movement
is rather limited and her Ice
Blade shatters on impact with
the ground. So moving away from
her is your best bet. Behind
being the better option.

Loretta Hp: 2500 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire
Strong: Ice Note: Dies if Hp
Stella dies. If you hit her
enough during one of her spells
you'll cancel it.

Attacks Ice Fall: A huge magic
dais appears above Loretta and
huge shards of ice drop down.
Since the ice always falls
directly below dodging is fairly
easy. Just move away from the
dais if you like.

Blizzard: A magic dais appears
in front of Loretta which shoots
several large snow flakes at
you. You can dodge this by going
behind her.

Blizzard Wolves: Like Blizzard
but only does more damage and in
the shape of wolf heads. She
only does this during Critical
Hp and you can dodge it by going
behind her.

Ice Shield: Loretta starts to
spin and gains an aura as an
ENORMOUS ice cube appears. All
it does really is push you
around. You can slide under it
if you'd like. Stella will slice
through the Ice eventually.

Strategies Have Charlotte start
casting Sanctuary immediately
and move Johnathon forward. They
always go after the player
controlled Character. So keep
Charlotte on screen as you keep
the Sisters distracted. What
don't have Sanctuary? Go to
Sandy Grave and in the room one
above the bottom right. Is a
room with a rolling Boulder. Use
Toad Morph to go through the
narrow passage at the bottom of
the room. Killing the Sisters
will result in a Game Over.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win there will be some
dialogue. If you've mastered the
Shuriken you can easily handle
an Optional Boss that you just
got access to. I will list it
now. You access this fight by
leaving the room you beat the
Sisters in and then returning to
it and talking to them. Say your
ready and prepare to fight.
Johnathon will be by himself
here.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Whip's Memory-------
--------------------------------
-----(WHIP)
--------------------------------
Whip's Memory Hp: 5000 Exp: 0
Sp: 0 Weak: Dark Strong: Holy
Note: His attacks hurt A LOT.
Attacks Whip Lash: A simple
attack with the whip. Jump over
it or move away your choice.

Cross: He throws a cross at you.
Jump over it or move away your
choice.

Axe: He will throw an Axe if you
jump over him and he isn't
prepared to do anything else.
Keep moving in a direction while
airborne and it should miss.

Knife: He throws two knives at
you. He uses this as a counter
attack to any Sub Weapon thrown
parallel to the ground. You can
avoid this by jumping over it.

Dash Strike: He jumps up
slightly and back and then zooms
across the ground VERY fast.
Jump over him to avoid it.

Grand Cross: Stay real close to
him for awhile and he will glow
and do this move.

Holy Water: He throws holy water
at you that trails forward. You
can jump over it or run away
your choice. He will only do
this if you hurt him enough.

Strategies Mastered Shuriken is
the best way to go. Chances are
your mp is not going to last
long enough for your Shurikens
to kill him. So you might want
to bring some ethers if that's
all you plan on doing.

The Nebula whip is another great
plan. As it has incredible range
so you can keep your distance.
However the damage leaves
something to be desired. I
prefer Heaven's Sword to it as
you can deal much more damage
due to the Heaven's Sword being
able to hit multiple times. If
you do use this method I advice
you to use the Offensive Form
Sub Weapon for added damage.

Another great method is the
Cream Pie Sub Weapon. It is an
attack that arcs down when
thrown. So you can be a
respectable distance as you
throw it. The fact that it does
Dark damage and costs almost no
mp helps considerably.

And an insanely cheap method.
Equip the Spiked boots to
increase your drop kicking
damage and just drop kick him
like mad. If he pauses for any
reason flee behind him. Because
he's either going to throw an
axe or initiate Grand Cross!
This method is humorous but can
be boring and take awhile. It
probably is most fun when used
to pass time while your mp
restores itself for more
Shurikens.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

If you still can't beat him.
Wait until you either Level up
some more, obtain the Holy Mail
or obtain the Ancient Armor.
Both armors are found later and
I'll remind you about their
usefulness then. If you won,
then congrats. You have the best
whip in the game! Regardless of
whether you win or lose return
to Wind. There will be some
dialogue. However if you won
against the Whip's Memory then
it's dialogue takes priority and
the other one won't happen until
you visit Wind again.

Time for quests again! You
should have only the Build your
power quest complete. Time to
ditch your money! Oh Vincent.
What's this another dialogue?
You can cure him if you want. It
only impacts his appearance and
a few lines in the ending. You
can beat him up and make him run
away crying now. So torture!
Ahem. Get rid of your gold. Once
Abandon Greed is complete. Save
your Game and Yes I'm serious.
Turn off your Ds and change the
game clock. Change your Ds Time
to either 00:00 or 12:00. Turn
the game back on and talk to
Wind.

This should leave Defeat the
Ghoul King, The Gambler and
Build your Strength 2. All other
quests should be done by now if
you've been picking up all the
quest items as I point them out.
Return to the Sisters and Exit
left. You should be in a room
with 5 portraits. Enter the
right most one to Dark Academy.

My Map Percentage was 94.7% for

Up, New York Steak, 2000 gold
bag,

Exit left for a Warp Room. Exit
left twice. Here you'll fight
two Toads, three Mandragoras,
and a Dead Warrior. Dead Warrior
drops Samurai Plate which is one
of the best Armors in the game.
Exit left. Here you'll fight a
Mandragora. Exit left. Here
you'll fight four Toads, two
Alura Une, and two Wakwak Tree.
Wakwak spawns Fleamen. Exit left
twice. Here you'll fight two

Save Room. Exit bottom left.

Crows and a Lightkeeper. Exit
left. Exit Middle Right.

Grab the Owl Morph Spell. Now
that you have this there is no
reason why in any portrait you
can't get 100% map. Exit left.
Exit top right. Here you'll
fight four Black Crows and a
Minotaur. Minotaur drops Bullova
which is the second best axe in
the game and he drops Hercules
Ring. Hercules Ring makes it so
that you don't get stunned when
hit so it's incredibly useful.
Head right and grab the Gold
Plate. Exit left twice. Here
you'll fight a Vapula. Vapula
drops the Hex Spell. This is one
of the best spells in my
opinion. Exit left twice. Use
the Owl Morph to exit up.

Here you'll fight three Imps and
two Old Axe Armors. Old Axe
Armor drops the Ancient Armor
which when worn causes the
wearer to take 10% hp damage
rounded down. So at most you can
survive 10 hits from anything
without curing! This should make
your fight against Whip's Memory
a cakewalk. Exit bottom Left.
Here you'll fight five Ghouls
and a Heavy Armor. Heavy Armor
drops the Wrecking Ball Sub
Weapon and the best Defensive
armor. Sadly the armor comes
with a speed penalty. Head left

for Charlotte's spells. Exit
left. Here you'll fight a
Ruler's Sword. Break the cracked
ceiling and Exit up using Owl
Morph. Grab the Divine Storm
Dual Crush. Exit down. Exit
left.

Here you'll fight three
Dragonflies and a Lesser Demon.
Lesser Demon drops the Skull
ring. Which is the best ring for
raising Int. Only useful during
Mental Training 3 quest. Due to
the curse effect. Get if you
want. Also can be used for the
over coming the curse quest.
Break the edge of the second
platform to get Powdered Milk.

Whip or the upgraded Vampire
Killer's critical art. Now that

Boss Battle:The Creature--------
--------------------------------
-----(CREA)
--------------------------------
The Creature
Hp: 4000 Exp: 5000 Sp: 60
Weak: Whip, Piercing
Strong: Lightning

Attacks Stomp: The Creature
kneels before jumping up and
forward a bit. You can dodge
this by moving either way.

Missile: The Creature's elbow
opens to reveal a missile. This
missile will be launched to
where you were when his elbow
opened. You can dodge this by
Jumping away. Spells like Dark
Rift and Clear Skies negate this
attack. Note: Clear Skies will
just cause the missile to blow
up instantly. If you are within
the blast range you will still
get hurt.

Lightning: The Creature will
extend both of his arms forward
and shoot Lightning wherever you
were standing when he extended
his arms forward. You can avoid
this by moving moving a decent
distance from where you were.
Note: If you were in the air
when he positions his arms he
will shoot it there.

Machine Gun: The Creature's
elbow opens to reveal a Machine
gun. He will do a sweep down and
then back up. You can double
jump over the bullets. Spells
like Dark Rift and Clear Skies
negate this attack. Weapon
attacks can destroy the bullets.
So a whip can make a good shield
too. Holding in the whip lets
the whip fall down as a Shield
and when a bullet would hit your
head just have to tap up and
it's stopped.

Grab: If you are really close he
will move his arm back and then
grab you. After he picks you up
he causes an explosion. You can
avoid this by moving away when
he pulls his arm back.

Strategies Johnathon: Heavens
Sword is a nice choice since it
can hit 3 times per throw if
done right. If you have the
unlocked Vampire Killer it's
critical art does very good
damage. As for sub weapons Holy
Water or Shurikens your best
bet. You'd have to try to not be
able to get all 4 Shurikens to
hit. And Holy water hits
multiple times.

Charlotte: Dark Rift is an
awesome spell especially if your
controlling Johnathon. Since it
sucks in all of The Creatures
Projectiles and can deal decent
damage to The Creature.
Salamander does a great deal of
damage if you could afford to
buy it. Time Stop...This is so
unbelieavably cheap. You cast it
and then use Johnathons Sub
Weapon Bwaka Knife/Boomerang
right next to The Creature. Time
Stop will have the weapon
perpetually stopped and deal
damage at an insane rate. You
can only have one Boomerang out
but you can have three Bwaka
Knives!!! So short hop and pull
them out for insane damage.

Dual Crush: 1000 Blades does an
insane amount of damage. The
best time to start this is as
The Creature starts to do
Machine Gun jump over him and
start. The second best time is
when he jumps. Just move behind
him and let it rip. Sadly this
way you'll probably be hit out
of it but he dies fast enough
anyways.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win Exit right twice
and return to the Castle.

My Map Percentage was 100% for
Dark Academy.

--------------------------------
Revisiting with Owl-------------
--------------------------------
-----(FOWL)
--------------------------------
Enemis:

Items:Aura Blast(SW), All
Boost(S), Sachertorte(QI),
Healing Mail, Kaiser Knuckles,
Lorica, Dark Gate(DC)

Alright now that we can fly
let's get those items we
couldn't before. Also all
portraits we've completed should
have 100% map when we finish.
First go to the bottom of the
Elevator room. If you forgot
where that is. It is only a few
squares right of The Save point
near the 5 portrait room.
Transform into the Owl and fly
up the left shaft to get the
Aura Blast Sub Weapon. Next go
to the room that is just right
of the left most section of the
map. Transform into the Owl and
fly up and then to the left.
This put my Castle Map up to
95.1% Grab the All Boost Spell.

Now return to the City of Haze.
That would be the portrait next
to Wind. Return to the room
where you did that Cart puzzle.
It will be the longest room on
your map. Break the ceiling
around the middle of it.
Transform into the Owl and fly
up. Grab the Sachertorte and
head left to grab the Healing
Mail. This put my City of Haze
map at 100%. Return to the
castle and go to the Sandy Grave
this time. It is the bottom
right portrait. Head to the room
left of the first Save Point.
Transform into the Owl and fly
to the upper left part of the
room to grab the Kaiser
Knuckles.

Now go to the Rolling Boulder
room. It's one up from the
bottom right room. Transform
into the Owl and fly up the
right shaft. Grab the Lorica.
This put my Sandy Grave map at
100%. Return to the Castle. Now
go to the Forest of Doom. Go to
the room thats two down and one
right of the middle Warp Room.
Break the ceiling at the right
of the room. Transform into the
Owl and fly up. Grab the Dark
Gate Dual Crush. This put my
Forest of Doom map at 100%.
Return to the Castle. This time
go to Wind. You should have two
quests beaten on that list.
Spear of Legend and Build your
Strength 2.

Now get your intelligence up to
100. I'll list the best
Intelligence boosting gear for
this. We'll be using Charlotte.

Dalmatica=10 Int found in store
or from Aliorumnas Holy veil=10
Int found in Nation of fools. 4
rooms to the right of the top
warp. Succubus Boots=4 Int
dropped by Succubus. Skull
Ring=6 Int dropped by Lesser
Demon or Paludamentum=5 int from
store. INT Boost=30 Int. This
will give you at most a 66 Int
boost. It is impossible to do
this quest on level cap 1 and 25
from fresh start before
defeating the Final Boss.

After finishing this quest
Mental Training 4 becomes
available. Equip Johnathon with
Stonewall and hold R to have him
use it. Then talk to Wind as
Charlotte. Build Your Strength 3
should appear but you should
have all 5 cakes if you've been
following my walkthrough if not
I'll list them for you.

Green Tea Cake. To get this
break the floor just right of
the first Save Point in the City
of Haze. God down and then left
for it.

Sachertorte, NY Cheesecake,
Mille-feville, Wheat Roll. These
four are in the Bakery which is
behind a breakable wall. This
wall is the right wall of the
room just to the right of where
you got your Green Tea Cake. Hit
the register and then hit the
chandelier. Depending on the
value of the coin dropped you'll
get a different pastry once per
game per coin type. There are
other places with cakes but this
is the simplest list you can
get. Basically anything that
you'd find in a bakery works for
this quest.

Just note that if you have one
of the items in your posession
they won't show up in the
display case for you to get. But
will reappear in the instance
that you have none of it. So you
are guaranteed to be able to get
these four cakes for the quest.

After you take down that quest
Build your Strength 4 shows up.
Have Johnathon use Stonewall
again while Charlotte talks to
Wind. Make sure to accept the
other quests. Now return to the
Dark Academy. Go to the room
just right of the 2nd Warp Room.
Wait near the start of the room.
I wait at the Podium. After a
little bit a ghost should appear
and the quest is done. Return to
Wind. This should leave three
quests left. Find the King of
Birds, Defeat the Ghoul King and
The Gambler. Return to the 5
portrait room. This time go to
the Forgotten City. Which is the
far left portrait.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Mummy Man-----------
--------------------------------
-----(MUMM)
--------------------------------
Mummy Man
Hp: 4500 Exp: 5000 Sp: 60
Weak: Piercing, Fire, Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Block Spikes: Three
blocks appear and push you
against the right wall. They
will then extend spikes towards
the wall. You can dodge this by
jumping over it.

Wrappings: Mummy Man extends his
arms and his bandages go out
towards you slowly and homes in
on your location. You can dodge
this by jumping over him after
he starts his attack. Clear
Skies can stop this attack.

Teleport: Mummy Man unwraps and
then wraps himself back together
in a different spot. Nothing
damaging about this move so no
worries.

Homing Blocks: Several blocks
move out and then position
themselves around you. One block
will turn red and then fly
towards you. Then another until
they all have had a go at you.
To avoid this move just dodge
them as they come at you one by
one, which usually means jumping
over them. He does this move
mainly when your right next to
him. He uses up blocks for the
background to this move. When
they start getting low new
blocks slide down. Clear Skies
can stop this attack.

Strategies Johnathon: Shuriken
and Holy water make great
choices here as they both can
hit four times. Back dash
caneling Darts also is a good
option since you'll get a bulls-
eye from being at ground level.
As for weapons Kaiser Knuckles,
Heavens Swor, Flame Whip,
Unlocked Vampire Killer or even
your best Axe are great choices
for this Boss.

Charlotte: Time Stop and then
place 3 Bwaka Knives right on
the Boss. This will deal insane
damage to him. Salamander does a
great deal of damage to this
Boss. If you could buy it.
Tempest and Summon Gunman can
deal a decent amount of damage
here but nowhere near
Salamander. There are several
attack spells that do decent
damage but these are all I felt
were worth mentioning.

Dual Crushes: 1000 Blades does
insane damage here easily over
2000 depending on your level.
Other than that I wouldn't
recommend any Dual Crushes.

Boss Battle Complete------------

will appear and attempt to push
you out of the room. You can
handle this two ways. The cool
way and the so so way. The cool
way is to start pushing the
Train and then pull out your
partner and both of your push.
You have to summon your partner
to push almost instantly. You'll
cause the train to slow down and
then halt to a complete stop
where it will vanish. The other

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Werewolf------------
--------------------------------
-----(WOLF)
--------------------------------
Werewolf
Hp: 4500 Exp: 6000 Sp: 60
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire, Holy
Strong: Blunt

Attacks Rushing Slash: Rushes
towards you and then slashes
with his claws. Run away or jump
over him to dodge. Jumping over
causes him to do the Uppercut
instead.

Rising Uppercut: If your in the
air as he's rushing towards you
he will do a rising slash. You
can dodge this by either moving
a bit away from him as he starts
the uppercut or going behind
him.

Lampost Javelin: Werewolf grabs
a Lamp post and throws it at
you. The throw is at a set
distance and starts fairly high.
So stepping a bit close to the
Werewolf is the best way to
dodge.

Head Bite: If your really close
to the Werewolf he will pull his
arm back and then grab you
followed by biting your head.
You can dodge this by moving
away when he pulls his arm back.

Pack Call: Werwolf starts
howling. Soon you'll see wolves
jump on screen. They will charge
mindlessly in the direction your
in. You can avoid them by
jumping over them or by
attacking them once to make them
go away.

Strategies Johnathon: Holy
Water, Shuriken, Kunai, and
Bible are all great choices due
to Werewolf's size and shape.
Each will easily hit quite a few
times. Darts when backdash
canceled are a great choice here
as well since you can bulls-eye
while standing. As for weapons
The Flame/Vampire Kill Whips and
Heavens Sword are good. Other
than that your strongest weapon
should do a good number too.

Charlotte: Time Stop with 3
Bwaka Knives placed on the Boss
does insane damage. Salamander
does great damage here. Due to
the casting time you might want
to have Johnathon occupy the
Boss for a bit. Hex, Summon
Gunman, Raging Fire, Ice Fang,
Tempest, and Explosion are all
good spells to use here.

Dual Crush 1000 Blades does an
insane amount of damage. None of
the other dual crushes are worth
doing since simple spells can
top their damage easily.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Medusa--------------
--------------------------------
-----(MEDU)
--------------------------------
Medusa
Hp: 3500 Exp: 6000 Sp: 60
Weak: Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Stone Stare: Medusa goes
to the back of the room and
yells petrify. This will turn
you to stone and if your already
stoned it will hurt you. You can
avoid this by turning away from
her when she yells petrify.
Mirror Cuirass which is dropped
by Gorgon makes you immune to
this move.

Serpent Strike: Medusa's upper
body turns into a Snake head
that will lunge at you. You can
avoid this attack by jumping up
when she starts to pull back.
This will make her attack
upwards.

Snake Arm Bite: Medusa's
positions an arm above her and
below her. Then she lunges
forward as her arm turns into a
snake. You can dodge this by
running away from her and
jumping as she gets close.

Medusa Spawn: Medusa covers her
eyes and several Medusa Heads
fly out forward covering a big
portion of the screen. You can
destroy the heads. Big spells
like Tempest, Chain Lightning or
any spell that functions similar
will work great here.

Tail Crawl: The screen will
shake briefly and then Medusa's
tail will snake in and out of
the ground fairly fast. You can
avoid this move by standing
around where her tail went into
the ground.

Strategies Johnathon: Wrecking
Ball is the best Sub Weapon
here. As it constantly hits over
your head at a decent speed. Axe
and Bible are a good choice as
Medusa is above you constantly.
Cross is another good choice as
you can get it to hit a decent
number of times. Shuriken is for
once an option that I don't
recommend as consistently
hitting with more than one
shuriken is probably going to
get you hit. As for weapons I
recommend your strongest Whip as
it is easily the best weapon for
handling Medusa Heads and can
deal decent damage to Medusa.

Charlotte: Timestop and placing
3 Bwaka Knives on the Boss deals
insane damage. Salamander does a
great deal of damage to the
Boss. If you bought it. Summon
Skeleton, Ice Needle and Tempest
are good spells to use here.

Dual Crush: I don't recommend
you use any of the Dual Crushes.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win exit left. Here
you'll fight respawning Medusa
Heads. Exit left. Grab the Jet
Black Whip. Exit right. Exit
bottom right. You should be in

My Map Percentage was 100% for
Burnt Paradise.

Castle after Paradise-----------

-----(CASE)

Enemies:Brauner(B),
Dracula&Death(B), True
Dracula(B)

Items: Hp Max Up, Foie Gras, Mp
Max Up, 2000 Gold Bag, Robe
Decollete, Speed Up(S)

The Nest of Evil quest should be
completed, which gives you more
quests. The Hundred Tasks,
Master the Holy power and
Almighty should also be
completed. Unless you haven't
obtained all the Sub Weapons or
mastered the select few that are
needed to be mastered. Refer to
the various parts of this
walkthrough for the Sub Weapons
as for mastery go to the Two
Minotaur room in the Dark
Academy. We'll go to the Nest of
evil later. Return to the Five
Portrait Room and enter the
Center Portrait this time. There
will be some dialogue and then
the Boss Battle will start.


--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Brauner-------------
--------------------------------
-----(BRAU)
--------------------------------
Brauner
Hp: 6000 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Blood Art Technique:
Brauner throws a bit of blood to
the side then draws two lines
behind him. Those lines will
show you how the blood will
appear when it smears on the
game screen. This blood will
hurt you if you touch it.
Hitting it will make the blood
vanish for whever you hit. Whip
is probably the best weapon type
for clearing the blood. Various
sub weapons work great as well
for clearing the blood. Like
Bwaka Knife and Discus.

This is Art: Brauner will cross
his arms and a painting will
fall down to him. He will fuse
with this painting and start to
fly around. After awhile he will
spin faster and then fly at you.
You can avoid this by jumping
over him.

Painting of the Soul: Brauner
will say painting of the soul
and then wave his arm in the air
showing blood everywhere. You
can avoid this by moving away
from Brauner to be out of ranged
of this attack. After this
attack he throws one of three
painting atttacks which are as
follows.

Stone Painting: Brauner summons
a single painting. Out of which
will fly several black heads.
These heads will petrify you on
contact. You can hit these heads
away.

Double Painting: Brauner throws
two paintings forward which will
change into a big monster that
goes along the ground and one on
the ceiling. These creatures can
poison and curse you. You can
dodge these usually by jumping
over one and allowing the other
to go overhead. Rocket Slash is
a nice way to get past them too
if jumping doesn't seem like an
option to you.

Spinning Painting: Brauner
throws a painting that two green
creatures with several legs
pointing out all around them
appear. They will move in
opposite directions. You can
avoid them by timing your
movements between the spinning
legs. You can also use Rocket
Slash to go right through the
legs without suffereing damage.
This attack can poison you.

Strategies Johnathon: Cross and
Bible can rack up a decent
amount of damage with their
multiple hits. Wrecking Ball is
a good choice here as it deals
decent damage and hits quite
fast. As for weapons. I'd
recommend your strongest weapons
that are imbued with holy. Or a
Whip type for handling his
techniques. Unlocked Vampire
Killer and it's critical art are
especially good.

Charlotte: Time Stop and then
placing the 3 Bwaka Knives on
the Boss once again deals insane
damage. Piercing Beam, Spirit of
Light, Ice Fang and Summon
Gunman are great choices here.

Dual Crush: 1000 Blades and
Grand Cruz are great choices
here dealing a noticable amount
of damage above the other dual
crushes.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win there will be some
dialogue. You will also be
transported to the throne room
stair case. You can return to
Wind for some dialogue if you
want. Immediately drop down
below the platform your on. Work
your way left to grab the Hp Max
Up. Now go to the top right
corner of the room and break the
wall to get the Foie Gras. Go
left to get the Mp Max Up and
the 2000 Gold Bag. Exit left.
Break the ceiling in the center
of the room. Exit up. Head left
to grab the Robe Decollete and
the Speed Up Spell. Exit down.
Enter the Boss Room to the left.
There will be some dialogue
before the fight starts.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Dracula and Death---
--------------------------------
--(DRAC)
--------------------------------
Dracula Hp: 6666 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Holy Strong: Dark Note:
Only his head is vulnerable to
damage.

Attacks Fire Balls: Dracula
opens his cloak and fires three
volleys of Fire Balls at you. In
3 then 5 and then 3 amounts. You
can jump over them or you can
destroy them with an attack. If
you have Speed Up on you can
simply walk through them. You
can avoid them entirely by
jumping over him.

Dark Balls: Dracula will open
his cloak and then shoot some
Dark Balls. They alternate
between low and hi. So you can
avoid these by alternating
between jumping and ducking. You
can avoid them entirely by
jumping over him.

Teleport: Dracula is surround in
light and then teleports away
only to reappear in either the
center of the room, the far left
or far right. This attack does
no damage.

Bat Form: Dracula Teleports to
the center of the room and yells
Bat Form as he starts to change
into several bats. These bats
will then fly forward in the
direction you were in. This
attack will decimate you! You
can dodge this easiest by
Switching to Johnathon and
continually high jumping. You
can also dodge this by doing a
Dual Crush and using it's
invulnerability time.

Death
Hp:4444 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: N/A
Strong Dark

Attacks Side Strike: This attack
will only occur if your flying
right next to him. In which case
dropping down is the best way to
dodge it.

Hell Scythe: Whenever Death
Hovers above you he will raise
his Scythe over his head. Then
he will strike down and off the
screen with a Red Aura. You can
dodge this by moving out from
under him.

Joint Strike: Death will hover
over Dracula and spread his
arms. You'll notice a light
snake across the screen. This
will turn into Scythes that
Dracula will suck up and spit
out as a hoard of Dark Balls.

Scythe Transform: Death
Transforms into a Scythe and
flies into Dracula's hand.
Dracula then slams the scythe
into the ground in front of him
causing a HUGE eruption that
does massive damage. You can
avoid this by continually high
jumping in a corner or running
to the other side of the room.
Speed Up helps with the running.

Strategies Johnathon: Cross can
hit three times for decent
damage. Bible is another good
choice as it's circling attack
can hit both of them. Sadly I
cannot really recommend any
other Sub Weapons. As for
weapons I'd recommend your
strongest weapon with Holy
alignment. Stellar Swords
special can hit both of them so
is a nice choice.

Charlotte: Time Stop and placing
3 Bwaka Knives on the Boss once
again can deal insane damage.
This will most likely really cut
through your mp. As your partner
will suffer several hits. Spirit
of Light will hit both of them
if they are both on the same
screen doing impressive damage
total. Chaing Lightning and
Explosion can hit multiple times
if they are both on the same
screen. Gale Force, Thunderbolt
and Ice Fang can deal some
damage if you want to use them.

Dual Crush: Grand Cruz racks up
an impressive amount of damage
and it's wide range can allow
you to easily hit both of them.
This is the best way to take
them down. Use Spirit of Light
during the cool down time.

After you manage to win you'll
instantly be faced with the
second part of the fight.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:True Dracula--------
--------------------------------
--(TRUE)
--------------------------------
True Dracula
Hp: 6666 Exp: 0 Sp: 0
Weak: Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Knee Strike: Dracula
covers his face and wraps his
wings about him. Then he lunges
forward with his knee extended.
You can dodge this by high
jumping so that he can go under
you. You can also slide under
him. Note: If he is high in the
air he will rush at the ground
quickly as he covers his face.

Ground Strike: When Dracula is
high in the air he will rise
slightly and then immediately
thrust his fist into the ground.
When dracula is low he will rush
up quite fast before thrusting
his fist into the ground. If
your a decent distance away he
will fly towards you at moderate
speed before thrusting his hand
into the ground. You can dodge
this by moving away from him.

Fire Fall: Several pillars of
fire appear at a fixed space
apart and then they fall.This
will last for 5 volleys until
Dracula touches the ground. You
can avoid this by walking
between the pillars as they
fall. You can also jump over the
pillars to move away. Make sure
to keep making progress away
from Dracula as he will slowly
float down towards you.

Death's Scythe: Dracula raises
his arm up and creates a dark
portal. He then pulls out
Death's Scythe and throws it at
you. He throws three. Each throw
is higher oriented than the
last. Jump over the first and
second. Then duck under the
third.

Wing Crush: Dracula flies into
the background and his wings
cover both sides of the screen
slowly inching closer.
Eventually they will come
crushing together causing
massive damage. Then the wings
will start grinding for about 10
hits. You can stop this by
continually dealing damage to
both wings. You can just attack
one side whil Charlotte attacks
the other. Or you can use skills
like Wrecking Ball and Dark
Rift. If you keep hitting his
wings back he will eventually
pull them back. If you fail
entirely at doing that most
likely because your on level 1
cap. Then use a lengthy dual
crush like Grand Cruz for
invulnerability time.

Strategies Johnathon: Cross can
hit up to four times unless he
flies across the screen real
fast. In which case you might
even see another. Bible is
fairly good and can hit a few
times as well. As for weapons
your strongest weapons with Holy
Alignment will work good.

Charlotte: Spirit of Light,
Tempest, and Ice Fang are the
only spells I'd really recommend
for this fight.

Dual Crush: Grand Cruz is once
again the dual crush you should
use. As it still racks up quite
a bit of damage and the other
dual crushes are worthless in
this fight.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you will there will be
dialogue as the ending starts.
Then you'll see that you got a
clear save. What this does is
put you at the last save point
with whatever you had when you
beat Dracula. Now let's go
tackle the Nest of Evil. Go to
the room just right of the left
most room on the Castle Map.
Exit down. The top right room is

Exit right. The top right room
is a Save Room. The bottom right
room is a Warp Room. You'll be
running through a gauntlet here
with the doors locking on you.
Magical tickets will only work
if there are no monsters in the
room. If you wait for a decent
amount of time the doors will
open again. You will also lose
any buffing spells every time
you move to a new room. You
probably will want to save after
every level as well. Exit bottom
left.

Nest of Evil Level 1. Here
you'll fight a Quetzalcoatl and
two Dead Warriors. Exit left.
Here you'll fight two Demons and
a Bone Ark. Exit left. Here
you'll fight five Lightkeepers
and Mothman. Exit left. Exit
bottom right. Here you'll fight
four Minotaurs. Exit right. Here
you'll fight four Jack O'Bones
and a Final Guard. Exit right.
Here you'll fight Balore.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Balore--------------
--------------------------------
-----(BALO)
--------------------------------
Balore
Hp: 3000 Exp: 2000 Sp: 40
Weak: Piercing
Strong: N/A

Attacks Eye Beam: Balore's eye
will glow and then he will fire
a huge laser across the screen.
You can dodge this by ducking.

One-Two Punch: Balore will pull
his arm back before punching
across the top of the screen and
then along the bottom. You can
dodge this by not jumping for
the first punch and then jumping
over the second punch.

Uppercut: If you aren't far
away. Then Balore will pull his
arm down and then punch up. You
can dodge this by moving away.

Smash: If you are far away. Then
Balore will raise his arm up and
then slam it down at the edge of
the screen. You can dodge this
by moving out of the way.

Strategies Johnathon: Wrecking
Ball can rack up the damage
incredibly fast. Bible can hit
quite a few times here if you
set it off near his nose. Axe
can get in a three hits for
decent damage easily. Ricochet
stone when set off next to his
face can hit four times for
decent damage. As for weapons
any strong weapon will work well
here.

Charlotte: Time Stop and placing
3 Bwaka Knives on the Boss is
the best way to kill him.
Salamander can deal quite a bit
of damage over time. Casting the
spell before getting hit can be
a problem though. Tempest,
Summon Skeleton and Ice Fang do
an incredible amount of damage
here and are extremely easy to
hit him with. Acidic Bubbles,
Ice Needle and Hex can deal a
great deal as well. Hex and
Acidic Bubbles will require you
to stand on the hand as your
casting to hit with all or in
Hex's case any of the attack.

Dual Crush: I don't recommend
using any of them.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Gergoth-------------
--------------------------------
-----(GERG)
--------------------------------
Gergoth
Hp: 3800 Exp: 2500 Sp: 50
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire
Strong: N/A

Attacks Suck up: Gergoth starts
to inhale sucking you towards
him. He will bite down below
him. You can dodge this by
staying away from him.

Mouth Beam: Gergoth stands tall
and then starts charging. He
will then sweep down and then up
with his beam. You can dodge
this by ducking next to his feet
or going behind him via Rocket
Slash.

Jump: Gergot kneels down a bit
and then jumps forward a little.
His entire body will go to the
floor covering everything in
front of him. You can dodge this
by sliding under him when he
jumps.

Status Gas: Gergoth will crouch
and start to shake. Then he will
stand straight up and spew gas
from his belly. You can dodge
this by flying into the corner.
Depending on the color a
different type of status will
occur. Gray is Stone. Purple is
Curse. Green is Posion.

Strategies Johnathon: Bible when
thrown from under Gergoth will
hit for quite a few times. Axe,
Holy Water, Cross, Bwaka Knives
and Shuriken can also rack up
quite a bit of damage fast.

Charlotte: Salamander does
insane damage here. Time Stop
and placing 3 Bwaka Knives on
the Boss works quite well. Ice
Fang, Tempest, Ice Needle, and
Hex does great damage here.

Dual Crush: 1000 Blades can do
an insane amount of damage here.
Volcano can do a decent amount
as well.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win exit right twice.
The room to the right is a Warp
Room. Return to Wind at this
point. Accept the Kill Gergoth
quest. Go buy a Blank Book from
Vincent as well. Now go back to
Gergoth and this time when you
kill him. Do it with the
physical attack of the Blank
Book. Only the final blow has to
be with the Blank Book. You can
use spells or even Johnathon up
until that point. Just keep the
amount of damage you've done in
mind. Return to Wind and get the
Cocytus Spell. Return to the
Nest of Evil and go to the
bottom Warp Room. Exit left.
Exit bottom left.

Nest of Evil Level 3. Here
you'll fight two Skeleton
Farmers and three Lesser Demons.
Skeleton Farmer spawns a
Mandragora and several Une. Exit
left. Here you'll fight Alastor.
Alastor drops the Damascus
Sword. Which is the strongest
short sword weapon. Exit left.
Here you'll fight three Demon
Heads and two Yoricks. Exit
left. Head down and grab the
Tome of Arms p1. Exit bottom
right. Here you'll fight five
Gold Skeletons. Gold Skeleton
drops the Gold Ring.

For each Gold Ring you have
equipped on your controlled
character you up the value of
the Gold that can be dropped.
You can only have 4 types of
gold that can be dropped at any
time. The values are 1, 10, 50,
100, 500,
1000. So with one Gold Ring
      you'll have access to 10,
      50, 100, 500. With
two Gold Rings you'll have
access to 50, 100, 500, 1000
Having two of them equipped and
using Speed Up to continually go
down and up the throne stairs is
the best legit way to gain gold.
Exit right. Here you'll fight
five DoubleAxe Armor's. Exit
right. Here you'll fight Zephyr.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Zephyr--------------
--------------------------------
-----(ZEPH)
--------------------------------
Zephyr
Hp: 3210 Exp: 3210 Sp: 60
Weak: Whip, Piercing, Fire
Strong: N/A

Attacks Time Stop: Zephyr will
glow and if you remain on the
ground he will freeze time. He
will then jump over you placing
several knives above you. When
he lands time will return to
normal. You can avoid the knives
by moving out of their direct
descent down. You can stop the
attack entirely by jumping when
he glows. If he decides to do
another attack time will resume
like normally.

Side Swipe: Zephyr floats
towards you with arms extended
and slashes when near you. You
can dodge this by jumping over
him or running away.

Knife Throw: Zephyr puts an arm
to his side and then throws
three knives forward. You can
dodge this by jumping over them.
You can destroy these knives by
attacking them.

Dive: Zephyr jumps to the
ceiling and then dives at a set
angle and throws a knife at you
as he does so. You can dodge
this by moving out of the way.

Strategies Johnathon: Shuriken
is your best Sub Weapon here
racking up great damage fast is
easy. Holy Water can also deal a
decent amount of damage. As for
weapons your strongest weapons
should easily do the job.

Charlotte: Salamander can do
quite a number on this guy.
You'll probably have to use
Johnathon to run distraction as
you charge up your spell. Ice
Needle can do great damage and
you can make it hit reliably.

Dual Crush: 1000 Blades does
insane damage here if you get
lucky and he decides to walk
slowly to you instead of rushing
around.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win exit right. The
room to the right is a Warp
Room. Exit bottom left.

Boss Battle:Aguni---------------
--------------------------------
-----(AGUN)
--------------------------------
Aguni
Hp: 4000 Exp: 3500 Sp: 70
Weak: Ice
Strong: Fire

Attacks Inferno Dive:Aguni
raises his arms and then flies
off the screen. He will then
dive down where you are and
cause a small fire wave trail to
erupt from both sides. You can
dodge this by moving out of the
way.

Smash: Aguni will raise his arm
into the air and then slam it
down. He will do this three
times in a row. He will also
give chase after you. You can
dodge this by moving away from
him enough so that his hand
misses each time.

Fire Wall: Aguni will spit a
flame that moves across the
floor to the wall. It will move
like Holy Water but only it will
last a lot longer. He will spit
three at set intervals. You can
avoid this attack by jumping
over it.

Sway: Aguni will fly left and
right across the screen with no
warning. He will be low enough
to deal touch damage. You can
avoid this by ducking.

Strategies Johnathon: Cross,
Axe, Bible and Wrecking Ball are
all I'd recommend using. As for
weapons I recommend Rahab's
Frost or a strong weapon.

Charlotte: Ice Fang, Ice Needle
and Cocytus do insane damage
here. Really that's all you
should use here.

Dual Crushes: Grand Cruz can do
a decent amount of damage
nothing compared to Charlotte
though.

Abaddon
Hp: 5000 Exp: 4000 Sp: 50
Weak: Piercing, Holy
Strong: Dark

Attacks Locust Conductor:
Abaddon will wave his conductors
baton which will leave a red
streak. This is how the Locusts
will act when they appear. You
can destroy these Locusts by
attacking them. Whip is the only
weapon that can do this.
Charlottes spell Stone Circle
shines here as it makes you
immune to everything but
touching him. Dark Rift and
Clear Skies work well too. And
yes that is his only attack.

Strategies Johnathon: Wrecking
Ball, Cross and Shuriken are all
great ways to rack up the damage
against this guy. Just make sure
Charlotte is protecting you with
one of the anti-locust spells.

Charlotte: Tempest: Offers nice
protection from Locusts and
deals fairly good damage to
Abaddon.

Dual Crush: 1000 Blades can do
quite a bit of damage so long as
you do it right after a Locust
swarm has passed. Grand Cruz is
another nice option but can be
done any time for great damage.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle:Zombie Trio---------
--------------------------------
-----(TRIO)
--------------------------------
Fake Trevor Hp: 3800 Exp: 3000
Sp: 60 Weak: Piercing Strong:
Whip, Holy Note: Becomes much
more agressive and skilled as he
becomes more damaged.

Attacks Strike: Simply put he
pulls his arm back and then
strikes with his whip. You can
dodge this by jump or by
ducking. When he gets serious he
can duck and attack.

Bloody Cross: He will throw a
cross of bones and blood
forward. You can dodge this by
ducking or by jumping over it.

Dark Water: He tosses a bottle
of Dark Water to the ground
which acts just like Holy Water
but only it's dark. You can
dodge this by jumping over it or
moving away.

1000 Blades: Trevor will get a
huge glowing column of energy
surrounding him before he starts
to throw blade after blade. You
can dodge this by jumping over
him or flying up.

Fake Grant Hp: 3800 Exp: 3000
Sp: 60 Weak: Piercing Strong:
N/A Note: Spends most of his
time on the ceiling and is
relatively harmless. Note: Hit
him enough and he will fall
down.

Attacks Knife Throw: He throws a
knife directly below him. You
can dodge this by not being
under him. Yes he will do this
attack even when you won't get
hit.

Knife Throw 2: Grant pulls out a
knife and then drops to the
ground. He then throws it
forward. He sometimes will throw
a second knife. You can dodge
this by jumping over it.

Fake Sypha Hp: 3200 Exp: 3000
Sp: 60 Weak: Piercing Stong:
Fire, Ice, Lightning Note:
Hitting her a couple times will
cause her to be stunned this
will interupt her spells. Note:
As she gets more damaged she
will change spells down the
line. Note: She will perform her
spells wherever she is
regardless of whether or not
she'll hit you with them.

Attacks Stone Breath: She will
put her hands together and a
grey puff will appear. Then she
will spray grey smoke down from
her. This will cause stone. You
can dodge this by making sure
your nowhere below her.

Flame Breath: She will put her
arms to her sides and then she
will do a little spurt of fire,
before breathing flames out of
her mouth straight forward. You
can avoid this by not jumping up
into it.

Balls of Light: She will put her
arms to her side and then a
purple puff will appear before
she launches three purple balls
at you. You can dodge this move
by going behind her or by
jumping forward between them.

Ressurection: She will make a
small red aura of energy appear
and revive an incompetent
version of Trevor if you killed
him. You can destroy him in a
few hits or stop her from
casting it by attacking her a
few times to stun her.

Strategies Johnathon: Wrecking
Ball can really do a number to
Sypha. Axe is good for getting
Grant off the ceiling and
dealing damage. Boomerang with a
short hop you can hit all three
of them at once. Shuriken can
deal great damage to one of them
at a time. As for weapons use
whatever you want this battles
easy.

Charlotte: Tempest can deal lots
of damage and can even hit all
three at once! Rock Riot is a
good choice for dealing damage
to any of them. Gale Force is
pretty much guaranteed to hit
two of them for decent damage so
is a worthwhile choice.
Explosion and Chain Lightning
can do a number as the hits
recoil between them.

Dual Crushes: Dark Gate and
Grand Cruz can get some good
damage on everyone. 1000 Blades
can deal insane damage to
Trevor.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Complete------------
--------------------------------

After you win exit right. The
top right room is a Warp Room.
The bottom right room is a Save
Room. Return to Wind now. You
should have the Lost Page quest
done. Tome of Arms X is your
reward. It might have a bit of
an attack drop from Tome of Arms
3 but you'll notice it has Holy
Element. Which means it gets
added damage to quite a bit of
enemies in the game. This should
be the last quest. You should
have no more quest left. Now for
your real reward. Exit left.
Grab the Magus Ring from the
center of the room. Your pretty
much never going to run out of
Mp with this. Now return to the
Nest of Evil and go to the
bottom Warp Room. Exit left.
Exit bottom left.

Nest of Evil Level 7. Here
you'll fight the Doppelganger.

--------------------------------
Boss Battle Doppelganger--------
--------------------------------
-----(DOPP)
--------------------------------
Doppelganger Hp: 2000 Exp: 2000
Sp: 99 Weak: Piercing Strong:
N/A Note: Can become Charlotte
or Johnathon at random this is
decided upon entering the room.
He will stay in that form for
the fight. Note 2: Will have the
exact same weapon and sub
weapon/spell that the character
copied had upon entering the
room.

Attacks Strike: Will attack with
whatever weapon he ended up
with. If the range is too short
like a fist or the Encyclopedia.
Then they won't move forward
enough to hit you.

Sub Weapon/Spell: Will use
whichever you had equipped at
the battles start.

Strategies For this poorly coded
Boss I think anyone and everyone
can take him down without
needing my input. Have fun.
Remember you decide how
dangerous he can be. Might put
my own stuff here during the
next update. Maybe ^_^

Many thanks go to Darth Nemesis.
His several contributions to
gamefaqs helped speed up the
creation of this walkthrough.

Thanks to Action for pointing
out that sliding on the ground
can break the floor.

I want to thank Konami for
making another excellent
Castlevania game. Keep them
coming. ^_^

I want to thank all the people
who supported me and showed an
interest in my efforts. Even the
unsung people who posted in my
walkthrough topic that got
purged due to me losing
interest. Specifically the
person who suggested Darts
against Astarte and the
individual who mentioned drop
kicking Whip's Memory into
submission.

I want to thank Gamefaqs for my
copyright paragraph.

destroying Death's Scythes can
prevent the joint attack between
him and Dracula.

the walkthrough itself.
