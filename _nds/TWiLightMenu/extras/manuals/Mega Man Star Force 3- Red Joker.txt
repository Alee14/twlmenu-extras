Well. Hello. I am
MegaBassFalzar. I doubt you've
heard of me. If you have, fine,
if you haven't, also fine. I'm
writing this guide because,
well, GFAQs didn't have one and
I'm a nice guy.


================================
| Basic Information [BASICB]|
================================


STORY: It is the year 22XX.
Technology is now mindblowingly
awesome, to the point where the
only possible explanation is
that a wizard did it. Indeed,
one major piece of technology is
actually called a Wizard, which
is basically an artificial EM
being that performs functions
similar to those of the navis in
the Battle Network series.
Anyway, because of the increased
technology, the crime level has
also increased. Sounding
familiar? With the new
technological advances, virus
levels have been on the rise and
a new kind of stuff called
"Noise" was discovered. Similar
to the way carbon dioxide is
released by the burning of
fossil fuels, this "Noise" is
released by EM waves. A
ginormous meteor made of Noise
is hurtling toward Earth, most
likely aimed at Electopia for
dramatic effect, and the heroes
must stop it before it's too
late. Again, I'm getting that
deja vu feeling.

================================
|                              W
================================

Cutscene: Two people with
obviously custom sprites,
lurking at night and stargazing.
It's quite obvious that these
are the bad guys; you can tell
by the darkness

of their clothing colors. The
short one who needs some sleep
starts saying something about
wishes coming true. The older
one who looks like jailbait says
that their wish will most
definitely come true. The view
goes upward, showing a glowing
ball in the sky. Note: Anything
in the sky that looks at least
ten times bigger than a star is
not a good thing. Especially if
it's red.

Then it goes to black and the
story is explained. To put it
short, no one has learned from
their mistakes and EM society
has begun to walk the same path
that Net society took 200 years
ago. Interesting, neh?

Cut to a classroom, where the
great and mighty hero of Earth
is... learning how to upgrade
his equipment. Omega-Xis wants
to know what's going on, but Geo
is holding back that
information. The class gets
excited about something, the
teacher and his fro are
explaining that something, and
then that something begins. As
soon as it's over, Mr. Shepar
talks about it, mentions that
its new name is the Hunter-VG,
and then you get to enter a name
for yourself. Pick a cool name,
nothing stupid like awsum342.
The teacher will then explain
pop-ups. To put it simply, on
your new Hunter-VG, every time
someone says something that is
plot or sidequest relevant, a
little clickable box will appear
on the bottom screen. And even
when you're talking to random
people, their name and their
Wizard will appear on the bottom
screen as well, unless they
don't have one or both. You will
then have to touch the school
emblem that's on the bottom
screen.


HUZZAH, SCHOOL IS OVER. Omega-
Xis wants to speak with you on
the roof. Geo mentions wanting
to speak to the teacher.


In control: If you want, you can
talk to Mr. Shepar. If you
don't, go to the roof. It's
rather simple. Leave the
classroom by going to the far
left and walking into the part
that sticks out from the rest.
Then go all the way to the left
again and you will see three
boxes pop up on the bottom
screen. Since we want to go to
the roof(and because the others
are grayed out), tap the yellow
one labeled "Roof".

Cutscene: And Omega-Xis flips,
freaking out because you just
forcibly altered his data. This
is roughly the equivalent of a
strong psychic breaking into
your mind and horribly screwing
you up. Total mind rape. Then he
tells you to put on your
Visualizer. You do so
automatically, and voila, you're
able to see EM people. Omega-Xis
explains some stuff and then Geo
gets a call from Luna. If you
don't know who Luna is, she's
the overly arrogant and
controlling girl with huge blond
hair. I hate her. She has a
crush on Mega Man(read: "Geo").
Anyway, she starts ordering
around, demanding that you get
to the first floor candy shop,
not really giving you a reason.
See? It's just as I said, she's
controlling. Another word that
describes her begins with the
letter "b" and rhymes with the
word "witch".

You gain control briefly. Walk
toward the elevator and watch
something happen. I sense a
tutorial coming on, does anyone
else?

Oh, look, nerds! And a rocket
that looks a bit too phallic for
a children's game! But dear
lord, the sprinklers are out of
control. NOT THE SPRINKLERS!
THEY MIGHT RUIN OUR POCKET
PROTECTORS! The science lackeys
run over to the sprinkler while
the head geek stands at a safe
distance. The lackeys do a lot
of nothing, shouting random
Battle Card names while looking
at the sprinkler. For no real
reason, the sprinkler seems
hellbent on destroying the
rocket. Its spray suddenly
focuses on the head nerd, as he
was the last obstacle on the
sprinkler's path to total rocket
annihilation. The sheer force of
the water forces the nerd to
spin, and Omega-Xis wants to
help. Were it up to me, I would
leave them. However, Geo is a
nice guy(and the game needs a
tutorial), so he decides to
help. Mega mentions that thanks
to tech advances, you can now
pulse in anywhere instead of
just at a Wave Hole as in
previous games. Geo Wave
Changes, becoming *gasp* MEGA
MAN! Or wait. It's not working.
Crap, he broke it. And then it
beeps. Crap. The police are onto
us. RUN. Wait. What? The police
now know that Geo is Mega Man
and they're not going to do
anything about it? What happened
to Bob Copper? Why is he not
chasing us, babbling and trying
to take us in? I have no idea.
Anyway, you now gain control.


In control: Hit the R button.
You should automatically go onto
the Wave Station access point.
Once you're on the Wave Road,
Geo notices that his sprite has
changed and Mega handwaves it by
saying it must be the new tech.
It goes over to show you the
sexy new access point that
replaces the old touch-screen ES
spaces of the previous games. Go
over to said access point and
touch the large blue rectangle
that appears on the touch
screen. Hooray, IIIIIIIIT'S TUT
TIME!

Walk over to the viruses. A
cutscene will begin. Mega and
Geo exchange meaningless words
and then the battle starts. Mega
assumes Geo has forgotten to
battle and thus the tutorial
begins. I'm not going to explain
anything, as the battle tutorial
in this game is not skippable.
Read and learn, or do like me
and hold down the B button to
get through as fast as possible.
It's cake.

Afterward, you get an assload of
messages explaining battles.
Read them if you want. I didn't
want to. While you're in here,
run south and grab the spinning
blue thing for a LongSword. From
here on, I won't mention Blue
Mystery Waves. If you see one
and want to grab it, go right
ahead. When you're done here,
hit the R button to trans out.
Then hit the R button to pulse
out and become mild-mannered Geo
Stelar. And get yet another
message. Go talk to the nerd.
Capcom, of course, lets the
little girl mention being wet.

So yeah, another explanation
about what Purposes and Teams
are. Geo and Mega discuss Geo's
semi-deceased father. Geo freaks
out because he knows that Luna
is a controlling bwitch. Anyway,
go over to the elevator and tap
the yellow box labeled "1F".
Walk left until there's a
cutscene. You now get to learn
about Wizards. A WIZARD DID IT.
Seriously. Anyway, blah blah,
stuff not plot-relevant. Walk
over to the candy shop(all the
way to the right), and talk to
the girl with the stupidly
massive hair.

And of course she starts yelling
at you. I hate her. I just wish
she would die, preferably in a
horribly painful way. And then
Bud and Zack get on your case.
As soon as you explain that you
were late because you were
running around as Megaman, her
hormones surge and she forgives
you in an instant, even wanting
to know why you didn't come to
her dressed as Megaman. Roleplay
fetish anyone? She then insists
that she has feelings for
Megaman and not Geo, though that
is a blatant lie. Omega-Xis then
comes out and torments her. +10
for Omega-Xis. Geo is ordered by
Luna to call Mega off, so he
does. And this is where things
get plot-relevant. Luna wants to
form a selfish Purpose, to get
herself elected. If you want to,
have her explain Brother Bands
to you. I know what they are, so
I decided I didn't want to. You
then get to go through yet
another tutorial. Have fun
entering a message. You then get
control for about five seconds.
Talk to Bud and Zack to form
Brother Bands with them. The
four of you now discuss Team
names, and after a discussion,
Luna tells you that she has a
name already. She even brags
about how great it is. And then
you find out that it's "Luna 4
Prez." Seriously, what? That's a
great name? Hardly. Then Zack
mournes that she named his dog
"Catnip." Again, what the hell.

And now it's time for you to be
her pawn, running around and
doing good deeds in her name.
Walk down the hall, talk to the
tall guy with blue hair. He
doesn't say much, he just
mentions that it must be hard,
going in and out of Cyber Cores
and the Real World. Oh, it's
just a guy that knows you're
Megaman.

Wait.

What.

He knows you're Megaman? HE MUST
DIE. Anyway, back to the game,
go talk to the Nurse Wizard.
She'll tell you that there's a
kid on the roof who needs help.
So of course, being the mindless
drones that we are, we must head
up to the roof and talk to the
kids near the tree. They're
angsting over a tree. With your
Visualizer on, it turns out that
the entire tree is actually
inside an invisible orange box.
That lets you know that the tree
is a Real Wave, which is a kind
of funny name when you realize
that there's nothing real about
it. Anyway, the angsting boys
need help. Luna's been stalking
you, so now that you know of
someone that needs help, she
comes out of the shadows. Turns
out that the boys want to make
the tree pink for their girl
friend. They mention that there
is a lock on it, one that only a
teacher can get by, but Luna of
course has to prove them right
and goes over to it in an
attempt to bypass the lock. Geo,
who has more sense, actually
tries to help. He wonders why
they don't just ask the teacher
in charge of the lock, but then
they say he's too scary.

Anyway, once you regain control,
go to the second floor and walk
all the way to the end, where
you will see a generic man
sprite. Geo is completely scared
of him, so Mega says you should
go fix the moth display. From
here, go to the roof.

Walk over to the left and pulse
in, then head onto the Wave
Road. Walk along the path,
taking the ramps down. Step into
the portal and follow the ramps
downward. Walk into the access
point that will take you into
the moth display. Talk to the
Hertz in the center, he'll
burble a bit, and then wake up.
Turns out that the bizarre noise
he was making was the sound of
his snores. The moth display is
now fixed and he decides to
explain Default cards to you.
Trans out and pulse out, and go
talk to the generic man sprite
that is known as Damon Crow. He
sounds like he's angry, but he's
actually very happy. So happy,
in fact, that he's going to give
the key to the lock to a boy
that he met fifteen seconds ago.
Aren't adults so helpful and
naive in this game?

So anyway, go back to the roof
and talk to the boys again. The
girl comes from nowhere, Mega
will force you to touch the
bottom screen for no real
reason. So what did this
irrelevant touch screen
interaction do? It somehow made
the large evergreen tree
magically transform into a
fruit-bearing tree. And if the
tree doesn't actually bear
fruit, it's because it's fake.
Seriously. Luna shows up to take
the credit, just to score some
points with the voters. God I
hate her.

So the boys agree to vote for
her, even though she actually
did nothing, and so the day is
saved, thanks to Megaman. You
should get an e-mail from Bud.
Since Bud is fat, of course he
would be searching the snack
shop for people who need help.
He found one, and is incapable
of dealing with it himself, so
he needs your help. Head down to
the first floor, and notice that
Luna has once again followed
you. Head into the snack shop to
find a loli in trouble. Talk to
her and before she can explain
the problem, Luna shows up, and
Omega-Xis shows some
intelligence and points out
Luna's stalker-ish behavior. She
of course makes up a bs excuse,
and Geo is as clueless as Lan
used to be. Anyway, this little
girl has a problem. She's
vertically challenged and can't
afford the height- boosting
operation. Geo, being a nice
guy, will instantly pull out the
checkbook and pay for the whole
thing.

Hah, just kidding. She actually
just had a fight with her
friend, and sent an e-mail
because she doesn't have the
nerve to speak to her friend
face-to-face. Of course, Geo is
going to help, because Luna
commands him to. Once you have
control, go into town and go
over to the park area in front
of the Big Wave. Confront the
blue-shirted loli who looks
suspiciously like her friend in
a different outfit, and you'll
find out that she never got an
e-mail. Looks like there's an
issue on the Wave Road, so it's
up to Megaman to save the day.

Pulse in, head onto the Wave
Road via the Wave Station next
to Geo's house, and follow the
path until a cutscene begins. A
harmless Mettaur is attacking a
poor Hertz. MEGAMAN TO THE
RESCUE! Holy crap, that harmless
Mettaur is now freakin huge.
Dispose of the viruses and they
explode in an overly dramatic
fashion. The poor Hertz, now
safe, runs off to deliver his
message.

Run back to the shop and talk to
the girl. Her absurdly similar
looking friend will come over
and suddenly they're best
friends again. Odd, isn't it?
Luna, of course, shows up just
in time to take the credit
again. The girls promise to vote
for her, and Luna compliments
you. Zack gives you a call, and
it looks like the geeks need
help again. TO THE SCIENCE ROOM!

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

Once there, you find out that
they need a Giga Energy Card.
Their rocket cannot launch
without an obscure MacGuffin
that has never been mentioned
before this moment. Magnes the
Wizard comes out, you chat for a
bit, and Luna rudely announces
that she has a ton of money and
is willing to buy the Science
Club's votes. Er, no, everyone
else objects to that because
Luna is a doofus and doesn't
realize that that is illegal.
Woody says that only a police
officer or a military dude would
be able to get one, and that a
kid getting it for a club
project isn't good enough. It's
not legal to sell them to
civilians or something. Pedia
says that the only way you could
get one is if a miracle occurs.
CUE THE PLOT DEVICE! You receive
an e-mail telling you to go to
the front hall. Run to the
elevator, go to the first floor,
and then go toward the school
entrance until a cutscene
begins.

No one is here. How rude. And
speaking of rude, Luna shows up.
Your visitor hears her
complaining and announces that
he was actually at the school
snack shop, buying cheap candy
to gorge himself on. Bud,
another fan of gorging on candy,
tells the guy that Mega Snacks
are freakin awesome, so the guy
starts munching on one right
right there. Wait a minute. This
is the guy who knows you're
Megaman. He says out loud, in
the entrance of a school, that
Geo is Megaman, but luckily no
one is around to here.
Thankfully, he is not your
enemy. Or so he says. We'll find
out later on in the plot if he
really is your enemy. Turns out
the guy wants you to go to the
mall and kick some ass. Luna
lets slip that you need a Giga
Energy Card, and this guy that
you have just met tells you that
he can get you one, easy as
that. He then uses it as
leverage to get you to fight in
the tournament. Luna completely
flips sides, telling you that
you have to do it, where a few
seconds ago she was saying you
shouldn't. Goddam huge-haired
blondes. With one final line
about Megaman, Ace leaves you
alone and walks out the school's
front door. Omega-Xis gives Geo
a subtle compliment, which Geo
refuses to admit is true. Luna
orders you to go home and get to
sleep. Cutscene over.

Somehow, there's a Nurse Wizard
that was literally not there
five seconds ago. Huh. Anywho,
time to go home. I assume you
know the way. Once there, go
into your room and go to sleep,
saving if you really want to. I
find it odd that Geo's house
only has one bedroom. Kind of,
uh, interesting, neh?

Once the long night is over,
Geo's mom comes in. And now we
have to advance the plot! Before
we do, though, I'm going to
point out some Noise Wave spots.
For the first one, go into the
kitchen with Geo's mom and turn
into Megaman. Walk over to the
three blue ball things on the
wall and press A. You get a
message telling you that
abnormal Noise Activity was
detected, and not to press A
again. Don't listen, and face
the huge hole as Megaman and
press A. You enter the Noise
Wave, which is like a CC made of
Noise. It actually looks pretty
cool, and just like CCs have
Hertz in them, Noise Waves have
Noisms. It's a stupid name,
though, so I shall refer to them
as Noise Hertz. Eerily, the
soundtrack for this place does
not loop and eventually the area
will be completely silent. Kind
of creepy. walk around, talk to
the Noise Hertz if you would
like, pick up any Blue Mystery
Waves you happen to want, and
let's go!

Cross the river and go over to
Bud's house. There are two Noise
Waves here, at least. One of
them is in the doghouse, the
other is Bud's bed. You can't
actually go inside Bud's house
yet, though, so just walk over
to the red thing in front of his
house. Holy crap, magic, the
entire bridge turns orange and
disappears. Real Waves are damn
popular these days, aren't they?

Huzzah, the mall. It's been a
while since we had one, so I bet
it's time for a pointless quest
that will distract us from the
plot. Oh look, the bad guy we
saw in the opening cutscene.
What's he doing here? Oh well,
he won't say anything, so just
walk along the hallway until a
cutscene begins. The security
walls block the way, but
conveniently there's a Wave
Station. Turn into Megaman and
head into the Security System
CC. Walk straight ahead in the
direction you're facing. When
you get to the pink Hertz, go
down and right until you see a
blue thing. Step on it to be
whisked away, then step on the
other one. You should see a fat
Hertz standing in the middle of
a big square. Talk to him to
release the gates. If you'd
like, explore the rest of the
CC. When you're done, trans out.
Yay, the walls are gone! If
you'll look to your right, you
can see a Merchant Hertz. Buy
something if you want, then
pulse out. Go into the Mall
Event area(you can find it
yourself, it isn't hard), and
find out that Ace has somehow
beaten 60 Wizards while you were
dealing with the security alarm.
What the hell.

So the announcer announces that
Ace is about to fight Megaman.
While Ace is snacking, Geo
pulses in and appears in front
of him. The crowd goes freaking
nuts. And then the Security
System goes off. If you recall,
there was a Wizard standing next
to the Wave Station when you
went to fix the Security System.
That Wizard is now completely
out of control. Walk a short way
forward and a cutscene begins. A
brief chat, then it's battle
time. KILL THE WIZARD!

After an easy battle, another
cutscene. The Wizard comes back
to life and is pissed. Acid,
Ace's Wizard, comes out and one-
shots him. A playing card falls
off. I'm having an eerie Batman-
related flashback here, but no,
this is not the work of the
Joker. Well, in a way, it is the
work of a Joker, but not the
Batman villain who was best
portrayed by Heath Ledger. Some
generic Nurse Wizards come and
escort the poor fellow away, and
for some reason Acid doesn't
want to battle anymore. Omega-
Xis gets mad, but Geo has more
sense and tells Acid to just
ignore Mega. Ace leaves and the
cutscene ends after some more
talk. You get the Giga Energy
Card, though, so the plot can
once again move forward. Pulse
out and go talk to Luna. Another
cutscene, during which you'll
see the Satella Police
Commandos. The Commandos are
explained and it's hinted at
that Ace is actually one of
them, which explains how he got
the Giga Energy Card. Luna runs
off because she can't handle the
nerdy aura Zack has been
projecting since the Commandos
showed up, and the cutscene is
over.

Go all the way back to Echo
Ridge, into the school building,
up to the second floor, to the
science club room, then talk to
Woody. Go through the dialogue,
then touch the card on the
bottom screen when prompted to.
Luna gets more votes and once
the rocket is all but launched,
Geo gets a new Brother. Go home

and go to sleep, save if you
want. No more for today. While
you're asleep, disaster strikes
expectedly. The two villains go
into the Science Club room and
pull some magic hax with a card.
Magnes gets cool and big and
turns into Spade Magnes. Geo
wakes up and is excited to get
to school! Little does he know
that plot is about to intervene.
  Go to the roof of the school.
  Captain
Nerd enters the launch codes
and... nothing happens. Sparks
and electricity everywhere! Geo
doesn't seem to understand that
it's malfunctioning, and Luna's
only input is along the lines of
"Something must be wrong!" God,
she's vapid. The minor science
geeks say that it's going to
explode, as if we didn't know
that already. Geo says that he's
going to handle it, and everyone
else is stupid and stays behind
because they wanted to follow
Luna's example.

Pulse in and go onto the Wave
Road. Follow the path to the
Rocket CC. You get a call from
Luna who says Woody has another
Wizard that's going to help you.
Follow the path until you get to
an octagon that's red and blue.
Coil shows up and Geo goes over
to the octagon to get
magnetized. Walk into the white
stream of magnetism. Follow the
only path until you get to the
blue box. Walk into the white
stream of magnetism. Go down the
path and walk into the stream
that leads to a red box. Keep
going in that direction until
you get to the octagon. Step
onto it and tap the Coil popup
to reverse your polarity. The
bubble around you should now be
red. Walk upward and leftward to
progress through the area. Step
onto the stream of magnetism to
get pushed over to a platform.
Follow the only available path
until you see another octagon.
Don't step on it, though, stay
red. Walk onto the path, angling
it so you get through to the
other side. There yet? Now you
have to cross three of them.
Step into the portal once you're
through.

Step onto the octagon and make
yourself blue. Make the blue box
repel you to the other platform.
Follow the path and let yourself
be pulled to the red box. Walk
over to the pink thing and step
into it. Follow the path until
you get to the octagon, and turn
your bubble red. When the blue
box has spun around enough
you'll be pulled over to it.
Turn yourself red and get
yourself pushed over to the
other side once you're there.
Make your bubble blue and run
through the next path, timing it
so the magnets don't drag you
in. Follow the path and get
yourself pulled to the red box.
Then let the blue one push you
over the gap. You know the
drill. Time it so you can get
across without being pushed onto
the pink thing. There are two
sets of two to get across. Once
you're through, go along the
green path until you get to a
red square. I advise you save
here, because it's boss battle
time.


Boss Battle: Spade Magnes
Element: Elec Weakness: Grass
Difficulty: Easy Strategy: You
don't need much of one. He has
400 HP and weak attacks. Spade
is easy, what can I say? If you
manage to delete him fast
enough, you'll get his card,
which didn't happen in previous
games. You should have no
problem getting the card.
Attacks: Rocket Launch: A single
white rocket spawns on a tile
and fires down the row. Magnes
Drill: Magnes turns into a drill
sort of thing and fires himself
down
    the row.
Gravity Amplification: Magnes
disappears, appearing right in
front of you and
      rooing you to the spot. He
      then slashes twice.


Spade Magnes reverts to normal
Magnes. Huzzah, you won. And
then the rocket launces. You win
double. Turns out Ace was
lurking the entire time. He
talks about the plot for a
couple seconds, then munches on
some Mega Snacks. Cut over to
the bad guys who are talking
over the severe lack of
explosions. They get a call from
a mysterious man who tells them
that Megaman stopped the school
from exploding. After a humbling
show of subservience, the call
is over and the boy shows his
impatience. You get the option
to save once the cutscene is
over.

+----------=====================

Oh crap. Meteor G got faster.
And worse, it's headed straight
for Earth. Some talk, then the
alarms go off. WE ARE UNDER
ATTACK! Or rather, everyone but
us is under attack! Cut to Geo's
house, where Omega-Xis is
materializing and
dematerializing over and over,
something about working out. Geo
teaches us the wrong lesson by
saying that watching television
is more important than saving a
mall full of children. Omega-Xis
has the right idea when he calls
it an idiot box, though that
could be a possible Spongebob
reference. The tv comes on and
Legendary Master Shin is
discussing Noise on a talk show.
Turns out Noise is being emitted
by EM technology the way carbon
dioxide is being released by
automobiles in America. And this
Noise crystallizes to form a
substance called Crimson. And
now it's time for school!

Once you get control, walk
toward the house's exit and
you'll get a call from Woody.
Magnes is in space! And he sends
you an ability program, an
HP+50/120. What this means is
that if you have 120 or more
LinkPower available, you can
equip the program in the ability
screen to boost your max HP by
50. You then go straight to the
Ability screen. Equip the
HP+50/120 and then press B. Once
done with that, leave the house
to get an e-mail telling you
about maps. These maps aren't
all that useful now and will
never be vital, so only check it
out if you want to. Go over to
the school to find out that the
gate is locked and that the
super-scary generic man sprite
of a teacher is sick. To open
the gate, you'll need to go talk
to him. Go over to Luna's
apartment building and walk up
to the door. A number pad will
pop up on the bottom screen.
Type in the number "202" and hit
OK. This teacher gives you the
key to the school. I guess Geo
is just a trustworthy sort of
guy. Go back to the school gate
and tap the blue rectangle on
the bottom screen when it gets
larger. The gate opens and it's
time for school.

Go up to the second floor and
walk into the classroom. On the
way, you'll pass a boy on the
first floor who's doing a pretty
good impression of The White
Rabbit from Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.
Talk to everyone in the room to
learn that a new student will be
transferring in. And apparently
a new teacher as well. They come
in and

What

THE VILLAINS ARE NOW IN OUR
SCHOOL?!?!

Oh well. Cutscene continues and
everyone is bugging Jack. As the
chatter goes on, Jack gets
madder and we find out that Tia,
at only 17 years of age, is
officially jailbait. We also
learn that Jack's mission is to
gather information about Geo.
Tia seems to be here just
because she doesn't want to be
away from Jack, or because Jack
doesn't want to be away from
Tia. Back in the classroom, Luna
tries to break open Jack's hard
shell, only to get yelled at by
Jack. Jack now has my respect.
He calls her stupid and tells
her that she has a big mouth.
Hooray, Jack. Jack walks away
and Geo volunteers to go catch
up with him and try to be
friends.

Head down to the first floor and
leave school. Go to Echo Ridge
Park. A cutscene will start. A
Wizard wanders in and Geo asks
him if he's seen Jack. Jack is
on top of the Big Wave, but no
one else can see that due to
plot- induced blindness, and
Jack wants to just end it now by
taking Geo out. He tosses a card
at the Wizard, who of course
goes out of control. BATTLE
TIME! Geo has a brief moment in
which he becomes genre savvy,
noticing that this sort of thing
just happens to occur near him.
Sadly, he isn't always this
intelligent, but what can you
do?

After an easy battle, Jack shows
some annoyance and almost got
out a hint about his future
plot-relevant plans. And then
the pink ranger shows up to
complement Geo's blue.


RAPE FROM BEHIND.

Geo horribly screws up a chance
to flirt with Sonia, but it's
okay because she knows that he,
much like his predecessor Lan,
is denser than solid Mercury.
They talk for a bit, and then
the fanboys find out that Sonia
is here. Crap, fanboys. Every
single generic male sprite in
town is suddenly heading toward
you, so it's time to escape to
the Wave Roads. Once pulsed in,
follow the only clear path.
You're heading toward the school
roof. If you see a GMD on the
way, don't go get it unless
you're prepared to fight Spade
Magnes V2. Spade Magnes V2 has
800 HP and his attacks do more
damage. He's also a bit faster.
Should you choose to fight him,
good luck.

Anyway, once you're in the
school, keep following the
upward ramps. They'll get you
where you need to be. Once on
the roof, walk over to the Wave
Station to pulse out. Walk
toward the elevator and a
cutscene will begin. The two of
you have successfully escaped
the fanboys. Sonia checks around
to make sure the two of you are
alone, and she's possibly about
to have her way with Geo when
the game developers suddenly
remembered the E rating. In
order to keep it E, Luna and her
gang show up to mess up any of
Sonia's fantasies. Since all
four of you are Sonia fans, you
all immediately agree to be on
tv with her as extras in her
show. 10 points if you can guess
where the next boss will show
up.
  She also wants you to attend
  her concert.

Sonia receives a popup telling
her she needs to get over to the
studio. She seems to forget that
she has dozens of rabid fanboy-
ish generic male sprites waiting
for her in Echo Ridge, and
begins to leave through the
school's main entrance. Geo
reminds her about the fanboys,
and she leaves via Wave Road.
The group discusses travel plans
and Luna announces that
tomorrow, she's going to show
everyone something. The meeting
is now over, so everyone leaves.
Turns out the jailbait was
watching the whole time and is
probably up to something sneaky.
Head over to the elevator, go
all the way down to the first
floor, then go into Echo Ridge.
If you would like to visit the
Big Wave store, it's now open.
Unlike in previous games, where
Cipher Codes were sent by mail
to certain people, Cipher Codes
are now controlled by Ken
Suther's Wizard. His is the
orange one on the counter next
to him. When you're ready to
advance the plot, go home and go
to bed. Save if you'd like.

While you're asleep, Jack and
Ms. Jailbait are discussing the
plot. When they are done, it's
time to go to WBG Studios. Head
over to the Wave Liner and step
on the square to start a
cutscene.

In an odd reversal of the way
things are normally done, Bud
and Geo are both on time while
Luna is late. Her excuse is that
she got a Wizard. It's generic
and doesn't look all that good.
Omega-Xis is much better, and
not just because he's an AMian.
The Wizard has a stupid name and
isn't very useful, but it put
Luna in a good mood so at least
now she won't be barking at us.
Bud mentions that now he's the
only one in the group who
doesn't have a Wizard. This
later is remedied.

You arrive at WBG Studios and
everyone is like OMG I SAW THAT
TREE ON TV and stuffs. Jack
walks in, and sounds like a bad
actor as he tells the group he
wants to hang out with them.
Luna yells at him some more,
showing us that even when she's
in a good mood, she's a total
"witch". Anyway, once the
cutscene is over, head up the
stairs to find out that the door
is locked. Speak to the guard
Wizard to find out you need
special passes to get in. Passes
which Sonia, in one of her cute
moments of forgetfulness, forgot
to give you. Geo decides it's a
good idea to cheat by becoming
Megaman and going into the
building through the Wave Roads.

Head back in the direction of
the Wave Liner. Before you get
there, you'll see the corner of
the parking lot. Walk over into
the parking lot, past the beat-
up car and a Wizard, until you
get to the Wave Station. Pulse
in and head onto the Wave Road.


There's really only one path you
can follow. When you get to the
blue wave- thing, the thing that
shoots you across gaps, step on
it. On the other side, head up
the ramp and into the WBG Main
Building. Once inside, head to
the left at the fork to get to
Sonia's dressing room. Pulse out
and talk to Sonia. G eo misses
yet another major opportunity to
flirt with Sonia, but all is
good. If you want a free
Recov80, examine the table desk
thing in front of Sonia. Once
you're all done here, head back
onto the Wave Road and leave the
building. Head back over to the
Wave Station and pulse out.

Go back up the the studio and
walk to the door. When the
ACCESS DENIED appears on the
bottom screen, tap the studio
pass that Sonia gave you. You
enter the building
automatically, a few comments
are made, and Jack gets even
more respect from me for
completely slamming the lid on
Luna's ambition, if only for a
brief moment. Sonia shows up in
a schoolgirl outfit, which is
about as close to fanservice as
this game is going to get, and
Bud and Zack go nuts in their
own silent ways. Even Geo
actually notices and is of teen
hormone-y about it. After Jack
is introduced to Sonia, Belle
shows up. Belle is an actress
just like Sonia, though she
doesn't have as big a fanbase.
Belle's Wizard/Manager shows up.
This is Ice, and Ice way does
not like Sonia. She badmouths
Sonia for a little bit, and
Sonia agrees with her, which for
some reason makes her angrier.
Bud and Zack point it out: Ice
is basically Luna in Wizard
form. Just a lot bluer. Anyway,
yeah, this entire day is about
Sonia, and we know the bad guys
have something planned. Guess
who's going to become the boss.
Go on, guess. That's right, the
next boss is

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

Okay, for now, you just have to
look around the studio. Just
follow the main hall in an
upward and rightward direction
until you get to an exit. You
should now be in an outside area
with Zack standing there. Walk
into the bigger, inside-the-moat
area so a cutscene will begin.

Wow. There is a freaking huge
Real Wave projector set up
there. A dude with a goatee
walks in and mentions that it is
indeed an awesome device. Here's
what I think. Anyone with a
goatee is either a) a villain or
b) a stoner. I'm gonna say that
this guy is type b. Omega-Xis is
interested in this, and the guy
seems to find it not at all
strange that a glowing blue wolf
is speaking to him. Sure, that
kind of thing is commonplace in
Geo's world, but I say that it's
proof he's a stoner. Anyway, he
then tells you that the entire
stage is projected by that
thing. Which is a horribly
stupid idea when you think about
it, but of course this is a
game. I'm going to give you four
guesses as to what piece of
machinery is attacked during
this scenario. This guy chats
for a bit, then shows off his
super stoner hacker moves. Geo
is impressed, and then the guy
reveals that he knows your name.
Geo, like any sane person, wants
to know how this complete
stranger knows who he is. Turns
out Sonia talks about you so
often that all of the people on
the staff can now name you just
from her descriptions of you.
It's kind of sweet, isn't it?
And it also appears that she's
nice to everyone, even the lowly
peasants that run her show and
make her clothes. Even though
her parents are now dead, she
can still manage to be nice to
everyone, including her rival
Belle. A true goddess, much
better than that blond thing
that orders you around and
becomes a total pain in the ass
later on.

Turns out he's Lee Stern, and
he's head of the staff. He, like
the rest of the staff, is a
total Sonia Fanboy. It's now
time to head over to the tree
road to actually shoot the show.
You know the way. When you get
there, talk to the yellow Wizard
holding the cuecard. Turns out a
vital Wizard is missing and he
needs a main character to go
find the Wizard. That's your
cue. A generic blue Wizard
mentions that the missing Wizard
is good friends with the makeup
Wizard, who is in Sonia's
dressing room. Go to Sonia's
dressing room and speak to the
pink Wizard that's just sort of
lazing around. She tells you
that the Wizard you're looking
for is probably inside the
Regulator, which is that huge
monitor in the editing room. Use
the Wave Station in the dressing
room to get on the Wave Road.
When you get to the blue wave
thing that's near the Wave
Station entrance, step on it.
When you came to get the Studio
pass, there was a Hertz blocking
the way. Once inside the
Regulator, keep going in the
direction you were initially
facing when you transed in.
There will be another generic
blue Wizard sitting there. He'll
be on his way, so you can pulse
out now. Once in the real world,
head into the room with Bud,
Zack, and Luna. Jack is missing,
which Geo points out, and just
before you can discuss it
further, it's time to go be on a
show.

Head out to the tree road again.
As soon as you leave the
building through the front
entrance, a cutscene begins.
Sonia's show is a generic teen
drama, but at least her generic
teen drama involves girls with
pink hair. So few do. The screen
scrolls over to Jack, who... is
standing on yet another
building. What is this kid's
problem? Anywho, his Wizard
points out that the fat kid over
there is emitting a ton of
Noise. Turns out Bud can Wave
Change. Which anyone who's
played the first two knows. Jack
pulls out another card and nails
Bud with it. Bud enters the
beast mode. MINI-BOSS TIME!
Taurus Fire creates some flames
between Sonia and Belle, which
in my opinion opens up for a
joke about Sonia and Belle's
relationship being hotter than
it appears. Back on Taurus, Geo
has Omega-Xis come out and put
out the fire with a sweep of his
claws. Save if you'd like, make
sure your folder is in order,
and then walk toward Taurus. In
front of a television camera
that is at that very moment
recording, Geo Wave Changes into
Megaman. Honestly, how is his
secret identity still a secret?

Mini Boss Battle: Taurus Fire
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Difficulty: Easy Strategy: Dude,
he's at least as easy as Spade
Magnes, if not easier. Hit him
with your powerful attacks and
he will die. It's that simple.
If you want to make this battle
extra-easy, preset Divide Line.
It makes all of his attacks
useless, he'll be completely
unable to hit you. If you can
manage to S-Rank him, which
isn't at all hard, remember that
you'll get his card. It does 100
Fire damage and hits most of the
field, so it's pretty useful
this early on. Attacks: Ox
Tackle: He charges down the row
at you. Cannot be blocked. Ox
Breath: He breathes fire at you.
Ox Punch: He, uh, punches the
square in front of him. This is
sometimes
   used when he's nowhere near
   you. He's that stupid.

After an easy battle, a card
falls off Bud and Taurus offers
to be Bud's Wizard. See, I told
you it would be remedied. Bud
apologizes for screwing
everything up, but the director
Wizard is like ZOMG THAT WAS
EPIC and wants Megaman to be a
temporary main character. Ice
gets mad at this because that it
takes away from Belle's screen
time. Everyone is tired, but
there's still a concert to go
to. Walk into the building for a
cutscene to begin.

Ice is mad. Hopping mad.
Literally. Jack shows up and
mentions that he can give Ice
the power to make Sonia and
Megaman disappear. He shouts "I
give you the title of diamond!"
and throws a card at her. It has
the expected effect of making
her bigger and more deadly.

Now that the cutscene is over,
head to the event stage. In case
you don't remember where that
is, it's the place with the huge
Real Wave projector. Sonia shows
up, mentions that she's never,
and Luna insults Bud for no
reason whatsoever. God I hate
her. Back to the game, the head
of staff/stoner is freaking out
over something. I bet it has
something to do with Diamond
Ice. Turns out someone gave him
a virus bomb and then threatened
him. The message said that the
sender is going to ruin the
concert. Lee and his crack(or on
crack) team are going to un-
sabotage the concert if they
can. THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR
DETECTIVE STELAR! You switch
teams automatically, and your
Purpose changes. Luna admits
that she's utterly useless, and
life goes on.

Once the cutscene ends and you
have control, walk back into the
building. Lee sends you a
message telling you to go to the
prop room because there's an act
of sabotage that took place
there. Go to the prop room, with
is to the right of Sonia's
dressing room, and talk to the
guy that isn't Bud. He tells you
that the cabinet is locked and
hs Wizard hasn't returned yet.
Pulse in, head over to the Wave
Station in Sonia's dressing
room, and follow the path to the
prop cabinet CC. Walk all the
way down and left until you get
to a portal. Step on the portal,
then follow the path until you
find a frozen Wizard. Go up to
it and press A to begin a
cutscene.

Megaman fires his fully-charged
buster at the ice, which doesn't
really do anything. Due to a
mindnumbingly improbable plot-
related coincidence, we just
happen to have a friend whose
Wizard has the fire power(pun
very much intended) to melt the
ice. Taurus comes in and frees
the Wizard, who looks a bit
blue.

This is where Geo proves that
he's nearly as dense as Lan.
There's a female Wizard running
around sabotaging Sonia Strumm
using ice-based attacks. Who do
we know that hates Sonia Strumm,
is a female Wizard, and is
capable of using ice attacks?
Gee, could it be Ice? Time to
trans out. As soon as you do,
Lee e-mails you, telling you
that there's an issue with the
stage projector. He needs you
right away. Go to the event
stage and talk to him. Then,
walk over to the large blue lump
and press on Taurus. He comes
out, defrosts it, and so the day
is saved once again thanks to
ouy cow-themed yet horribly
improbable ally.

Head to the front of the
building. Go outside and get an
e-mail from Lee. Someone said
there is a bomb program, and Lee
sent out some Wizards to hunt
for it. He wants you to
supervise, so talk to the guard
Wizard. All of the bomb-
searching wizards have returned
to him except the one that was
sent to check the stunt car.

Head over to the Wave Station
and pulse in. Head into the
Stunt Car CC, which is the first
Access point you see when you
pulse in from the parking lot
Wave Station. As soon as you're
in, step onto the double blue
wave thing. Once you're on the
other side, head down and step
in the normal- sized blue wave
thing. The frozen Wizard is
right there in the middle. Tap
the Taurus icon on the bottom
screen when you're standing next
to the Wizard. Taurus will come
out and melt the ice.

Trans out and then pulse out.
Looks like the mystery
Wizard(you know, the female ice-
using Wizard with a grudge
againt Sonia) has tried a direct
attack this time. Her dressing
room is frozen. I think there
was a translation error and that
the message is supposed to say
"We need a fire-breathing
Wizard" rather than "We're using
a fire-breathing Wizard". Go
inside and go to Sonia's
dressing room. Tap the huge
Taurus again and he'll thaw the
door out. He takes a second to
praise his own awesomeness. Now
you should go to the Real Wave
Event Stage.

Cool, you now have a stoner as a
Brother. Lee turns around and
activates his super stoner
hacker powers, generating an
entire stage that's like, twenty
feet off the ground and looks
structurally unstable. Turns out
Lee got everyone special
tickets. The concert begins and
everyone is happy. Walk toward
the stage and a cutscene will
begin.

Diamond Ice makes a threat
against Sonia. Nothing new.
Sonia starts playing some epic
music that somehoe only the in-
game characters can hear. Lee
interrupts the concert for Geo
because there's an issue. The
stage is getting colder. Once
Lee points it out, everyone but
Bud notices the low temperature.
Bud doesn't notice because he's
fat. Turns out the Cyber Core is
frozen. Geo freaks out
adequately, and then Belle shows
up. Turns out Ice is missing.
She says that Ice is missing and
has been missing since just
before the threats and sabotage
started. Lee says there's no way
it could be Ice, because Ice
doesn't have that much power,
but Geo can put two and two and
one together to get five. He
knows that there is a way she
could be that powerful. He even
has a plot- induced flashback to
show anyone who's playing
exactly what he's thinking. The
entire stage suddenly gets so
cold it ices over completely,
freaking out the audience.
Similar to the way a badass band
goes down with the ship, Sonia
is determined to keep on rockin'
to keep the audience calm, even
if it means her death. You just
have to love that.

Geo wants to fix everything. Lee
gives him access to the stage's
CC, and Geo pulls off a badass
move the likes of which has not
been seen since BN6. He leaps
off the stage, a fall from which
would kill him, and puts his
faith in his Wave-Changing
skills.

Once in the Wave Road, go into
the Access point and tap the
Stage Pass. The Access point
will unlock and you can enter
it. Upon arriving in the CC, you
get a call from Sonia. She was
worried about you because you
did something stupid and
dangerous, but acknowledges that
that's just the way you are.
Seriously, Geo, if you don't
marry her, I will find a way to
transport myself to your world
and I'll marry her. Take a few
steps forward until you're near
the icy panels. If you stay on
the icy panels too long, you'll
have to bring in Taurus to bail
you out. Also, if any large
cubes of ice are blocking your
way, call on Taurus to come
break them.

There's only one path here.
Cross the two icy panels to get
to a square. When you're there,
turn right and go in a straight
line. Don't turn at all on the
ice path, because there's
nothing there. You're easily
warm enough to survive crossing
the long straight path without
freezing as long as you keep
moving. You'll be at another
square. Again, go straight
across, as there's nothing down
either sidepath, and make sure
you go upwards and rightward,
not back the way you came. Allow
yourself to get back to full
heat when you reach the third
square, then keep going. Don't
go down the side path, a GMW
might be back there and there's
a good chance you'll freeze on
the way. Once there, warm up and
keep going. It's a straight path
and you should have more than
enough heat to get all the way
across. Step onto the pink wave
thing at the end. Don't step on
the one on the other side of
this new square, though. Turn
right and go down the ice path.
Just straight across. Pull out
Taurus to break the ice block
and step on the warp.

Go across the short path to get
to a square. Run across the
right path, straight through the
whole way. Stop to warm up once
you're there. Go straight,
turning left once you get to the
ice square. Without stopping,
stick to the center path. You
should get through with no
problem. Break the ice block
with Taurus and follow the two
wave path thingies. You will
have to run straight through
this next part without stopping,
because on the way there are
dark blue ice panels, which suck
up heat twice as fast. Step on
the warp to go into the final
area.

Walk straight through. Same way
every are begins. Now here the
path splits. Which path you pick
doesn't matter, because they're
really the same path in
different colors. Go along the
green path until you get to a
square of ice. Cross it to the
other green path. Once in the
square at the end of the new
green path, follow the dark blue
until you get to a single tile
of green. When you're all warmed
up, step on the pink wave thing.
Quickly follow the dark blue
path to the square where you can
warm up. Walk through, turning
right as soon as you get to the
branch unless you don't mind
thawing yourself out. Keep
following the path until you get
to the end. Use Taurus to melt
the ice, then go through. I
advise saving while on the red
skull panel. Time to fight
Diamond Ice.

Boss Battle: Diamond Ice
Element: Aqua Weakness: Elec
Difficulty: Easy Strategy: Dodge
her attacks. There's one attack
you can't dodge, and that one
can be blocked with the shield.
She only has 700 HP. An S-Rank
should be easy. Attacks: Ice
Diamond: She stops, twirls
around, and both her ice pieces
launch straight
 down whatever row they're on.
Icy Wind: She blows an icy wind
across the field. The only safe
spot is
   the far right panel. If hit
   by this, it will freeze you.
Snowballs: Her two ice pieces
vanish and fly in from the left.
Use your Y
      shield to block it.

After the battle, she reverts to
normal. Megaman drops to his
knees. Omega says it's probably
the Noise, and out of nowhere,
Crimson appears. It all flies
away. Cut to Jack and Tia, who
are holding a cylinder that's
sucking up all the Crimson.
Everyone wonders why Ice would
do all that, and Ice doesn't
even pretend to not know what
she did. She admits that she
went rogue to kill Sonia and
further Belle's career. Belle
says that's a terrible thing to
do, and Ice says that it's the
only way to be successful. Belle
is smarter than Ice, though, and
points out that Sonia got famous
without hurting anyone. That
pretty much shuts Ice up.

Head back onto the stage and
Sonia will perform the last song
of the concert. It's called
"Shooting Star". She says it's
for all her fans and all her
supporters, but actually reading
the lyrics shows that it's about
Geo and his impact on her life.
To that, I have only one thing
to say.

GEO AND SONIA ARE DESTINED FOR
EACH OTHER. LUNA WILL END UP
WITH BUD OR ZACK OR SOMEONE THAT
ISN'T GEO.

There, that's out of my system.
After the concert, Geo and Sonia
are all alone on a stage, away
from everyone else's sight... So
they reform a Brother Band.
Remember that E-Rating?

Jack is on a building AGAIN. But
this time, so is Tia. Jack's
Wizard comes out when he hears
the name Omega-Xis. Turns out
Corvus is actually an FMian, and
so is Virgo. They both came to
the earth for some lulz. And
their next target is a school
event...

Back at WBG studios, Lee is
trying to talk the Commandos out
of deleting Ice. They're not
falling for it, though, because
they know that there was
Crimson. They want to know where
it went, and they want to know
now. Sonia and Geo run in and
save Ice and Belle from
investigations and such. Turns
out these Commandos are Sonia
fans. She pulls an explanation
straight out the ass, something
about trying to make it snow on-
stage. Too bad the Commandos are
smarter than that. Damn, why
couldn't they all be as
unintelligent as Bob Copper?
Everyone else helps cover Belle
up. Unfortunately, the police
are still all over it until Ace
shows up orders them to go back
to HQ. Ace then asks for an
autograph from Sonia, which even
the other Commandos forgot to
do. She signs it and still seems
kind of in shock. Ace then lets
slip that he knows she's Harp
note, which shocks her even
further. He says he's going to
need to borrow her power soon.
Purpose fulfilled, you now get
the option to save.

Note: This section and the one
after it are kind of half-assed
because I had to write them
twice. Deal with it or find
another guide.


So here's a cutscene. In it,
King reveals that he is the
leader of the evil organization,
which is called Dealer. They're
behind all the Wizard attacks.
He's praising Tia and Jack,
discussing the plot, and so
forth. Looks like King has
managed to get his hands on an
ancient power, which later on
becomes important. Jack and Tia
are ordered to keep collecting
Crimson, and the big black guy
standing there is going to get
his orders off-screen. You can
be asured that this means his
orders are more plot-relevant
than Jack and Tia's.

Three days later, everyone is in
Hawaii. Er, I mean, Alohaha.
Luna mentions that Geo is
missing, which can be confirmed
with a quick visual sweep of the
screen.

Cut to Echo Ridge, where Ace and
Geo are alone in the park. After
some talk, Ace reveals that he
knows Omega-Xis is an illegal
immigrant. Rather than deport
him, he asks about strange
happenings. Geo mentions that
the Crimson made him go numb,
and Ace tells him that too much
Noise will leave Geo dead. Fun
stuff. He then gives you the Ace
Program, which lets you control
Noise. He turns away and starts
talking about you. Odd, eh? He
also gives you a key that will
open the wave road to space.

When the cutscene is over, go
over to the Wave Station near
your house and pulse in. Follow
the Wave Road a short distance
until you get to the huge ramp.
Go up it until you get to a pink
gate. Tap the blue square-ish
popup on the bottom screen to
open the gate. When you get to
the Astro Wave, Geo is like ZOMG
SPACE. You get an e-mail from
Ace telling you what the Ace
Program does.

Step on the big blue wave thing,
then on the other when you
arrive. Follow the arrow into
Astro Wave 2. From here, take
the lower left big blue wave
thing, then take the other one.
You're now in Alohaha. Go down
the huge ramp and step on the
blue wave thing that's just to
the left of the bottom of the
ramp. Step on the small portal
to arrive in Alohaha's real
world.

There's a pretty long cutscene,
during which the castle is shown
and Jailbait gives it a
backstory. The royalty used to
live there, but now all it does
is house an Environmental
Control Center. A Wizard named
Strong runs the whole thing.
Luna has everyone change their
Purpose, then forcibly changes
Jack's for him when he decides
he doesn't want to. Stupid
controlling witch. To advance
the plot, go into the castle and
go all the way to the back. The
Wizard sitting there is not a
custom sprite, which means he is
most definitely not Strong, but
talk to him anyway to confirm
it. When you're done in here, go
outside and go over to the food
stalls. They're on the left side
of the Alohaha area, can't miss
'em. Talk to Bud, who has been
fantasizing about eating a
certain food from a certain
stall. However, the stall isn't
working, so no food for Bud.
Pulse in and go onto the Wave
Road.

Go over to the blue wave thing
and ride across. Go all the way
to the left and trans into the
Food Stall CC. Go down the ramp
on your left and follow the path
that's in the same direction. At
the end of the path, follow the
downward ramp and talk to the
Hertz who's standing in a big
blue square. He was practicing
his dance moves for a party, and
but now he's back in cooking
mode. Trans out, pulse out, and
head back over to Bud. The Beach
is now open.

Go to the right of the area and
follow the sandy path into the
Beach area. Walk forward to
begin a cutscene. A beach scene
happens, one that is hilariously
similar to the one in BN5. Even
Jack gets interested. Once the
cutscene is over, walk upward
and speak to Sonia. Who is here
in a bikini. Yes, I lied
earlier, *this* is as close to
fanservice as this game gets.

Turns out that rock wall is
actually a Real Wave and it's
not working right.


A big Wizard went in to help but
hasn't come back yet. Looks like
it's up to you to go save the
photo shoot. Walk over to the
far left corner of this area and
pulse in, using the Wave Station
to get on the Wave Road. Step on
the blue wave thing that's
directly in front of you. Follow
the yellow path until you get to
another blue wave thing with a
dark access point near it. Go
left from the blue wave thing
and follow the blue wave thing
at the end of the left path.
Trans into the Stone Wall CC.
Walk forward to start a
cutscene.

There's a huge custom sprite
dealing with some viruses. Every
time he kills some, more spring
up. Geo asks to help, then tells
the big guy that he's Megaman.
The big guy recognizes the name
Megaman as the savior of Earth,
and steps aside to let you
handle the viruses.

Battle 1
Koma x 1, KomaG x 1

Battle 2
WibbledeeG x 1, BlueSharkG x 1

Battle 3 KomaG x 1, BlueSharkG x
1, BaseGunner x 1

Once it's over, you're back on
the beach. The big guy
introduces himself. Turns out
he's Strong, the Wizard that
runs the giant weather machine.
He mentions that he'd love to
show your school group the
weather machine, and says that
if you ever have any problems,
come see him. He's a cool dude
like that.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

When it's over, talk to all
three guys, both girls, and the
jailbait. When the cutscene
begins, Bud is wondering if
tropical fish are edible, Zack
is being taught to swim by Jack
and Geo, the two girls are
hangin out in the water. Jack
thinks it's freaking hilarious
that Zack was once trapped in a
submarine in a foreign country,
and I must admit, I find it
funny too.

Jailbait says free time is
almost over. Jack actually wants
to stay at the beach and Tia is
shocked that Jack is having fun.

BUD'S ASS IS FREAKING HUGE.
SERIOUSLY. Gah, it draws my
focus like a black hole draws in
everything.

Anyway, all the stuff is
missing. Time to go see Strong.
Turns out some bad Wizards,
known as the Bandit Wizards,
stole all the stuff. Leave the
castle and pulse into the Wave
Station in Alohaha. Follow the
short path and step on the blue
wave thing. Keep going downward
and rightward until you see a
bad Wizard. This guy has Zack's
pants. Talk to him and a battle
will start. Kill him and his
viruses. Go down the big yellow
path until you get to the
entrance to the Beach Wave Road.

Go twoard the Stone Wall CC
until you can turn right. Keep
going down and right until
you're above a small island. Go
up and right until you get to
another bad Wizard. After the
battle, Geo wrestles with him
and the items get blown away.
I'll let you pick which item you
want to save, because it has no
plot relevance at all. All that
changes is a small cutscene in
which Geo and the person whose
item you saved are on a pier,
chatting and holding hands if
you saved a girl's item. I saved
Sonia's bag, and rather liked
the cutscene.

Jack and Tia Bliaj are turning
Strong evil. When the
transformation is done, he's
freaking huge and looks like a
bunch of rocks covered in moss.
He then uses his super stone(r)
hacker moves to enter the
environmental system and begin
his reign over all of Alohaha.

After that's over, you're back
in control and on the pier. Walk
back to the beach to begin your
item-based cutscene. The next
day, Luna's talking about going
to see the environmental system.
Mega tells Geo the ground just
shook, but Geo says that's
blasphemy as the environmental
system stops all such natural
disasters before they start. Go
into the castle and all the way
to the back.

Strong is gone and there's an
earthquake. Club Strong comes
out and is still completely
fricking huge. He re-enters the
CC. Time to go after him and
save the island. Leave the
castle, pulse into a Wave
Station, and head back to the
castle via Wave Roads. When you
get all the way to the back of
the Castle's Wave Road, trans
into the Eviornmental System
Cyber Core. This area is ext
remely straightforward, so don't
expect a ton of description.

For the first area, follow the
big blue path until you get to a
brown one. Walk onto the brown
one and follow it unil a
cutscene starts. The earthquake
is breaking up the path. Maybe
if they hadn't built the damn
thing out of digital bamboo, it
wouldn't fall apart so easy.
It's pretty easy to navigate the
brown path. Press A when you get
to a crack to jump over it. If
you're too slow, you end up in
an Abyss. Just wander around
until you get to the exit warp.
Once off the brown path, follow
the blue one again until you get
to the entrance to the second
area.

Again, follow the blue one until
you get to brown. Walk onto the
brown to start a cutscene. When
you get to the part where the
paths split, go right. On the
other side of the brown, keep
following the blue until you get
to another brown. No cutscene
this time, just keep going. When
you get to the split, go down.
At the end of this path, head
into area three.

You know the drill. Go down blue
until brown, walk on
 brown.  Follow the
brown path, taking the rightmost
path when you get to the split.
Follow this blue to get to
another brown. However, I would
save if I were you. This short
brown path has a boss at the
end.

Boss Battle: Club Strong
Element: Grass Weakness: Fire
Difficulty: Moderate Strategy:
Kill him. At 1000 HP, he's
pretty tough, plus he
regenerates his HP on grass
panels. The Taurus Fire card
comes in handy here, as do any
Fire cards. Attacks: Strong
Club: He jumps to the spot in
front of you and slams his club
down. Club Tornado: He swings
his club, generating a Tornado
on every row. Use the
     Y Shield to block it.
WoodTower: Every time he lands
while just moving around, he
sends a wood
      tower down the row.
Club Rampage: He'll jump to a
spot in the row in front of you
and start
   slamming his club on the
   ground repeatedly on the
   panel in front of him and the
   panel to either side. Can't
   be blocked, so you have to
   dodge.
Vine Seeds: He'll stop in the
back row and start rolling a
seed down all
   three rows. If one hits you,
   it'll crack open and a vine
   will ensnare you, draining
   your HP. The seeds can be
   destroyed.

Strong is back to normal and
there's a ton of Crimson around.
Club reveals that Jack and Tia
are the bad guys, Joker comes in
and kills Strong, and Geo runs
to go see Tia and Jack. When
you're back in control, go to
the pier. A cutscene will begin
before you get there. It's
pretty simple. Jack and Tia will
Wave Change and Jack will fight
you. Do 400 damage to him and
the battle will end. I'll let
you watch this cutscene for
yourself because it's freaking
awesome. I believe you get the
option to save when it's all
over.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

During the cutscene after that
in Dealer Base, Jack's
childishness is discussed and
Jack leaves in a huff. In the
one after that, Bud and Zack are
all emo over Luna's death, while
Geo and Sonia are taking it
suspiciously well. Hmmm.

It's revealed that she isn't
completely gone. Dammit. Looks
like we need to find someone who
knows how to contact Ace. Go
home and talk to Hope. She tells
you that Mr. Boreal is in
Alohaha, and that you'd better
not be doing anything dangerous
or she is going to kick your
ass.

When the talking is over, leave
the house and go to the Wave
Station. Pulse in and head to
the Astro Wave. Make your way to
Alohaha via the Astro Wave.
You'll somehow end up near the
Wave Liner wicket. Geo imagines
that Luna is talking to him and
Mega says you're being watched.
Go in the castle and walk all
the way to the back, where
Strong used to be. Strong
appears and everyone is like
ZOMG. Turns out Boreal put him
back together. That dude is
better than all the king's
horses and all the king's men.

Ace tells you to come to WAZA,
because Dr. Goodall is good
enough at hacking to build a
human from data. Eerie. The
people from WAZA arrive to take
you there, so it's time to go.
When you arrive, you get a nice
view of the whole building. Go
up to the gate near the building
and type in the number that the
WAZA passcode popup shows. Walk
up to the door Ace is standing
by. A little thing will appear
on the bottom screen. Put your
stylus/finger/pen/whatever on
that little box until it's done
scanning. This is never even
mentioned again, so it doesn't
really matter. Ace says
something that I find pretty
funny, and now you can go
inside.

Talk to Ace. He'll have you go
up the elevator. Go up the
stairs and all the way to the
right, passing Tom Dubius on the
way. He's reconstructed Cygnus
and now has the ability to Wave
Change. Anyway, when you get to
the elevator, go up to the 57th
floor. Pulse in and go onto the
Wave Road using the Wave Station
right by the elevator door. Walk
all the way down the yellow
path, ignoring the blue wave
things until you get to a Blue
Mystery Wave. This is going to
become important later, so best
to grab it now.

Pulse out and walk through the
pink gate thing. Talk to
everyone in here to find out
that the information board on
the bottom floor isn't working
right. You also receive a second
folder from a guy. When you've
talked to everyone, you get a
message from Ace telling you to
go to Satella Police Main HQ.
Take the elevator down to the
first floor and go all the way
to the left.

Ace talks about Dealer and their
plans. After Omega-Xis demands a
battle from Acid and Ace, a
voice calls Ace's name. Hee, his
real name is Arthur. Maybe he's
secretly an aardvark. There's a
very short, very old woman on
the stairs. Turns out she's Dr.
Goodall and has absurd nicknames
for both of the Wizards present.
She shakes her head and says she
isn't sure. She might be able to
save Luna, she might not be able
to.

When it's over and you have
control, talk to Ace. Then go
back to the up to the 57th floor
and talk to the guy who
mentioned a problem with the
board downstairs. He's the one
in the upper corner. Go back
down to the first floor and
pulse into the Wave Station. Go
right along the path until you
can turn left. Step on the blue
wave thing and keep going left
until you get to another blue
wave thing. Go over to the
darkened Access point, which the
WAZA Key you got earlier will
unlock. Trans into the Info
Board.

The first thing about this area
is, it's freaking huge. It's
larger than Bud's ass, if you
believe that's possible. Head
up. When you get to the second
purple rectangle thing, go onto
the right yellow path. Once on
that path, you can literally
hold the up button the entire
way to get to the Mettaur
sprite.

Battle ShuriKenG x 1, Stealth x
1, ZapperG x 1

After that, Ace sends you a
message. Head all the way back
over to the blue area, where Dr.
Goodall has something to tell
you about Luna. Vogue is back
and says Luna is waiting for
everyone. She's now an EM being
and her data is scattered all
over the place. Turns out the
good doctor might be able to fix
Luna if you can get all the
pieces. Ace has to rain on
everyone's good humor, much to
my liking. Dr. Goodall says it
would take a miracle for Luna to
come back, and Vogue points out
that the bonds they all share
with Luna are creating a miracle
and holding her to this world.
After some more inspirational
talking, turns out that even if
everything goes right, there's
only a 30% chance to save Luna.

Jack and Tia are separated.
Looks like Jailbait went off on
a solo mission, and Jack isn't
very happy about it. Go over to
the Wave Liner gate and talk to
the big dude wearing body armor.
He'll take you to Alohaha. It's
now time to search for Luna
Frags. Gah, even when she's dead
she's a total pain in the ass.
Go to the food stall that you
fixed earlier so that Bud could
eat. Tap Acid on the bottom
screen to start searching. He
says one is near, but he doesn't
know where. Go to the food stand
and hit A. You know have
LunaFragA.

Next stop is the beach. Go along
the left edge of the screen
until you're almost at the deep
water. Tap Acid to find the
exact location. The frag will
glow for a moment at the end of
the chime, just before he says
"Target signal... acquired."
That's LunaFragC. Tap Acid again
to find out there's another one
here. Go to the end of the pier.
Tap Acid again when you're
standing next to the Wizard.
When the search is done, talk to
the Wizard. Geo asks him about
the LunaFrag, which he says he
does not have. Acid smells it on
him though, and threatens him a
bit. He hands it over and now
you have LunaFragD. That's it
for the Real World. Time to
check the Wave Roads.

Head over to the Beach Wave
Station and pulse in. Tap Acid
to find out there are none here.
Head to Alohaha. As soon as you
get there, stand on the right
side of the Hertz and tap Acid.
At the end of the chiming, you
should see the LunaFrag glow for
a second. Go get it. That's
LunaFragB. The picture of Luna
on the bottom is nearly done. Go
into the Castle's Wave Road.
Trans into the Island Display
CC.

In here, take the blue wave
thing and walk forward a bit.
You should see a hertz, a Guide
Hertz, and a Mal Wizard. They're
unimportant. Walk to the right
until you see another Mal
Wizard. He is also unimportant.
Keep going right and up until
you see a third Mal Wizard.
Stand next to him and tap Acid.
When the thing is over, talk to
the Mal Wizard. He'll toss a
virus at you. After an easy
battle, you get LunaFragF. One
more to go. Trans out, but don't
pulse out. Go over to the
Environmental Computer and trans
in.

There's a Hertz right when you
walk in. Ignore him and follow
the blue path until you get to a
second Hertz. Stand next to him
and tap Acid. When the search is
over, talk to the Hertz. He
"accidentally" sends some
viruses to you. After the
battle, he gives you the final
LunaFrag.

+----------=====================

Back at WAZA HQ, bad stuff is
happening. There's a black
Omega-Xis looking at Bud
hungrily. Bud runs up to him and
nearly gets gutted. Lyra is the
only one that can see the
obvious: this one is a fake.
Sonia goes Harp Note and saves
everyone. Turns out there's a
ton of fakes, all in various
colors. Alarms go off and
everyone freaks out. Turns out
the Commandos have a secret
weapon just for such an
emergency, but they need Acid to
help get it working so that it
doesn't kill everyone.

Some cool stuff goes on. Ace is
a total badass. Nothing unusual
here. Acid goes back to Ace, and
Geo has to take the Astro Wave
to WAZA. I assume you know how
to get there from here, so get
up on that Astro Wave.

Once in the Astro Wave, a
massive amount of Noise shows
up. Make your way toward Astro
Wave 1. I advise you save before
you actually get into the Astro
Wave, because you're about to
get your Noise Form. Walk into
Astro Wave 1. Cutscene begins
and a comic relief villain from
SF2 appears. He's pissed that
you never read his crappy
scripts, so now he's going to
drown you in Noise. He surrounds
you with viruses, which you now
get to battle.

After the battle, you get your
first Noise Form. It's
completely random, so if you
don't like it and you saved when
I said to, you can reset and get
a new one. The viruses are gone
and Dark Phantom is like HAH
YOU'RE FOLLOWING MY SCRIPT
MWAHAHAHA! Apparently, his
script called for giving you
more power. Odd. Anyway, he
leaves, so walk up to the pink
gate and tap the blue popup to
open it. Follow the two blue
wave things to get to the WAZA
warp.

Harp Note is in trouble. A copy
is about to kill her when Omega-
Xis comes in from nowhere and
backhands it into oblivion. Tia
and Virgo are up on yet another
high place. Damn, their family
isn't at all afraid of heights,
are they? Anywho, more copies
show up and Mega wants to
murderlize them all. Ace tells
Harp Note to go protect the main
computer room, and you get to
stay out here and protect the
wall. When you're ready, tell
Omega-Xis yes, and get to
killing. Some battle Wizards
come out to be bait and keep the
copies away from the wall,
though they can't kill any of
the copies. The object is to run
around and kill all the copies
before they get to the gate.
After you kill a bunch, it shows
Megaman and Omega-Xis killing
one more. Some more copies come
and break down the wall in
seconds.

When you're inside, head for the
blue room. You now need to
defend this area. There's a
catch, though; both this room
and the room up the stairs are
targets so you'll have to run
back and forth between the two.
You'll be told when to switch,
though, so don't just run up and
down. Some more battle Wizards
come in. It's like they have an
infinite number of these things.
After killing a bunch more, the
guys over by the elevator need a
hand. Go over there and help
them.

More copies are on their way.
You know the drill, kill them.
After you kill a ton more, it's
time to go up the elevator. Go
into the command center and
prepare to fight more. Bud Wave
Changes and goes to protect Dr.
Goodall with Harp Note. Time to
kill more clones. There's a lot
more area to protect now, and
they're still coming. Once
they're done, the program is
done. All the copies can now be
killed at once.

All the copies get killed. Tia
Wave Changes into Jailbait
Virgo. Ace then reveals an epic
secret: he can Wave Change too.
He's Transcode 001. You're
Transcode 003. Then who is..
Transcode 002? Dun worry, you'll
find out in a little bit.
Anyway, even Omega-Xis is
impressed by Ace's abilities.
You get a call from Zack, who's
in some trouble because Dark
Phantom showed up. It's now time
to go kick his ass, leaving
Virgo to Ace. Head over to the
elevator and into the main
computer room. Dark Phantom is
there and he wants your Ace
Program. Taurus and Harp stand
up to help fight, and Dr.
Goodall says that all of them
are willing to do what's
necessary to save Luna. Geo Wave
Changes and Dark Phantom flees
like a coward into the computer.

Get to the Wave Station and
pulse in. Follow the path,
ignoring the first blue wave
thing and stepping on the
second. Keep going left here
until you get to the Main
Computer CC Access point. Trans
in.

Take the path near the top of
this big purple rectangle. There
should be a broadcast Hertz
standing there. Go left until
you get to another purple
square, and then up to get to a
rectangle. From there go right
until you get to a big purple
rectangle, and up until you get
to a small purple square. Go
down to another square, right to
an oddly shaped thing, and while
still in the oddly shaped area,
go up until you see a purple
square with another broadcast
Hertz on it. From that square,
go left. Dark Phantom is just
one square away, so save if
you'd like.

Mini Boss Battle: Dark Phantom
Difficulty: Easy Strategy: At
900 HP, he's a step down from
Club. Kill this nubsauce.
Attacks: Phantom Hand: A hand
occasionally pops up in front of
you and tries to hit
      you.  Easy to dodge.
Pimp Cane: Phantom steps in
front of you and hits you with
the cane. Phantom Grab: He stops
and shoots a hand out of his
chest at you. Flamboyance: He
comes up close to you and, uh,
spins around. Use your Y
   Shield to block.

After an absurdly easy
battle(seriously, my final time
was 00:10:30), he goes emo and
leaps to his death. However,
Mega sets up for him to return
in future games by saying he'll
probably come back.

Anyway, you get a message. Go to
the front of HQ. Save
 and then gooutside.
Ace has been dodging without
hitting back, and when Virgo
confronts him about it, accusing
him of going easy, he attacks,
scoring a critical hit for
massive damage. Ace then
collapses. Turns out being Wave
Changed is really bad for his
health because Acid is man-made.
Since Ace can't fight, it's now
up to us to kill Virgo. Er, I
mean, beat Virgo.

Boss Battle: Queen Virgo
Element: Aqua Weakness: Elec
Difficulty: Medium Strategy:
She's got 1200 HP. I hope you
have some Elec cards, because
she can be pretty difficult. If
you can get your Noise up to
200% or above, then enter the
Custom screen, you can Finalize,
which is when you become the
thing on the game cover.
Attacks: Aqua Barrier: Not
really an attack, but it's
something she does. She'll stop
   and create a swrling barrier
   thing that blocks all attacks
   while it's up. If you hit it,
   it will launch a shockwave at
   you.
Aqua Dragon: She slams her staff
down, creating a dragon that
goes down
   every row. It it hits you,
   it'll trap you in a bubble.
Sticky Rain: Exactly like the
cards, except on four panels.
Your Y Shield
   can block this.

Jailbait, in a sort of irony, is
now herself on her way to jail.
They're about to start putting
Luna back together, and seeing
as we still have the LunaFrags,
we kind of need to be there. Go
back to the main computer room.
There's a cutscene, nothing
important happens except Luna's
back. Yay. Because I really
wanted her back. At least now I
don't have to search for those
damn LunaFrags and the two Prez
Pals can stop being emo. You get
the option to save, and this
chapter is now over.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

Heartless and King are plotting.
It involves Jack, who has been
being a very bad boy. King is
all like "I'M AN EVIL MAN BUT
I'M STILL A PARENT MWAHAHAHA LET
HIM BE" about Jack. Back in the
classroom, the three guys are
talking about WAZA and the state
it's in. WAZA is all but
destroyed. And then the
discussion topic changes to Bud,
who apparently has been hiding
something. Zack makes a guess
and is horribly wrong, but we
don't know that yet. Prez comes
in and starts asking Bud about
his secret. Bud runs off and
then Luna turns on Geo and Zack.
She mentions that something
important is going on tomorrow,
but Zack and Geo have no idea
what that something is. Turns
out that tomorrow is the school
election. Luna doesn't remember
being dead at all, but she knows
she was a pain in the ass and
decides not to kill you for
forgetting that tomorrow was a
big day.

Zack comes up with yet another
idiotic theory, and now it's
time to go secure more votes for
Luna. Zack's handling the
students, so it's up to you to
get the teachers on your side.
The Spica Mall Candy Shop is now
open, by the way. Anyway, before
we do anything else, we need
more defensive power. We're
going into a Noise Wave. Pulse
in and go to Bud's house.
Examine his bed to open the
Noise Wave. As Megaman, examine
the Noise Wave to enter it. Keep
going left and up until you see
a BMW. This is an Ability Wave,
and this particular Ability is
Undershirt/60. Now, if you have
more than 1 HP and get hit by an
attack that does more damage
than you have HP, it'll reduce
you to 1 instead.

Leave the Noise Wave through the
large hole that's on the bottom
of the far left side. Anyway,
back to the story, go to the
Science Club Room and talk to
the large generic man sprite
known as the teacher Damon Crow.
Now go to the first floor and
talk to the man in the snack
shop. Go up to the second floor
to see Mr. Shepar, who
completely ignores your greeting
and tells you to go help the
gardener. Go up to the roof to
find out that the new gardener
is none other than Damian Wolfe.
Pulse in, get on the Wave Road,
and trans into the sprinkler. In
the very center, where the
tutorial viruses were, there's a
Noise cluster. When the viruses
are gone, the Noise cluster also
vanishes. Then you walk away and
when you trans out, the Noise
returns.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

A cutscene occurs in which King
is an ass to Jack. Heartless
discusses some plot-relevant
items. Jack walks away and
starts scheming. He wants to
bust his sister out of jail, but
first he wants to deal with
Megaman. When that's over,
you're back at school, just
outside the Sprinkler. Pulse out
and go talk to Damian Wolfe. Go
back to the second floor, go
into the classroom, and speak to
that bossy witch. She has more
for you to do.

You get a message from Ace. He
wants to meet you in the Main
Computer CC. Leave the school,
go over to the Wave Station
outside Geo's house, and make
your way to the Astro Wave. Go
to WAZA, get to the Wave Station
once you're there. Go up the
stairs, up the elevator, and use
the Wave Station to get onto the
Wave Road. Get to the Access
point and trans in. Make your
way to the back, where you
fought Dark Phantom, and save
before you step onto the big
square at the end. It's time to
fight Ace.

Mini Boss Battle: Acid Ace
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: Moderate Strategy:
Only 800 HP, but he's got enough
attacks to be a pain. And he's
pretty fast, so even if you lock
on, you still might not hit him
Attacks: MechFlame: Exactly like
the card. He shoots fire
forward. Wide Wave: Exactly like
the card. A three-panel wide
water blast. Sqall: Exactly like
the card. It's a tornado.
StealthLaser: Exactly like the
card. He shoots lasers.
GroundWave: Exactly like the
card. It'll change direction
once. Buzz Saw : Exactly like
the card. Seriously, he has no
original moves. DoubleSlash: An
original move. Sort of. If
ripping off Protoman counts as
   an original move. He locks on
   and slashes twice with his
   sword.
Ace Laser: An original move. He
fires a laser down all three
columns.
 Use the Y Shield to block it.
Wing Blade: An original move. He
dashes down a column, his wings
damaging
   the column on either side.
   You can block if on the
   columns hit by the wings, but
   not on the one hit by the
   body.


Yeah, he wasn't all that hard.
Harp Note and Taurus Fire show
up. Turns out Ace was battling
you as part of a test. You're
now a Satella Police Commando
along with Ace and the other
two. Bud's real secret is that
he's been training with Ace
every day to get stronger. Turns
out there WAZA HQ is still
pretty messed up. They now need
to rely on children with super
powers to save the world, as if
that isn't what's been going on
for two games. At least this
game actually has the kids join
the law enforcement, unlike BN
which just had them as ordinary
kids throught six games.

Ace comes up with a cool Purpose
that Omega-Xis likes, but no one
other than those two like it.
Ace reluctantly changes it to
"Foil Dealer Plan", which for
some reason the rest of them
like better. Ace becomes your
Brother, so whoo, more LP for
you. 100 LP more, holy crap
that's a lot. Sonia, Bud, Luna,
and Zack all only gave 60. Ace
then drops the mental bomb on
us: If we don't fulfill our
Purpose, the world could be
destroyed. Good bye, happy
atmosphere, we'll miss you. A
generic Commando sprite reports
into Ace, saying that the
mysterious other member
declined, and then he falls to
one knee because said other
member beat him up. He then runs
off to go get his ass kicked
again.

ALARMS ARE GOING OFF. Turns out
there's some bad stuff going
down in Echo Ridge. Some viruses
have appeared in the Real World.
Looks like the newly formed
special division of the
Commandos are about to get their
first mission as a Team. Leave
the building and use the outside
Wave Station to enter the Wave
Road. Go up to the Astro Wave
and head toward Echo Ridge.
There's some Noise blocking the
path. With some help from Taurus
and Harp Note, the Noise is
removed. Keep going and there
will be even more Noise. Kill
it.

When you finally get to the Echo
Ridge warp, go down to the Wave
Station and go over to the park.
Luna and Zack are trapped by
viruses. There's a three-round
virus battle. They save the day,
some random talking, blah blah
blah. There's virus activity in
WBG studios. Head over there
now. We're nearly to a part of
the game that a ton of people
post stupid help topics about,
just so you know. Anyway, go to
the Wave Station and get
yourself to the Astro Wave.

There's an assload of Noise when
you first get there. It forms a
big door. Your buster doesn't
even affect it, and Prez calls
you with bad news. Echo Ridge
isn't as safe as you so naively
thought when you ran into space.
Since you can't continue through
the Astro Wave anyway, looks
like you get to help the good
people of Echo Ridge. Step on
the warp. There's a cutscene,
Noise Waves are explained, and
Geo and Mega volunteer to
explore one. Much fun.

When you're back on control,
examine that thing to go inside.
If you've been following this
guide to the letter, you've been
in a Noise Wave before, if you
haven't, I'm not going to
explain. Once you're inside,
head right and go up to the
Noise Hertz. From the Noise
Hertz, go up and then left until
you can see another Noise Wave
exit. You end up in WBG studios,
where Taurus and Harp are having
issues with the rapidly-
regenerating viruses.

First up is Taurus. Go up to the
tennis court, and watch the
bottom screen. When it starts to
get all buggy, face toward the
viruses and press A to reveal
another Noise Wave. Where you
appear is generated randomly, so
look around for a Noise Hertz
who says he's in a practice
match. To the right of him is a
Noise cluster. Examine it and
it'll be destroyed. Then go back
to the Noise Hertz who's in a
practice match and go up to get
to the exit.

Yay, the viruses here are gone.
Time to save Sonia. Get over to
where she is and go to the end
of that mini-pier. Examine the
pond from there to find out that
the Noise Wave is hidden there.
It looks like your spawn point
in this Noise Wave is fixed, so
go right to find the Noise
cluster. Once it's gone, go back
to the spawn point and head
downward to the exit.

Message from Harp Note. Big
Noise Wave over in the Event
Stage, request immediate backup.
Go to the event stage and find
the other two. They're facing a
tree, so examine it to find the
Noise Wave. Just wander around a
bit until a cutscene begins.
They're a freaking huge Noise
Cluster and then, as if things
weren't bad enough, Jack comes
in. Turns out this whole thing
was his doing. Just as he's
about to waste you, a cold voice
sounds. A really big axe/sword
thing comes in and nearly
decapitates Jack, and then the
resident badass, Rogue, shows
up. Since Burai sounds cooler, I
am going to refer to him as
Burai from now on. Got it?

Turns out he has a grudge
against Dealer. Jack runs like a
coward, Megaman thanks Burai for
helping, and of course gets
turned down. He says to tell the
Satella Police that he won't
work with them, but will at most
use them as a tool. The Noise
vanishes on its own, much to
Megaman's suprise. Now it's time
to find the exit. From the spot
where the cutscene occurred, go
down and left. From there you
should see the exit. Time to go
back to HQ.

Since you can't take the Wave
Liner to WAZA HQ yet, take it to
Echo Ridge. Go to the Astro
Wave. Once on the Astro Wave,
get to WAZA HQ. Go over to the
blue stairs. A cutscene will
begin at the bottom.

Hee, Burai was supposed to be
the final member of the team.
However, he's too badass for
such things, so he beat the crap
out of the officer that was sent
to recruit him. There's also a
cutscene at Dealer HQ. Looks
like Jack stole a very important
program. King is finally almost
mad enough to order a hit on
Jack, so he has Joker watch over
Jack. If Jack goes just the
tiniest bit overboard, Joker is
to delete him with extreme
prejudice. Dude, that's like,
filicide or something.

When the cutscene is over, leave
the HQ. Holy crap, Solo is
there. That nubtart police
officer that got his ass kicked
shows up, still chasing Solo.
Solo gets so annoyed, he agrees
to join... if the police can
catch him. A ton of comic relief
police Wizards show up, and then
get killed by Solo's Wizard,
Laplace, who is also a total
badass. A lot more comic relief
police Wizards show up, only to
get owned by Laplace again.
Except this time, Solo had
Laplace turn into that badass
sword/axe thing. Turns out
Dealer is using stolen
technology from Mu, and even
mentioning Mu is usually enough
to get on Solo's hit list. Damn,
I feel sorry for Dealer now.

Once he leaves, you get an
e-mail. You can now do a Help
quest which will unlock a WAZA
Wave Liner pass, so you can ride
the Wave Liner to WAZA. To save
time, we should do that now. Go
back inside and up to the 57th
floor. Talk to the girl nearest
the Main Computer area, and tap
her Help popup to start. She
wants some ice cream. Not just
any ice cream either, she wants
ice cream from Spica Mall. Say
you'll buy her some ice cream
and then go to the Astro Wave.

Make your way to Alohaha or Echo
Ridge. It doesn't really matter
which. When you arrive, take the
Wave Liner to Spica Mall. Go to
the candy shop and get some ice
cream from the large freezer
labeled "IE CREAM." You now have
three minutes to get back to
WAZA HQ Command Center.
GOGOGOGOGOGO.

You should get there with over a
minute to spare. I took the Wave
Liner to Echo Ridge, Astro Wave
to WAZA, and then just ran up
the elevator. I had 1:40:00 left
on the clock. You spent 50 Zenny
on her ice cream, and then she
gives you 1000 Zenny. Damn, she
really wanted that ice cream.
She also gives you the Wave
Liner ID.

Now that that's over with, take
the Wave Liner to Echo Ridge. Go
to your house and talk to your
mom. She's freaking out because
there were viruses everywhere
and she had no idea where he
was. He pulls some more bs
straight out the ass and she
buys it. Go to your room and
sleep, you liar you.

Morning, and your mom is waking
you up. Geo is dreaming about
food, for some odd reason. Since
he wasn't getting up, she was
about to get in bd with him, but
he sat up and scared the crap
out of her. It's election day
and Prez is pissed at you for
oversleeping. Go to school and
talk to Luna as soon as you get
inside. She's going to be
holding a special meeting, so
she wants you to go get Bud and
Zack, then join her on the roof.

GO to the 2nd floor and enter
the classroom. YAY! SONIA IS
HERE! And holy crap, so is Solo.
Solo is just here waiting for
Jack, who will probably be
attacking the election. While
Geo is explaining that that's
not how you do things, Jack
shows up, according to Solo. Cut
to the roof, where all of the
candidates are giving their
speeches to a crowd of generic
sprites. It's now Luna's turn,
and since she's the only
candidate not using a generic
sprite, she gets the most
cheers.

Jack then appears. He's about to
torch the building in order to
get Geo to come out. Wolf and
Wolfe are over on the other side
of the elevator, just watching
the scene unfold. Wolfe wants to
fight him, and Wolf points out
that there's no way they can
win. Wolfe doesn't intend to
win, he just wants to hold
Corvus off long enough to give
Geo time to get there. Luna has
to be all badass and command
Corvus to stop. She then walks
up to the edge of the building,
and Jack kind of freaks out
because he saw her get nailed by
a fully charged laser, yet she's
somehow alive. A tone more dark
flames appear, and all of a
sudden there's a large blue wolf
standing near the stage.

You're still in the class room,
and the sheer amount of Noise in
the area is keeping the doors
held shut. Geo's about to smash
down the door when Solo proves
that he really just doesn't care
about causing some destruction
here and there. After scaring
the crap out of Zack, he calls
in Laplace and has him become
that awesome sword/axe blade
thing. He cuts a massive hole in
the floor and leaps down it,
heading for the Wave Station.
Time to follow.

Because the creators didn't feel
like creating a new room that
was only going to be used once,
the game mentions that you're
now in the faculty room and see
another hole in the wall. You
then end up in the hallway of
the first floor. Because Bud and
Sonia don't have a sexy Ace
Program like you, the Noise
prevents them from going
further. Head over to the Wave
Station and enter the Wave Road.
Start up the ramp. Burai,
apparently, has far too much
badass to be affected by simple
Noise, so he just walks right on
in.

This isn't like normal Noise
Waves. There's no exit. The only
way out is to kill the huge
beast made of Noise that
appears. To do this, you must
play a simple minigame. It's
pretty fun. Use the D-Pad to
move the cursor, and press B to
fire at the spot the cursor is
on. IF you fail to delete all
the little Noise bits fast
enough, to you get hit by them.
Three hits and you have to start
over. Once you destroy all the
little bits, Burai will fly over
to it and slash it with Laplace.

When it's dead, head up the ramp
to the second floor. When you
get there, there's another Noise
Wave, so prepare to play the
minigame again. This time it's
green and takes more hits to
kill. When it's dead, head
toward the roof to find yet
another Noise Wave. This one is
blue and takes more hits to kill
than the green. Keep going up
the ramps when it's dead until
you get to the final Noise Wave.
This one is purple and again,
stronger than the last one.
Burai slashes it multiple times
with Laplace and it still isn't
dead, so Geo charges his
Megabuster and nails it,
finishing it off. Burai gets
pissed and pulses out of the
Noise Wave. When you get back on
the Wave Road, you should save,
because it's time to fight
Burai. Walk over toward the warp
and he'll appear to kick your
ass.

Mini Boss Battle: Burai Element:
None Weakness: None Difficulty:
Medium Strategy: 1000 HP. But
he's fast and can use statuses.
All I can really say is do your
best to dodge and hit him with
your strongest cards. That's
really just the strategy for
every boss. A good strategy,
however, would be to use cards
that break panels, because he
can get trapped by them. If you
fill your folder with a ton of
Normal Standard cards, you can
raise your Noise up to 200% and
access the Meteor Server, which
will give you access to powerful
cards. Attacks: 3-Hit Combo: He
warps in front of you and hits
you three times. Rogue Break: He
jumps in front of you and slams
Laplace down, breaking two
   panels.
RocketPunch: He stops in the
middle row and fires punches at
you. They cause
     Confusion if they hit.
LaplaceSlap: Similar to the
BeastSlap card, he slashes
Laplace in a 3x2 range
    and does multiple hits.

Step into the warp and go up to
the roof. Wolfe was getting his
ass kicked, so he's relieved
when Megaman shows up to lighten
his load. It's now time for a
boss battle.

Boss Battle: Jack Corvus
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Difficulty: Moderate Strategy:
1400 HP. And weak to Aqua. If
you have Queen Virgo and/or
Diamond Ice, put it in to make
it easier. Mainly use Aqua.
Score some critical hits for
massive damage. Attacks: Summon
Ghost: Purple ghosts fly down
the columns and try to get you.
Wicked Blade: He goes two
squares in front of you and
tries to cut you. Wicked Flame:
He flies up in the air and
starts raining down purple
flames

that crack the panels he hits.
CorvusTunnel: He flies in from a
direction. The only way to avoid
this is
   to dodge it by going to the
   far left or far right panel.
   The panels he's going to hit
   will flash red before he
   actually
attacks, so it's easy to dodge.

Whoo, Jack is now dead. Or at
least, covered in explosions. He
collapses to the ground when he
stops exploding, and Joker
leaves. Time to announce the
election results, and as
predicted, the winner was the
only non-generic sprite that
ran. You get the option to save
when it's all over.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

King is laughing because his
victory is now all but assured.
He's destroyed every WAZA HQ in
the world and Meteor G is now
under almost under his complete
control. Joker has an idea, and
Joker's ideas are never fun.
This is not going to be fun.

When that's over, you're in
Geo's room, and he babbles for a
bit. Leave your room and talk to
your mom. She's worried because
she thinks you're going to go
into space, turn into an EM
being, and get stranded for
years. When she's done, leave
the house.

Holy giant hair, Batman, Luna's
stalking you again! She's all
excited as she fantasizes about
her dictatorial reign as student
body president, and then she
starts referring to herself in
the third person. And now she
wants to hear people praisisng
her. ANd out of nowhere, she
starts singing. WHAT THE HELL,
WOMAN?!?!?! And drooling.
Seriously. Vogue points out that
Geo is watching her, and she
completely snaps out of it. Time
to go to class.

Speaking of class, what are we
going to do about the two
massive holes Solo left? Walk
into school to find out...
they're gone. Huh. Mr. Shepar
says something like "HAHAHA
THERE WAS A HOLE THERE BUT I
FIXED IT." <_< I don't know
about you, but I'm pretty sure
it would take more than twelve
hours to fix a hole the size of
a truck. Anyway, once you're in
the classroom, talk to Luna, who
has somehow beat you here. She
wants you to be her spy now. As
if helping her get elected,
saving her life, and then
bringing her back to life wasn't
enough, she now wants you to spy
for her. This game takes
Alchemy's first law of
equivalent exchange and
completely shoves it down the
trash can.

Go around and talk to everyone
in the room. Then class begins
and there's an empty seat. Hee,
the teacher asks Bud to solve a
problem that doesn't involve
food. Zack tries to help him,
but Bud is still lost. Bud falls
asleep. Dude must have
narcolepsy or something.
Everyone, including Geo, laughs
at Bud, and Shepar tells Geo to
solve it. Geo, being the lucky
bastard that he is, is saved by
an announcement that a Wizard is
going out of control. Go down to
the main lobby.

Two Wizards are engaged in an
epic battle to the death. Geo
pulses in and tries to break up
the fight. They both turn on
him, and now it's time to
battle. Defeated, they return to
normal, and some Crimson
appears. You get a call from a
generic male police sprite, and
he tells you that Spica Mall is
now out of control. Time to go
over there. Take the Wave Liner.

When you get there, you get a
call saying there are three out-
of-control Wizards. Only one is
in the Real World. Pulse in and
head to the T-shaped area. You
should see the Wizard before you
get to him. Talk to him as
Megaman and a fight will begin.
Defeated, he spawns some
Crimson. Go over to the Wave
Station and pulse into the Wave
Road. Head over to the Access
point that's to the left of the
Wave Station. Trans into the
Dentist's CC, then head left and
step on the blue wave thing.
Step into the warp on the other
side of the blue wave thing.
Follow the path to the next
area, which is the Candy Store
Wave Road. Go all the way around
the left path until you get to
the Gum Ball Machine CC.

Head all the way to the left.
There's a red Wizard here. Kill
him, more Crimson appears. Trans
and pulse out. Pulse back in and
this time, go to the right, to
the Event stage. Make your way
to the Spimo the Cat statue and
trans in. All the way in the top
left part of the X is the third
and final Wizard of Spice Mall.
KEEL HEEM. When he's dead, you
get a call telling you to go to
WAZA HQ. Trans and pulse out,
then head to the Wave Liner
wicket. Take it to WAZA HQ.

Once there, go inside and talk
to the generic policeman sprite
standing near the octagonal
desk. Then go toward the blue
room. Talk to Ace when you see
him to be magically warped to
the Command Center. Mr. Boreal
starts talking about Crimson,
elaborating more on its use and
formation. Turns out that
there's a thing inside Meteor G
that spoke to Aaron. Ace then
says that Dealer was behind the
incident, even though there's no
evidence at all to support it.
Ace then reveals the Meteor G is
made of Noise. Then all the
lights go out. Someone, or
something, used some super
stoner hacker powers to break
into WAZA HQ. And that someone
is King. I can easily sum up
King's speech in a few words.
"THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS."

Out of control Wizards are now
all over WBG Studios. Take the
Wave Liner. When you arrive, go
to the Event Stage. There's a
freaking huge orgy going on
here. At least, that's what it
looks like. Through some sort of
magic, Ace and Geo manage to
take down all of the Wizards.
That, or they collapsed from
sheer exhaustion. Wow. An
assload of Crimson shows up.
However, it doesn't fly off like
usual. Acid tells them to look
up, and

HOLY CRAP.

That freakishly large Laserman
copy is standing there. He holds
up a big thermos and all of the
Crimson flies into it. Ace leaps
over a tall stage in a single
bound, on his way to kicking
Joker's ass. Ace tries to cut
him, but Joker is feeling pretty
sirius and dodges. Joker is now
somehow behind Ace. The big guy
is feeling pretty confident and
holds up a single hand, which
begins glowing red. When the
Noise level hits 200%, Acid
Finalizes, and Acid Ace becomes
Acid Illegal. Or, in America,
Acid Arrest. Joker tells him to
do what he wants, and the first
thing he wants to do is kill
Joker. Ace then turns on you.
Battle time.

Boss Battle: Acid Illegal
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: Impossible Strategy:
Don't get hit. This fight is
impossible, as you can't damage
him.
  Just last
long enough. That should be
easy, though, as his attacks are
all easy to dodge.

Attacks:
Same as Acid Ace.

Ace and Acid are back to normal.
Well, back to what passes as
normal for them. At least,they
appear to be, until they pass
out. A (hardly) mysterious voice
tells Laplace to track Joker.
Back at WAZA, Dr. Goodall is
telling Geo that Ace is pretty
banged up. SO banged up, in
fact, she's surprised he's
actually alive. Ace then walks
in, apparently to prove her
wrong, until he falls to one
knee. It's time to take down
Dealer by striking their base.

Geo is ordered to go home and
sleep. And in a minorly barf-
inducing moment, that old chief
guy turns to Dr. Goodall and
says "There are some thing only
adults can do, isn't that
right?" or something like that.
I mean, seriously, ew. Anyway,
you have to obey orders, so go
home. When you get there, talk
to your mom. She got a call from
your teacher that said you left
school early. Now, I know what
you're expecting, you think Geo
is going to pull some more bs
straight out the ass again, but
nope, Omega-Xis handles it this
time. Now that that's over, go
to bed. Save if you wish.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

Geo's dreaming about food again.
Omega-Xis wakes him up for a
phone call. She starts babbling
about how much she used to sleep
when she was young. Geo get her
back on track, though. She wants
you to investigate three places.
The three sites if Wizard
attacks, in fact. And she wants
you to investigate WBG Studios
last. They're probably still
cleaning up from the Wizard orgy
and don't want Geo seeing that.
Anywho, Dealer's been using
Noise waves to get around, so
she wants you to investigate.

This is the part that spawns 20
topics a day on the boards.
Finding the Noise Waves and
locating Dealer's base. First
area: Echo Ridge Elementary.
Head over there, pulse in when
you enter, and examine the
principal's statue that's in the
main lobby. From where you
enter, go up and then right. Geo
down a bit, and right until you
see a Wizard. Start a battle.
When it's over, talk to him.
Turns out he picked up some
weird data. He gives you the
first piece of the Dealer Access
Key. Now head back to the exit
and leave.

Up next is Spica Mall. Take the
Wave Liner to get there. Once
there, go to the Hunter VG ad
that's on the wall. Examine it
to reveal a Noise Wave. Pulse in
and enter it. Inside this Noise
Wave, there's a Noise Hertz
that's singing a Michael Jackson
song. Hilarious. Anyway, wander
around until you find a Mal
Wizard. It's in the top-right
part of the area, so it
shouldn't take too long. Talk to
him to find out he wants a
Cannon card. If you can give him
one, he'll give you the second
piece of the code. If you can't
because you put it in a card
trader, that sucks. You'll have
to go to the Big Wave Store and
see if the Bargain Bin sells
them. If it doesn't, you'll have
to wait a day for the contents
to change. Go down to the exit.

Now go to the candy shop. Next
to the ice cream bin is a video
game. Press A on it to reveal,
you guessed it, a Noise Wave.
Enter it. In here is a hilarious
quiz guy. All he says at first
is "...'Sup?" Choose yes. Yay,
he's a Quiz Noise! He wants you
to guess his favorite color. The
answer is yellow. Next question
is about Sonia. Which item was
stolen from her? Pick bag. Final
question: How many times has he
said "sup"? Type in 7 and hit
OK. He gives you the fourth
piece, but it isn't the last one
you need as you don't have the
third yet. The exit is visible
from right there, so leave the
Noise wave and head to the mall
event area.

Go to the very top and examine
the stage lights. There's a
Noise Wave here. Enter it. Look
around for a Noise Hertz. He
should be in the middle left
part of the area. He gives you
the final piece of the access
key. Find the exit and leave.
Now that you have the whole key,
it's time to go to WBG studios.
Go to the event stage. When you
first enter, there's a guard
Wizard looking at a blank wall.
Examine that wall to find the
final Noise Wave that leadds to
Dealer base. You needed the
Access key to open this Noise
Wave, so now that you have it,
it's open.

From here, head down. Go over
until you see a Noise Hertz. Go
down a bit and right some more.
Go down, then right, then down
to the black area. Go left from
the black area until the Noise
Hertz you see is on the right
edge of your screen. Then go
down all the way and right until
you see a Noise Hertz. Go down,
right, down, left, and you
should see the exit. Whoo, you
found Dealer's base. Looks like
this place has some crazy sort
of shielding on it that makes it
so the only way you could
possibly detect it is by seeing
it directly.

After he goes and makes a quick
call for backup, just walk
around a but until a cutscene
starts. Ace shows up Acid,
Sonia, Lyra, and an army of
generic police sprites. Ace says
that this may be the last chance
you get to stop Dealer, so you'd
better do your best. He then
changes the Purpose to Crush
Dealer, which I like better than
Foil Dealer Plan. Ace wants you
to pulse in and unlock the door,
so hop to it. Go down two ramps
until you see a Wave Station.
Pulse in and go onto the Wave
Road. Head in the direction of
the door, grabbing the BMW you
see on the way.

From the BMW containing the
Dealer Key, ust hold Right on
the d-pad until you get to the
Noise Hertz. Then go down,
right, and up until you get to a
blue wave thing. Step on it and
trans into the King Wall CC on
the other side.

Once inside, go right and up
until you get to the back of the
area, where a MalWizard is
standing at a control panel.
Speak to him to initiate battle.
When he's dead, he'll explode
and Geo will unlock the door.
Trans out, pulse out, and head
back to where Ace is.

Inside, there is a ton of
Crimson. At least a ton. If not
a few tons. To foil Dealer's
plan, we need to destroy that
hugeass tank of Noise. All of
the generic police sprites pull
out laser weapons and start
shooting at it. It does some
sort of thing and nails them
all, forcing them to drop to
their knees. It then tries to
murderlize Geo and Sonia, but
the redshirt army is able to
push them out of the way in
time. Somehow, two ten year olds
and one 17 year old manage to
drag six well-muscled police
people out of the way of the
giant machine.

Walk left until you get to a
Wave Station. Pulse into the
Wave Road and just hold Down on
the D-pad unt you leave the area
and go back into Secret Shelter.
Then go right until the path
curves aroun back into the
Crimson Factory. The road in
here is fragmented, similar to
Cygnus and Gemini's scenarios in
SF1. In order to fix it, you
have to trans into the Crimson
Machine, so go ahead.

Run up until you see a Noise
Hertz. He'll explain card
flipping. This first one is
simple, just run down the row.
I'll be using pictures for the
upcoming puzzles, because
they're a lot harder than that
one. Follow the path until
you're at the next puzzle.
Solution: http://img513.imagesha
ck.us/img513/6383/secondcrmsnmac
h.png From there, keep going.
The path only branches a few
times and they're dead ends, so
it's not hard to figure out what
path to take. Here's the
solution for the next puzzle:

http://img172.imageshack.us/img1
72/2933/thirdcrmsnmach.png Keep
going. Here's the fourth: http:/
/img164.imageshack.us/img164/749
4/fourthcrmsnmach.png Go along
the short path. A cage comes out
of nowhere and traps you. Is
this the end for our heroes? I
think not, as Harp Note comes in
and saves you. You trans out
automatically, leaving her to
suffer in the Noise.

Anyway, the Wave Road is fixed.
Head into the second Crimson
Machine area. Follow the path to
the first puzzle. Solution: http

://img338.imageshack.us/img338/2
172/seventhcrmsnmach.png After
that puzzle, you should see a
BMW containing a Mega Weapon.
This is the Titan Glove. With 5
Attack, it's a lot better than
the starting bust, which I was
still using because I didn't
feel like picking up any others.
I don't even need a picture for
the next one because it's just a
simple run through.

Time for the next area. Still
pretty straightforward. First
puzzle: http://img264.imageshack

imageshack.us/img56/8809/finalcr
msnmach.png Now, just follow the
path. Yeah, there is another set
of cards, but it's another one
of those just walk through kind
of things.

Holy snap, this entire machine
is run using technology stolen
from Mu. You're about to get
murderlized by the machine, when
all of a sudden, a voice from
nowhere sounds and you're fine.
You shoot the machine, it
deactivates, and you
automatically trans out. Before
you get control, the camera goes
left to show Laplace in blade
form sticking out of the
machine. That's right, Solo just
saved your ass. Anywho, follow
the path until you get to
another Wave Station. Step on
the teleport spot to go back
down to the ground. Walk through
the door.

Cool, Dealer's base. Ace comes
in and tells you to stay there.
Heh, no. I advise saving before
you go up the stairs. Battle
time.

Boss Battle: Acid Illegal
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: Medium Strategy:
Pretty freaking awesomely, you
can actually damage him this
time.

Attacks:
Same as Acid Ace.

Afterward, it looks like Ace was
in control the whole time. At
least, that's how it looks until
he slashes you in the stomach in
a fit of rage. At least, you
think he did it in a fit of
rage, when he really did it so
you'd stay there and not get
owned by Joker. When you get
control, save again and head up
the stairs. Turns out Acid and
Joker were made from the same
program and that the weird black
Acid Ace is actually Acid's
Finalized form. Joker then
Finalizes and it's time to
battle him.

Boss Battle: Dread Joker
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: Kinda Hard Strategy:
Uh, he has 1600 HP. That's
beastly. Add in that he has one
attack that's nearly
undodgeable, and you have
yourself some pain. Dodge all
the attacks that you can, unload
your most powerful combos on him
in between his attacks, and hope
he doesn't murderlize you.

Attacks: Dread Architecture: He
punches the ground,
materializing some awesome
obelisk
     things.
Joker Missiles: He starts
shooting a freaking ton of
missiles at you. A
     pretty hard to dodge
     attack, as you can block
     it, but your shield will
     expire before he's done
     shooting.
Terrorism: A huge bomb appears.
It hits the entire field and
deals
        Breaking damage.
I Know Kung Fu: He charges a
bit, then appears in front of
you and starts
     kicking like a madman. It's
     kind of funny.
Dread Ballerina: He, uh, kinda
dances. He stands in one place
and twirls
     a bit. Use your Y Shield
     for this attack.

Joker reverts to normal after
the fight. He and his oddly
potato-shaped head are done.
Harp Note shows up, and oddly
enough, Heartless was betting on
you, instead of Joker. Most
interesting. She snaps her
fingers and giant playing card
materializes, carrying King and
her a few feet into the air.
Jack and Jailbait show up out of
nowhere. King starts chuckiling
as Jack tells him that Dealer is
done. Oh snap, not only is Joker
not defeated, he's got his
insane teleportation powers
back. This does not bode well
for our heroes. Especially when
he starts charging up Noise for
a self-destruct. Ace has a
crowning moment of awesome as he
Finalizes and takes on Joker,
absorbing the Noise into
himself.

As he explodes, there's a lovely
little scene between Tia and
Ace. I suppose shippers of this
pair are going to use a
ridiculous name like Tiace or
some other silly thing. There is
a massive amount of Crimson. So
much, in fact, that the ordinary
Crimson sprites just weren't
dramatic enough, so they made
them bigger. You get the option
to save.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

It looks like Acid and Ace are
now dead. OR ARE THEY? A quick
examination of your Save Screen
will reveal that Ace's Brother
Band is still there. Do not
worry, however, Ace is less of a
pain than Luna, so no going
around collecting AceFrags.

Cutscene on the school roof.
Everyone's sad that Ace is gone.
Geo actually starts crying. He
falls to his hands and knees and
starts crying. He didn't cry
when Luna died, and he certainly
didn't fall to the ground,
sobbing hysterically. Proof that
Geo doesn't like Luna as much as
her fans would like to think.
Omega-Xis tells Geo to man up,
and Luna goes hypocritical when
she tells them all they need to
just shut up. FOLLOW YOUR OWN
ADVICE AND MAYBE WE'LL FOLLOW
SUIT. >:(

Anywho, time to go home. Leave
the school building and a
cutscene will begin. Heartless
and King are in a cool looking
lair. Now that Meteor G is under
his total control, King has
decided to make his plan known.
We get a look at what's going on
around the world. Looks like
Strong is back to his old self.
King then fires a FRICKING HUGE
LASER BEAM from his moon base.
National WAZA HQ is now covered
in little red rectangles. Talk
to your four friends to begin a
cutscene.

Dr. Goodall was munched by the
Jamming. Time to go to WAZA and
save her. Step onto the Wave
Liner thing and go to WAZA HQ.
Mega starts bragging about his
strength and then comes out and
starts hitting the Jamming. This
part is pretty simple. Pulse in
and enter the Noise Wave on the
far left. Keep going right once
you're in there. Virus battle.
Once it's done, the two of you
pulse out. Talk to Dr. Goodall.
Everything has been transferred
to Alohaha. Go there, go to the
castle, head toward the back.

So yeah, the Castle's computer
is apparently the only one
powerful enough to do all the
stuff that WAZA's did. Looks
like WAZA is now ant-Meteor G.
Dr. Goodall reminds you that you
have a mother, who is probably
worried sick that you're dead in
a ditch somewhere. Anyway, cut
to the Orbital Base, where King
is complaining that something is
weakening Meteor G's Jamming.
Heartless points out that it's
under his complete control, so
if he's telling it full power,
it should be using full power.
King realizes there must be
someone outside of WAZA screwing
with him. He tells Heartless to
look into it.

Once you get control, time to go
home. If you'll notice, Solo is
standing to the right of the
stairs that lead up to the
castle. You can now battle Burai
whenever you want. Completely
optional. Go to Echo Ridge and
go into Geo's house. Your mom
is, stereotypically as usual, in
the kitchen. She goes into angst
mode pretty quickly, tells you
how much she worries... and then
goes back to the kitchen. You
then get a message from

OMG

ACE

HE'S ALIVE WHO SAW THAT COMING?

Oh, it's just a message telling
you he's gone from this world.
Notice he didn't use the word
"dead." There's also a WingBlade
Giga-class card attached to the
email. Geo completely disregards
everything his mother just said
to him and decides to fight
anyway. Go to your room, go to
bed, save if you want.

Geo's now angsting in his
dreams. Oh lord. Joker comes in
and says it like it is, and then
gives you advice on how not to
be a wuss. And then Acid Ace
shows up and pulls some reverse
angst. And then your dad comes
in. What is this, a seance? Oh,
and look at that manly stubble.
Geo wakes up and wonders if that
was a dream. Of course it wasn't
a dream. Three supposed dead
people just pop into real life
all the time.

Anyway, once you're awake,
Boreal calls you. He wants you
to watch tv. When you get
control, leave your room. Hell
yes, Lee used his super stoner
hacker moves to broadcast a
message around the world. He
then gives a badass speech that
wouldn't be out of place at the
rebel alliance meeting. Belle is
really only on the screen
because Ice felt she wasn't
getting adequate screentime, so
as usual she has absolutely
nothing to contribute to the
plot. Crap, King saw the
message.

HOLY LASER BEAMS OF DEATH. A
freaking HUGE laser floods WBG
Studios with Jamming. Holy hell.
Looks like we need to go save
Lee and Belle. Through some
magic, the tv shuts itself off.
I'm liking this future
technology. Geo shouts that he
needs to go help the Studio, but
his mom was lurking in the
kitchen as usual, so she heard
you. Geo tells her that there's
something he has to do that no
one else can. Hope then has a
flashback. Turns out Geo is
almost a carbon copy of his dad.
Perhaps that's why there's only
one bedroom. Hope has
subconsciously replace Kelvin
with Geo in her mind, and is
using Geo for everything she
once got from Kelvin.

Once you get control, go to WBG
Studios. Go up the street, up
the stairs, and to the building.
Which looks like it's covered in
Alpha's vomit. Omega-Xis is just
mentioning that how unfortunate
it is that there's no one who
can tell you how many people are
trapped in WBG Studios. Cue the
call from Aaron Boreal. Isn't it
amazing how everything in Geo's
life just seems to fall into
place? Looks like Belle and Lee
are trapped, and super stoner
hacker powers aren't going to
get them out of this one.

Mega comes and rips the wall a
new one. Or rather, three new
ones. Pulse in and enter the
middle Noise Wave. Go right to
find Belle. Talk to Belle and
then leave. Enter the far left
Noise Wave and find Lee. Yay,
they're safe. Geo... wow. And
then more copies show up. Battle
time. Hmm. We're now out of
ideas involving Dealer and
finding them. Cue the shady
email intended to further the
plot.

When you get control back, go to
Echo Ridge, pulse in, and make
your way to the Astro Wave. Keep
going into Astro Wave 2, where
there's a gate blocking the
path. There's also a guy
standing there, looking, uh...
flamboyant. He's holding up
traffic. Battle him.

Mini Boss Battle: Moon Destroyer
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: What difficulty?
Strategy: Oh wow. Ooooooooh wow.
  This guy is easy. Easier than
  easy. Kill him. He
is quite possibly the easiest
boss in this entire game. He is
to this game what Gutsman was to
the entire Battle Network
series. His attacks are easy to
dodge, his counter frame is
glaringly obvious to spot, he
moves slower than molasses in
snow, and he's bright yellow.
Seriously, this is an easy
S-Rank.

Attacks: I'm not going to lie,
this is the one boss I actually
had to pull
  his attacks off the Boss FAQ.
  Credit goes to the dude who
  wrote it, because I beat him
  before he used any attacks.
  Copied and pasted from his
  guide, so the format's
  different and more
  descriptive.
- Moon Cutter: After bouncing
  for a while, Moon Destroyer
  will spin across
a row, sending down Moon Cutters
down every column once. They
inflict Panic on you if they
hit. 60/80/100/200/S300

How to Avoid: Dodge or Shield.

- Comet Pitcher: Moon Destroyer
  jumps up and holds up a comet
  in his hand
before pitching it over to where
MegaMan's standing. Deals Break
damage and cracks affected
panel. 70/100/200/250/S300

How to Avoid: Dodge.

- Kick Combo: MegaMan's area
  flashes red, and Moon Disaster
  rushes from
the either row, spinning all the
way to the opposite side while
swinging his leg around. After
that, MegaMan's panel flashes
red, and Moon Destroyer delivers
an Axe Kick that cracks the
affected panel. Axe Kick deals
Break damage. Version 1 does not
Axe Kick. 70/100/150/250/S300

How to Avoid: Shield Spinning
Kick, Dodge Axe Kick.

- Crescent Flurry: Moon
  Destroyer hovers in the middle
  panel and lots of
small crescents start spinning
around him, before one by one,
all eight of these small moons
home towards MegaMan and are
able to deal multi-hit damage.
It seems he only uses this
attack when he's low on health.
-/20/30/40/50

How to Avoid: Dodge (Scarce) or
Shield (Convenient).


Well, now that that's over with,
keep going in that direction.
You don't turn at all, so it's
pretty wasy to get there. When
you get to the pink gate, tap
the Dealer access key thing. The
blue square on the bottom screen
that gets bigger when you're
near the door. Cutscene.
Heartless still has yet to
figure out what's limiting
King's control of Meteor G. Jack
and Jailbait show up. We get a
backstory on these two, and some
stuff happens. King cancels
their Wave Changes and captures
them, laughing the whole time.

Then, the binds dissolve, and
King goes WHAT. Heartless goes
over and tells him that she was
the one who freed them. She lets
out her own evil laugh, and
announces she's been planning to
backstab him all along. Now that
Joker is out of the way, she can
continue with her plan. Looks
like Joker was actually the only
loyal subordinate he had. All
four of his others were
traitorous fiends that turned on
him when they felt it was most
convenient. Heartless opens up a
black hole underneath him and
sucks him into Meteor G. She
even gets out a "You will pay
for your sins!" line. She is
easily the most badass character
in this game. She has more balls
than Geo, Bud, Zack, and Ace
combined.

Oh snap. Jailbait's wish, the
one she's been obsessing over
the entire game, is to crash
Meteor G into the Earth. Is she
nuts? Even after Heartless
reveals that doing so would end
80% of life on Earth, incliding
most humans, they still want to
go through with it. Heartless,
knowing that Megaman is going to
pull a Big Damn Heroes moment
later on, lets them go into the
Meteor COntrol CC to alter its
course and set it to attack
Earth.

Back in control, head into the
warp. You're now at Orbital
base. From here, go down the
ramp and to te right. Step on
the blue wave thing, then the
Wave Station access point.
Cutscene time.

Well hello, sexy, we really need
to stop meeting like this. Wait,
Heartless knows that you're Geo
Stelar? Wow, absolutely everyone
knows, don't they? Anyway, she
introduces herself, Mega points
out she's King's right hand, and
then we find out what the
cutscene revealed a while ago.
She explains all that stuff.
Also, we get a good look at the
Meteor G Control comp. Which,
oddly enough, looks like a
Pokeball. Interesting, neh?

We need to stop the meteor.
Heartless lets us know, FOR
ONCE, we get it straight. No one
tells us it's too dangerous. No
one tells us to let the
authorities handle it. No one
says we're just kids. For once,
we get a person who tells us
that we're Earth's last hope,
that everything is up to us. We
have to stop Jack and Tia now.

Through some unexplained
magic(perhaps Heartless has her
own super stoner hacker moves?),
we end up right at the access
point. Tap it to go in. Go
around until you get to a purple
area with a Noise Hertz. Go up
and left to another purple area.
Follow the yellow path up and
right to a third purple area.
From here go left, then right,
then left again, taking the
upper path each time. Step onto
the big square. You have arrived
at the destination.

You're too late. Meteor G's
course has already been altered
to crash into Earth, and the
controls are locked. Now, it's
time for a generic villain rant
about how his childhood was so
terrible. Oh, woe is me, I used
to be a prince, but then my
daddy got horribly owned by the
economy, and now I'm a sad
little orphan being raised by a
madman! Also, as shown by the
younger sprite, Tia wasn't
always Jailbait. She used to be
a Loli. After a massive amount
of missiles fly around,
exploding haphazardly, and then
out of nowhere it starts raining
or snowing or something.
Seriously, what?

I think their father is related
to Dr. Regal from Battle
Network. Seriously, their plan
is the same as his. Society has
finally crossed the line and
must be eradicated so that a new
society, a perfect society, can
be rebuilt on its ashes. Jack
pulls a Noise Card out and
summons Spade Magnes. Battle
time. This is Spade Magnes V2.

Oh, and one last thing; if you
want to fight Spade Magnes V2 so
you can get the Card, do it now.
Once you fight Spade Magnes V2
here, the game counts him as
being defeated in Echo Ridge.
Refer to the Boss Location
section for more info.

Boss Battle:  Spade Magnes V2
Element:  Elec
Weakness:  Grass
Difficulty:  Easy
Strategy:
Only 800 HP?  Pssh.  Weaksauce.
Attacks:
Same as Spade Magnes.


He explodes in an overly
dramatic fashion. Then it turns
out Jack and Tia actually were
not lying, the controls are
locked. Time to talk to
Heartless. Trans out, pulse out,
then head over to her. Geo and
Omega-Xis, like any rational
being, want to know what the
hell is going on. This is when
Geo's mind nearly explodes.
Turns out that not only is
Kelvin alive, not only is
Heartless an old friend of his,
and not only is he now an EM
being, he is actually inside
Meteor G, fighting it. I wish
you were allowed to type in the
dialogue, because when I met
him, my words would be "You,
sir, are a badass of the fourth
level." Seriously, awesome.

For some reason, probably due to
spriter laziness, Heartless wore
that sexy dress even way back
when. BUM BUM BUM BUUUUUUUUUUM.
Cue the call from Aaron Boreal.
Looks like the Jamming has
cleared up, which is good.
Heartless gives you
KelvinFolder, which is also
nice. Go over to the Wave
Station, pulse in, and head in a
south-easterly direction until
you get to a yelow path that's
twice as wide as the others. At
the end of the double-path,
there's a blue-wave thing. Step
on it and then follow the path
until you get back to the Astro
Wave warp.

From there, go to WAZA. You can
get their via Astro Wave, or you
can go to Alohaha/Echo Ridge and
take the Wave Liner. Either way,
go inside HQ and up to the 57th
floor. Talk to Boreal. We're now
going to be part of Team Star
Force. And then Lee and Woody
come in. We then get a picture
of a massive Wave Station, which
is going to send us into space.
Rather, it will send is into
Woody's rocket, which we'll then
use as a sort of armored tank
that will let us go into Meteor
G. They also want Lee to use his
super stoner hacker moves to
build a Real Wave barrier so
Megaman won't get fried on the
way into space. I don't see why
this is necessary, as Megaman
had no problem going into space
in the first game. And that
time, he was actually going into
deep space, not into a rocket
that's in orbit around Earth.
Quite odd.

Heartless walks in. Turns out
Kelvin is slowing Meteor G, so
we have two days instead of the
twelve hours that WAZA
predicted. Then a Noise Wave
opens and King floats in. Oh
snap, he's not a human anymore.
He's now a Wizard. He charges a
laser, and fires it at Heartless
for betraying him. Before she
gets hit, Megaman pulls another
light-speed movement and blocks
the laser. After he leaves, you
get an e-mail from Luna telling
you to meet everyone on the
roof. God she's bossy.

Once you get control, go to Echo
Ridge. You automatically end up
on the roof, with an absolutely
massive red ball right there in
the sky. Hope joins you after a
bit. Heartless went over to your
house and told your mom
everything. Also, Hope tells you
that Heartless is an old friend.
She's not all that happy that
you never told her yourself, but
then she starts talking about
what a big, strong, handsome man
you are. Uh... No one can love
you like family can, eh?

Anyway, she gives you a
KelvinKey, and then Geo walks
over to the edge. Meteor G
starts pulsing like a dying
heart, and then everything goes
black. You end up in your room,
and you're supposed to go to
WAZA now so you can save the
world. Before you go, however, I
highly recommend you fight and
obtain the V2 card from these V2
bosses: Diamond Ice Club Strong
Jack Corvus Queen Virgo You're
going to be fighting them in the
Meteor Server in a little while,
and once you fight them there,
their V2 locations will forever
disappear in the normal areas.
Refer to the Boss Location
section for details on where to
find them.

Once you're ready to proceed,
take the Wave Liner to WAZA HQ.
Everything is going well, as it
should, except for the fact that
Meteor G is starting to speed
up. Hope tells you that as soon
as you're done saving the world,
she wants you home. You get
encouraging words from everyone.
It's now time to go to Meteor G.
Go up to the giant Wave Station
and press A to go up into space.

Woot, space. Some intense Noise
is happening. Magnes comes in
and boosts the Noise resistance
as he lowers the vibrations.
Turns out this is about as close
to the Meteor as it can get. And
then some viruses appear. Time
for a battle. After you dispose
of the easy viruses, you get
sent to Noise Wave 3. If you
want to go back to Earth, the
Hertz standing here will send
you back. For now, though, go
up, and then follow the path
around in a big loop until you
get to the exit Noise hole. You
should go up until you see a red
Noise Hertz, then right as far
as you can, and down.

As soon as you get there, it
shows you a few locations of
stuff. Interesting places, as
this map is... pretty damn big.
You then see Kelvin, doin
stuff... Anyway, time to get
going. Step forward to start a
cutscene. There's some Crimson
floating there, menacing you.
Mega gives you instructions on
how to deal with it. It's the
same as the Clone Wars. The
Crimson attacks will be repeated
periodically. Follow the red
path all the way to the end,
until you get to the blue path.
Walk up to the red skull tile
and a cutscene will begin.
Kelvin is on the other side. Tap
the Kelvin Key. It'll show you
where all the Memory fragments
are. Once you find all of them,
the door will fall. Luckily for
you, I'm a really nice guy, and
have made maps. http://img253.im
ageshack.us/img253/4504/meteorse
rver1.png

Once you have all the memory
fragments, go back to the red
skull tile. You get to see one
of Kelvin's memories. He's
floating in space, his first
time ever being an EM being. And
for some reason, he's speaking
aloud rather than thinking.
Perhaps EM beings are incapable
of keep their thoughts
unvocalized. He promises he's
going to come home, and then
says Geo is a strong kid. End
cutscene. I advise you save
here, because it's time for a
battle against Diamond Ice V2.

Boss Battle:  Diamond Ice V2
Element:  Aqua
Weakness:  Elec
Difficulty:  Easy
Strategy:
Only 1100 HP?  Pssh.  Weaksauce.
Attacks:
Same as Diamond Ice.


Head into the second area. Got
another map for you. http://img1
87.imageshack.us/img187/5972/met
eorserver2.png

Once you have all the memory
frags, head to the red skull
gate. You'll see Kelvin on his
way out the door for the last
time. And what the hell, Geo had
bright red hair. Kelvin leaves
and so does the door. Get ready
for Club Strong V2.

Boss Battle: Club Strong V2
Element: Grass Weakness: Fire
Difficulty: Moderate Strategy:
He's got 1400 HP. Not bad. Same
as last time, though. Attacks:
Same as Club Strong.


Head into the third area. I have
a map as usual, but this time I
marked a BMW location in yellow.
That BMW contains the Kaiser
Knuckle, the best Mega Weapon
available before you beat the
final boss. http://img33.imagesh
ack.us/img33/5341/meteorserver3.
png

Once you have all the memory
fragments, you get to read it as
Hope and Kelvin name you. Aww,
how sweet. Anyway, follow the
path. I advise saving at the red
skull tile, because it's Jack
Corvus V2 time.

Boss Battle: Jack Corvus V2
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Difficulty: Moderate Strategy:
Uh, he got faster. And gained
four hundred more HP. Dodge the
best you can and counter at
every opportunity. He's a bit
harder than last time. Attacks:
Same as Jack Corvus.

Keep going. There's another boss
waiting, and it's Jailbait Virgo
V2. She's also a bit tougher
than last time. I still advise
saving on the red skull tile.

Boss Battle: Queen Virgo V2
Element: Aqua Weakness: Elec
Difficulty: Easy Strategy: 1600
HP. Still Water. still Jailbait.
Still easy. Attacks: Same as
Queen Virgo.

After you beat her, continue. At
the end of the path, you see the
entrance to the next area. The
next area contains the final
boss, so save beforehand and
make sure you're in tip-top
condition.

Go all the way to the end.
There's a freaking huge ramp,
but once you're all the way up
it, you see Kelvin. He tells you
you've grown, thanks Omega- Xis
for looking after you, and then
seems to remember there's a
giant orb of pulsing doom behind
him. Geo starts pulling the hero
crap, and Kelvin lets him handle
the meteor. King shows up,
chuckles, some ominous music,
raises his arms, does the fusion
dance, and BOOM. There's
suddenly a huge dragon there.
This is Crismon Dragon, and it
is the final boss. It then eats
Kelvin, because Kelvin is so
badass he'll boost Crimson
Dragon's power level to 9000 and
far beyond. Geo's pissed, and
that's never a good thing for
anyone in his way. Time to kick
some dragon ass.

Boss Battle: Crimson Dragon
Element: None Weakness: None
Difficulty: Hard Strategy: This
is Crimson Dragon. He can eat
you. He wil try to eat you.
Memorize his pattern, and dodge
everything you can. At 2500 HP,
he can take more damage than any
previous boss you fought, and
still work fine. He can also
deal out a ton of damage if you
get hit. I managed to Finalize
when he had 1500 HP left, and my
Meteor Server folder just
destoyed him. I won withot
taking damage. The only reason I
put hard as the difficulty is
because he's the final boss, and
they have reputations to uphold.
Once you have his pattern down,
this guy is cake. Attacks: While
he has one head: Dragon Snacks:
He lunges forward and bites,
hard. Team Rockets: Some rockets
randomly generate on the field.
While they're
    still in gray blob form, you
    can destroy them with a
    buster shot. If they fully
    form, the color matches the
    element it will be. Watch
    out for that if you're in an
    elemental Noise.
Great Head: His head will start
shooting at you. Dodge,
mothersucker,
    dodge.
Dragon Claw: Just like the
Pokemon move, he uses his mighty
claws to
    slash at you. I suggest
    dodging, which is easy
    because the panel lights up
    before it gets hit.
While he has two heads: Dragon
Claw: Same as before. Almighty
Vomit: He like, does this thing,
and shoots Noise all over the
    field. Pierces Invis, and
    your shield can only block
    about half.
Team Rockets: Same as before.
Great Head: Same as before.

After that, King is outside it
again. He then... teleports...
or something. Looks like Crimson
Dragon is still going strong
because of Kelvin. He shoots a
bunch of stuff at you outside of
battle, which is just cheating.
These sneaky evil bastard
dragons. Geo faints and Omega-
Xis tries to wake him up. We
then get a generic BN viewing of
all of Geo's friends cheering
him on, somehow giving him
power. In his unconscious mind,
or perhaps in reality, Ace comes
in and encourages you to fight.
He also mentions that he isn't
the kind of guy that goes down
that easily, which is a hint
that he's still alive.

Back in Meteor G, Megaman pulls
a transformation that's similar
to the Beast Out in BN6. You now
have to use the power of the
Black Ace to defeat Crimson
Dragon again. This one, however,
has 8000 HP. Never fear, though,
you do not have to kill it.
You're actually invincible in
this fight. You cannot get
killed. So have fun. The battle
will automatically end as soon
as you use the Black End Galaxy
card, which is a Giga with no
damage value listed. Normally,
it does 500, but for the
purposes of this battle, it does
8000. However, the core must be
exposed as with a regular
attack. Don't forget that. YOu
won't run out of them, though,
so it really doesn't matter. And
I tested it. You actually cannot
win without Black End Galaxy. I
used normal cards to kill him,
but he has some Undershirt that
can only be broken by Black End
Galaxy.

Woot, Kelvin is okay. And then
he disappears. GODDAM WIZARDS.
Geo notices the screen flashing
white and decides to destroy
Meteor G. Meteor G explodes and
the whole world rejoices. And
then we see Geo, floating in a
bubble. Now if only the bubble
were pink and he were in the
fetal position... I suppose we
can't have everything, though.
Geo thinks he's going to die,
all alone in space. Of course,
since he's the main character,
we all know he isn't going to
die. All of his friends start
freaking out, and everyone's
Hunter has received a message.
Every single Hunter in the
world. WHAT?!?! KELVIN HAS SUPER
STONER HACKER MOVES? Goddam, I
knew he was cool. And then he
announces to the world that his
son is Mega Man. What. What's
the point of having a secret
identity if you're literally
going to tell the whole entire
planet? Seriously.

Hope starts sobbing
hysterically. Heartless comforts
her like a good friend does, and
then everyone starts working
around the clock. I honestly do
not know how it is that Geo's
even alive, seeing as you can
only survive in space for about
thirty seconds at most withouta
suit and oxygen. And now it's
time for a generic BN around-
the-world show is support for
the main character! Some little
boy thinks he has a better
telescope than WAZA, which I
think is funny. Jack and Tia go
to Dealer Base to help from
there, and Solo pulls his "Only
I can kill him" thing and goes
along to help. Seriously, he's a
badass. I actually hate to admit
it, but he's even more badass
than Forte was. Laplace cemented
that by looking cooler than
Treble.

Even Strong is getting in on it.
And then the entire world
changes its Purpose to "Get Geo
Back" or some crazy thing like
that. Wow. I almost think they
realize that they're in a game
and that he's the main
character. Kelvin and Omega-Xis
pop up. At least it makes sense
for them to not be breathing,
they're EM beings. They use
their combined super stoner
hacker powers to send Geo back
toward home. This is highly
reminiscent of Star Force One,
when it was Geo's Brother Bands
that guided his broken space
station piece back to Earth. We
get to see the complete third
memory from Kelvin's memory
fragments. Geo flies back to
Earth and all is well.

The credits roll.

Two weeks later, Geo is on top
of the school roof. Again. What
the hell happened to Vista
Point? Anyway, he starts letting
out some pent-up angst.
Suddenly, a blue thing appears
in the sky. CRAP. METEOR G HAD A
BROTHER AND NOW HE'S HERE FOR
REVENGE. TO THE METEOR SHELTERS!

Oh, wait, it's Omega-Xis. It
nearly kills Geo, who is
unsurprsingly out of angst at
the moment. Geo gives him a hug,
happy music plays, and Geo seems
about as happy as a boy who just
found his missing dog. I'm sure
that if lyra was here, she'd
make a comment to that effect.
Another blue meteor thing
appears. CRAP. METEOR G REALLY
DID HAVE A BROTHER. ._.

Oh, damn, it's just Kelvin. Hope
is, as usual, in the kitchen.
Geo walks in, calls her name,
and she tells him to wash his
hands... and then notices the
glowing blue wolf. Omega-Xis
says his line, then Geo steps
out of the way, and Kelvin walks
in. Huzzah, a happy family. We
even get a cute picture of them
together. After your library
data is shown, you get the
option to save. Huzzah. End
chapter.

================================
| Post-Game Walkthrough
[ENRNSE]|
================================

You've finally beaten the game.
Crimson Dragon is dead, Kelvin
is safe, the world isn't
sploded, and you have a sexy
icon on the title screen. What
now? Well, it's quite simple.

Enter the Noise.

After you beat Crimson Dragon
for the first time, and after
the credits roll and you save,
you get the option to Continue.
The only thing special about the
first time is that you get an
email from WAZA. This email
tells you where the secret post-
game Area is. If you leave the
Meteor Server and go back toward
the Wave Liner. Before you get
there, you should see a large
Noise Wave with a purple lining.
It's in the cliff wall next to
the Wave Liner area, to the
right. Pulse in and press A to
enter the Noise.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

This is a pretty cool area. This
is the first of many areas that
all lead up to the secret boss
Sirius. When you first enter, an
Astro Hertz floats his way to
you, and tells you he has a
message for Earth. There's
something destroying his planet,
and he needs help. His planet's
only hope is their Brother on
Earth. Which is, of course, you,
not that you know that yet. I'm
going to give you a little
spoiler: he's from Planet FM.
That's right, the Brother who
needs your help is Cepheus, the
King of Planet FM. This is some
serious(haha Sirius) business.

When he dies and the cutscene
ends, go up. Up and up and up,
sticking to the darker purple-
ish tiles. At the top, you get
to a gate. Crap, they're already
pulling this on us. Let's see
what god-awful and overly
complicated quest we have to do
to get past this one. A Noise
Hertz comes and tells you that
Spade Magnes put the door up.
Sounds simple... what's the
catch? Looks like we just have
to defeat him. Seriously?
That's... so simple. Wow.

Pulse out. Go over to the Wave
Station, pulse in, and head over
toward the Astro Wave. Before
you get there, turn right after
the first ramp. Go right all the
way until you see an access
point leading into a small
antenna. Go into it and walk to
the center. Spade Magnes R is
standing there, looking all
smug. I adivse saving before you
talk to him, because it's time
to battle.

Boss Battle: Spade Magnes R
Element: Elec Weakness: Grass
Strategy: Have fun. He can be
quite difficult, but as with
most bosses, dodging becomes
easy once you have his pattern
memorized. He's got 2000 HP,
which would normally be
problematic, but we're badasses
and laugh at his attempt to
live. Attacks: Same as Spade
Magnes.

After that battle, he explodes
in an overly dramatic fashion
while giving a rant. Holy crap,
this guy is long-winded. HURRY
UP AND DIE. Once he's dead, head
back to Noise Wave 4. Go all the
way back to the gate, which will
now open for you. You'll also
see Spade Magnes R's EM residue,
which means you can now fight
Spade Magnes R whenever you
want. Beating him in under
twelve seconds will max out the
damage that the Spade Magnes GA
will do.

Also of note in Noise Wave 4 is
a Giga card. From the EM
Battery(that floaty red thing
that told you where Spade Magnes
R was), go down until you see a
red path on the right side of
the screen. Follow it until you
see a pink gate. If you've
fought 500 or more battles in-
game, this gate will open and
you'll find a Giga Card behind
it.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

This area is a little...
complex. I'm going to give
directions the best I can. To
begin, stand on the lower first
red panel. From here, go up two,
right three, up two, right
three, and then all the way up.
You can literally hold the up
button and get there. You'll see
the Club Strong R battery.
Examine it to find out where
Club Strong R is. He's in a CC
in Echo Ridge. Pulse out and
take the Wave Liner.

Once in Echo ridge, go to the
Wave Station by Geo's house and
pulse in. Make your way over to
Luna's house and trans in. Go up
the ramp and all the way in that
direction until you see Club
Strong R. Who is, by the way,
still freaking huge. Save
beforehand and talk to him to
battle.

Boss Battle: Club Strong R
Element: Grass Weakness: Fire
Strategy: Holy freaking crap,
3000 HP. That is a lot. Good
news is you can get your Noise
level really high, which is good
because the level 11 Meteor
Server has cool Giga cards like
Atom Blazer. His attacks are
still easy to dodge, except for
his Club Rampage thing.
Finalizing really helps, as long
as you get a good hand. Attacks:
Same as Club Strong

What? No over-the-top explosion?
No "my death is just the
beginning" speech? I like him.
Anyway, trans out, pulse out,
head back to WAZA, and go back
to the R battery in Noise Wave
5. Club Strong R is now
available for a fight whenever
you want. Go right to the pink
gate. It'll now open. The path
from here is pretty
straightforward. Keep going
right until you come to the
Noise Wave entrance to the next
area. You'll need 100 Standard
cards to progress. Check a card
location guide.

Once you have enough, open the
gate and go through the Noise
Wave.

+----------=====================
| Outer Astro Wave 1 [OUTER1]|
+----------=====================

Welcome to the Outer Astro Wave.
You see some big cool towers,
and Omega-Xis tells you that
they are the communication posts
with Planet FM. And then the
three sages of Planet AM show
up. Cepheus is fighting for his
life and desperatelyneeds your
help. There's a barrier around
Planet FM that they can't get
through. It's up to you.

One thing about the Outer Astro
Waves is that the path is
broken, allowing you to walk
around outside of the yellow and
purple areas that you woud be
confined to normally. The R
batteries in this area are also
off the path. I'll do my best to
guide you to them. For the first
one, Diamond Ice R, get off the
path and go over to the three
communication towers. The tower
on the far left is directly in
line with the battery, so with
it above you, just walk down.

For Dark Phantom R, get back on
the path. Starting at the pink
gate, go down. Ignore the first
break on the left and stop at
the second. From the break, go
straight up. Dark Phantom's R
battery is right there. Once you
have examined both, pulse out.
We're going to tackle Diamond
Ice R first. Take the wave Liner
to Alohaha and go to the Beach.

Once you're there, pulse in and
use the Wave Station to get to
the Wave Road. By now, I'm usre
you know where the Dragon Statue
is. Go to it and trans in.
Diamond Ice R is almost all the
way in the back. She tells you
that the R stands for "Rebuilt",
which means the old data left
when the real Diamond Ice was
defeated floated off into space
and was sucked into Sirius'
black hole. She was built from
that data. Time to battle.

Boss Battle: Diamond Ice R
Element: Aqua Weakness: Elec
Strategy: She's the same as the
old Diamond Oce, just a bit
faster and with 2500 HP. Kill
her quickly. Attacks: Same as
Diamond Ice.

After that battle, it's time for
Dark Phantom R. Trans out, pulse
out, and take the Wave Liner to
WBG Studios. Go to the Event
stage and enter the Noise Wave
that leads to Dealer's ground
base. Go to Dealer's ground base
and get onto the Wave Road. Head
up until you get to the Air Duct
CC. In here you'll find Dark
Phantom R. He gets straight to
business.

Boss Battle: Dark Phantom R
Element: None Weakness: None
Strategy: Still simple. Still
easy. Only difference is more
HP. Attacks: Same as Dark
Phantom.

After that lame excuse for a
fight, trans out, pulse out, and
head back to WAZA. While you're
here, though, I advise that you
fight Dread Joker V2 so you
don't have to come back later.
Check the boss location section.

Back in WAZA, head through the
Noise Waves until you get back
to Outer Astro Wave 1. Follow
the path to the end and open the
pink gate. Go into the next
area.

+----------=====================
| Outer Astro Wave 2 [OUTER2]|
+----------=====================

Welcome to Outer Astro Wave 2.
First off, R batteries. One of
them is actually pretty close.
Get off the path, go to the
arrow, and walk down. You should
see it. This is Wolf Woods' R
battery. To get to Cygnus Wing's
R battery, go back to the
entrance. Hold the up arrow on
the D-pad. As you go up, you
should see the R battery on the
right side of the screen. Pulse
out and head to WBG Studios.

Pulse in and use the Wave
Station in the parking lot to go
onto the Wave Road. Go over to
the Real Wave rock and trans in.
Wolf Woods R is in here. I
advise saving before you speak
to him. He loves battle and
wants to kill you. Battle time.

Boss Battle: Wolf Woods R
Element: Grass Weakness: Fire
Strategy: His attacks cover a
wide area and do a good bit of
damage. Your Y Shield is your
second best friend in this
battle, right after Invis.
Attacks: Same as Wolf Woods.

Trans out and pulse out. Head to
Spica Mall via Wave Liner. Pulse
in and use the Wave Station to
get to the Wave Road. Trans into
the Dentist CC. Follow the only
path available until you get to
Cygnus Wing R. It's up and right
until you cant go right anymore.
Then go left. You don't cross
any of those blue wave things on
the way. When you speak to him,
he tells you that the black hole
Sirius controls is actually a
Black Hole Server, much larger
and more powerful than the
Meteor Server.

Boss Battle: Cygnus Wing R
Element: None Weakness: None
Strategy: He's even easier than
last time. Finish him off.
Attacks: Same as Cygnus Wing.

Pulse out and head back to WAZA.
Pulse in, enter the Noise wave,
and go back to Outer Astro Wave
2. Remove the pink gate and
enter the Noise Wave.

+----------=====================
|                               
+----------=====================

Huzzah. Another Noise Wave. Just
walk up until you get to the
double pink gate. To pass
through here, you need 150
different cards. This seems to
confuse people, for some reason.
This means that the total number
of cards in your Library must
equal 150 or more. That means if
you have 120 Standard cards, 29
Mega Cards, and 1 Giga Card, you
can open the doors.

When you have enough, open the
gate. I advise saving before you
get to the end of this short
path, because a boss battle is
coming up.

Boss Battle: Apollo Flame
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Strategy: Uh, dodge. Pack in as
many Invis cards as you can.
This guy has 2500 HP, powerful
attacks, a barrier, and little
fire snake things that want to
eat your soul. Hit him with
powerful cards. If you can
manage to Finalize and get a
DynaWave NFBB, or if you're in
an Aqua Noise and Counter him,
it does a ton of damage.
  If you can beat him with a
  good enough rank, you get his
card.

Attacks: Fire Snake: Some little
fire snake things swarm all over
the field.
    This attack never stops.
Dino Death: Some meteors fly out
of the sky and attempt to
murderlize
    you. YOu can block these
    with your shield.
Spirit Bomb: He raises his arms,
gathers energy, and slams it
down on
    your side of the field,
    laughing maniacally as he
    does so.
Lava Twisters: Exactly what it
says on the tin. Big twisters
made of lava.

Apollo Flame is nothing special.
He laughs a bit, and then
explodes. Now that he's beaten,
there's a shortcut that leads
from Noise Wave 4 to here. It's
the Noise Wave on the left.
Sirius taunts you a bit and then
tells you he's interested in
meeting you. Head into the next
area.

+----------=====================
| Planet FM Astro Wave 1
[FMAST1]|
+----------=====================

This area contains, almost
immediately, one of this game's
scarce references to Protoman.
"Let's rock, Mega!" "Yeah! But
how about a little blues every
once in a while!?"

Cepheus comes and talks to you.
The planet's arsenal is useless
against the black hole. The
troops were completely wiped
out. There's only one day left
before the planet is destroyed,
so we'd better hurry. Geo says
he'll kick Sirius' ass before
that day is up, and save Planet
FM. Cepheus then leaves, and Geo
and Omega-Xis talk a bit. This
chat contains the Protoman
reference. Awesomesauce. Anyway,
as you may have guessed, access
to the next area is blocked by a
couple R bosses. I'll do my best
to guide you to the Batteries.

First, get off the path. Go to
the arrow that leads into the
next area, and walk up along the
underside until you can see the
lower tip of the pink gate at
the very top of your screen.
Walk straight down. You should
see the R battery for Taurus
Fire R. From that Battery, walk
straight left. After a while,
you'll come upon the R Battery
for Moon Destroyer R.

Let's go get Moon Destroyer
first. Pulse out and go to Echo
Ridge. Go into the school and
head up to the roof. Pulse in
and get onto the Wave Road.
Follow the road until you get to
the Tree CC and trans into it.
Head up and to the right until
you get to a ramp. Go up the
ramp and then left. Moon
Destroyer R is there and god,
he's still pathetic.

Boss Battle: Moon Destroyer R
Element: None Weakness: Anything
that does damage. Strategy: Ugh,
this one says YO! too. Good news
is that he's still slow, still
pathetic, and still an easy win.
Have fun destroying him.
Attacks: Same as Moon Destroyer.

After that pitiful excuse for a
battle, we need to take care of
Taurus Fire. Crap, he's back at
Dealer Base. Go to WBG Studios,
enter the Noise Wave, and go
there. Go inside and pulse in,
using the Wave Station to get
onto the Wave Road. Follow he
path as if you were going to the
big room that you fought Joker
in. Instead of following the
path all the way, stop and trans
into the Analysis Unit CC.
Taurus Fire R is in here. When
you talk to him, he tries to
pretend he's the real Taurus
Fire. And then he slips up and
says Luna told him. Silly nub,
Bud always calls that thing
"Prez". Time to kill him.

Boss Battle: Taurus Fire R
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Strategy: Same old Taurus. Blast
him with anything that does
damage and he'll fall pretty
quickly. Attacks: Same as Taurus
Fire.

After yet another simple battle,
trans out, pulse out, and make
your way back to Planet FM Astro
Wave 1. Follow the path to
Planet FM Astro Wave 2, removing
the pink gate when you get to
it.

+----------=====================
| Planet FM Astro Wave 2
[FMAST2]|
+----------=====================

Follow the nice, curvy path. The
blue wave thingies shorten the
distance you walk but don't do
much else, so I suggest you use
them. Eventually, you will get
to a pink gate. Looks like you
need to beat Queen Virgo R.
First we're going ohave to
activate the R Battery, which
you cna getto by going up and
then left from the Astro Hertz.
Looks like she's in a CC in the
Mall Event Area. Pulse out and
go to Spica Mall. Pulse in and
use the Wave Station to get up
to the Wave Roads. Go into the
Mall Event area. Trans into the
Spimo the Cat statue. Jailbait
Virgo R is in here and just
itchin to fight.

Boss Battle: Queen Virgo R
Element: Aqua Weakness: Elec
Strategy: Same old, same old.
Kill her. R bosses are so
repetitive. Attacks: Same as
Queen Virgo.

Trans out, pulse out, go back to
Planet FM Astro Wave 2. Remove
the pink gate and keep going.
Eventually, you'll get to an R
Battery, this one for Jack
Corvus R. Pulse out and go into
WAZA. Take the elevator up to
the 57th floor, and use the Wave
Station to get on the Wave Road.
Go all the way to the back and
into the Main Computer CC. Jack
Corvus R is on the way to the
back, where you fought Acid Ace
V1 and Dark Phantom. He teases
Mega for a bit, then starts the
battle.

Boss Battle: Jack Corvus R
Element: Fire Weakness: Aqua
Strategy: He's a bit tougher.
Still the same old Jack, though,
so no sweat. Just dodge his
easily predictable attacks and
hit him with our best stuff.
Attacks: Same as Jack Corvus.

After that lovely battle, head
back to FM Astro Wave 2. Unlock
the pink Corvus gate and head
through. You're almost there.
Step through into the next area.

+----------=====================
| Planet FM Astro Wave 3
[FMAST3]|
+----------=====================

This is a simple area. See the
three blue wave things in front
of you? You can get to the Black
Hole Server by stepping on the
middle one. As soon as you walk
forward from the end of that
one, battle against RogueZ.

Looks like Burai is here. And
then Laplace shows up to
surround you. Solo is here to
kill Sirius, just like you, but
unlike you, he wants to wait two
days before he does it. Sirius
took some Mu Metal from Mu, and
Burai is pissed. However, it can
only be taken back after a
certain amount of time... Two
days from now. If Sirius is
defeated any earlier, the Mu
Metal will be lost. Burai wants
it badly because it will allow
Laplace to gain a few levels in
badass. He asks if you would
like to fight him, and when you
say yes, he tells you you're
finally thinking like a man.
Some more chat, Burai says this
fight is for honor, and then
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!

Boss Battle: Rogue Z Element:
None Weakness: None Strategy:
Whoo, his barrier is a lot
better than last time. It
regenerates every time he moves,
and he moves fast. At 2500 HP,
he's pretty hard. Attacks: Same
as Rogue.

After that fight, which was
awesome, he admits you are
better than he is. Then he
leaves. It's now time to save
Planet FM from the Black Hole.

Interestingly, there's a gate in
this area that's on the right
side. It opens once you beat
Rogue Z, so if you want to go
open it, there's a BMW behind it
that contains an Ability Wave
that makes your buster sound
like a cat.

+----------=====================
| Black Hole Server 1 [VACUUM]|
+----------=====================

I find it weird that this is a
CC. It's also dark in here. Time
to wander around. I'm just going
to tell you how to get through
this area. If you want to know
what is where and how to get it,
wander around on your own.

To continue, just go along the
only path. When it branches out
into two directions, pick one.
They both lead to the same
place. Once you've picked, keep
going until you get a chance to
turn. Turn, then go into the
warp. From here, keep going in
the direction you were facing
when you left the warp. Step on
the second. Again, keep going in
that direction. Step on the
third warp. I advise that you
save before continuing, because
it's time for a double fight.
When you're ready, step forward.

Oh look, Acid Ace R. He tells
you how powerful he is, mentions
that you yourself must be
powerful, and then says "us".
Who is this "us" he refers to?
Why, himself and Dread Joker R
of course. Joker appears and now
it's time to fight.

Boss Battle: Dread Joker R
Element: None Weakness: None
Strategy: Same as usual. High
powered cards, plenty of
counters, the works. Attacks:
Same as Dread Joker.

Boss Battle: Acid Ace R Element:
None Weakness: None Strategy:
Same as usual. He still spams
elements like nobody's business,
but is still easy to dodge.
Attacks: Same as Acid Ace

After you kill them, Sirius
starts laughing. Looks like he's
up next. As it's time to go,
step on the warp Acid Ace R was
guarding. This will take you to
the platform that contains the
entrance to the next area.

+----------=====================
| Black Hole Server 2 [YSOSRS]|
+----------=====================

Still dark. Still creepy. Still
a rather simple area. You can't
actually progress until you have
every Standard Card, so I advise
doing that. The Card Location
FAQ will tell you where to find
any that you're missing, so I
suggest using it.

Anywya, follow the path. In the
beginning, it branches off
often, with gates that lead to
warps that lead to goodies.
These gates have requirements
like "Collect all Mega Cards"
and "Collect all Battle Cards".
If, like me, you went Illegal
Data grinding and actually have
every Mega card, you can open
the door to find a MegaClass+1
behind it. Not very useful, but
nice to have.

Keep goin, keep goin. You'll
eventually get to a gate that
says access is restricted by
XXXXXs. What a weird name. It's
actually Sirius, but they felt
they need to put spoiler tags
over most of the name. I don't
get it. From there, just keep
going. You'll get to some ramps
after a while, with a pink gate.
If you have all the Standard
Cards, unlock the gate and head
through. From here, you see two
ramps. One going to the right,
one going to the left. Take the
left one, because the right one
doesn't have anything of
interest yet. Once you beat
Sirius, his V2 will appear over
there.

At the bottom of the left ramp,
you get another path split. One
going down, one going up. Take
the one going down. This path is
simple and doesn't curve, so
yay. I suggest that you save
before you step onto the big
dark blue square, because Sirius
is there and he wants to add you
to his special collection.

What the hell. He has this
creepy smile and like, anime
eyes that never open. And he's
blue. What the hell. It's been
about a hundred years since he
last had a guest, so he's
reasonably excited. He wants to
suck out your soul, but we can't
have that, now can we? Mega
calls him insane and Geo talks
about how he wants to kick
Sirius' ass, but Sirius just
ignores him and starts talking
about all the battles he'll
stage. Sirius is actually not at
all serious, and sees planets
and people as toys for him to
play with. This dude is going
down.

Boss Battle: Sirius Element:
None Weakness: None Strategy:
HAH. AN ACTUAL STRATEGY THIS
TIME. Pack your folder with
DoubleGrabs or AreaGrabs and
non-elemental Standard cards
such a swords so you can build
up Noise. First, use a
DoubleGrab and an AreaGrab, or
three AreaGrabs, or two
DoubleGrabs, and confine him to
one row. This makes him
deliciously easy. Then, spam
your non-elemental cards to
build up Noise and Finalize.
Wait until he's down to 1200 or
so HP to actually Finalize,
though, because the Meteor
Server is not powerful enough to
deal 2600 damage in three turns
unless you get lucky. This guy
has 3000 HP, Status Guard,
Omnishoes, and lasers. Lots of
lasers. Attacks: Generic Laser
Beam!: He stops and shoots a
generic laser beam down one row.
     From what I've seen, I
     think he only uses this
     attack
 when he's trapped to one row.
Frickin Laser Beams: His yellow
things detach and go along the
rows in front
     of him. They deal elemental
     damage, with the color of
     the laser matching the
     element it deals. This is
     hard to dodge, can't be
     shielded, and I think it
     pierces Invis.
Little Yellow Things: His big
wing things detach and start
flying at you.
     These little bastards deal
     both Sword and Breaking
     damage, so all you Cygnus
     and Libra users better
           watch out.
SIRIUS. BUSINESS.: His ginormous
yellow things on his back detach
and

     attach themselves to his
     arms. He floats up and just
     unleashes hell. He fires a
     freaking MASSIVE laser of
     many colors. It hits the
     center row twice and breaks
     any Normal panel it hits.
     It pierces your Shield and
     pierces Invis. This attack
     is trouble in all caps.

After that interesting battle,
he tells you there are many ways
to go and that you're only an
inch from deletion yourself.
He's sending all of his powers
to another server, and then
gives you a cryptic message
about the five gold title icons.
He gives you the Mu Metal,
though this isn't brought up
until a minute later. He
explodes in an overly dramatic
fashion, and you are done here.
Now that Sirius is gone, Burai
transes in and tells you that
you have his Mu Metal. He wants
to kill you, but he'll wait a
few days to do it...

Then Cepheus transes in. How the
hell are all these people
getting in here? Why didn't
Cepheus just bust out
AndromedaInfinity and whoop
Sirius' ass himself? This is
never explained. Now that Planet
FM is saved, Cepheus has to
actually be a king again. Oh
well. We get to read a speech
about the power of friendship or
some crap like that, and then
Cepheus leaves. Bonus Chapter,
end.

| Brother Band Help Quests
[BROBND]|
================================

--------------------------------
|                               
--------------------------------

Jax is the guy standing near the
river. He's a man sprite wearing
a grey suit and he needs help
finding his brother. Turns out
that every time he tries to type
in the apartment number, he gets
an error. When you agree to help
him, he'll give you the note. Go
over to Luna's apartment
building but don't go in. Stand
just in front of the door and
type in a three digit number,
then hit OK. Omega-Xis mentions
that the note is upside down, so
type in 196 and the man's
brother will talk to you. Go
back to Jax and he'll ask you to
form a Brother Band with him. Do
so and you'll get an extra 40
LinkPower.

--------------------------------
|                               
--------------------------------

On the 2F hallway of the school,
there's a girl sprite outside
the classroom. She's the Quiz
Girl in this game. Accept her
request and the quiz will begin.

Question #1 Gearoid ran the 400
meter relay for his track team.
He ran his hardest, and was able
to squeeze past the person in
second place. What place did
Gearoid finish in? Answer #1
Type in the number 2 and hit OK.

Question #2 A hot dog eating
contest wsa held with ten
people. Ben finished 6th from
the bottom. What place did Ben
finish in? Answer #2 Type in the
number 5 and hit OK.

Question #3 A marathon with ten
people was held on a track
around a playing field. Greg
just managed to pass the person
in last place right before the
finish line. Greg was the only
person to pass the runner in
last place. What place did Greg
finish in? Answer #3 Type in the
number 1 and hit OK.

When you're done with her quiz,
the two of you form a Brother
Band. That's 40 more LinkPower
for you.

--------------------------------
|                               
--------------------------------

Also on the 2F hallway of the
school building, this girl is
near the back entrance to class
5-B. She's a big fan of Belle
and wants an autograph. Since
you're such a nice guy, and are
friends with Belle, agree to get
it for her. Go to WBG Studios.
Go into the room across from the
editing room and talk to Belle.
You ask for her autograph and
she says sure, you can have it.
But only if you get an autograph
from Megaman. Pulse in and a
drawing area will appear on the
bottom screen. Just doodle
whatever. When you're done, you
get MM's Sig. Pulse out and talk
to Belle to trade it for Belle's
Sig. Go back to Fany and give
her the autograph. She'll form a
Brother Band with you. You get
40 more LinkPower.

He's the brown-shirted boy
sprite in the classroom. He
wants to trade Sonia Cards with
people so he can get a certain
card. He'll give you the
SoniaWink Card. You're supposed
to be going out and getting a
Little Devil Sonia Card. This is
actually a sequence of trades,
so it may take a few minutes. Go
down to the first floor and go
all the way to the end, past the
snack shop. You'll see a boy
standing there. Trade your
SoniaWink for his Tennis Outfit
Sonia. Now go to Echo Ridge Park
and trade with the little girl
who's standing all by herself.
She'll trade your Tennis Outfit
Sonia for her Sonia the Acrobat.
Go to Spica Mall and look for
the big red-shirted man sprite
right near the Wave Liner. He
has the Little Devil Sonia Card
and wants a Sonia the Acrobat.
Since that's the one you have
and he has the one you want,
trade. Go back to Don McCard to
get your new Brother and 40 more
LP.

Hamer is that senile old dude
who's to the left of the school
gate. Talk to him to find out
he's guilty that he vandalized a
bunch of stuff, starting with
the school. He's too old to
clean it up, so it's up to you.
He gives you the CleaningSet
when you accept his Help
request. Go up to the school
roof and go a little to the
right and then up. Face the
unseen right wall of the
elevator and examine it to find
the graffiti. You then get a
phone call telling you to go
clean the graffiti in Spica
Mall. Go there and get to the
Wave Station.

From the Wave Station, go to the
left. Examine the unseen wall of
the candy shop. You then get
another call telling you to go
to Alohaha castle. Holy crap, is
this guy 500 years old?!? He was
there when the castle was built?
How is he not in a museum?
Anyway, go to Alohaha. Go up the
stairs in front of the castle,
but don't go in. Go to the left,
and then up. There's an unseen
passage here that goes up to the
second floor. Examine the blank
wall to find out that it says
"Repairs complete!" Oh, sneaky.
Go back to Echo Ridge and talk
to Hamer Nayl. He gives you an
HPMem20 and asks to become your
Brother. w00t 40 more LP.

Go to WBG Studios. Near the Real
Wave rock, you'll see a generic
woman sprite in need of help.
She wants pictures of beautiful
places to be in a new show. She
gives you a camera once you
accept her request. From here,
take the Wave Liner to Alohaha.
Go ot the big blue square in the
center of the area and talk to
the generic Old Man sprite. He
tells you what a great view of
the castle you get from there.
Face the general direction of
the castle and press A when Mega
tells you. From here, go to the
beach and swim out to the place
with the ramp. Talk to the
woman. then walk out to the end
of the little island and press
A. Time to go back to Onda. When
she gets the photos you took,
she forms a Brother Band and

This is the generic boy sprite
on the far right of the mall
event area. He has a green
shirt, blue pants/shorts, and a
yellow hat. his Hunter VG is
broken and you need someone to
fix it. He gives it to you, and
now it's time to find someone
who can actually repair the
thing. Go to National WAZA HQ
and talk to Aaron Boreal. He
fixes it in five seconds, so
time to go back to Gian. 40 more
LP for you when he gets it back
and forms a Band with you.

You can increase the amount of
LP she gives you. This one is
simple. Talk to her, read her
Help request, and then talk to
her again. She wants a Black
Hole 1 Card. When you get one,
give it to her. You can get them
from the Black Hole viruses in
the Meteor Server. 40 more LP
for you!

Another LP-boosting mission.
Offer to help find out who keeps
stealing his ginger beef. He
gives you a microwaveable Ginger
Beef meal. He tells you to set
it as bait, so let's do that.
First things first, go to Echo
Ridge via Wave Liner. Go into
Bud's house and set the ginger
beef down on the floor. Leave,
then come back in. Why, it's
gone! Now, go up to the fridge
in the top corner of the room
and examine it to get the ginger
beef spices. Now, lay the trap
again, but this time, pile on
the spice. Then leave again and
you hear someone yelling. Go
back inside, put on yout
Visualizer, and talk to Taurus.
Take the Wave Liner back to WAZA
and talk to Bud. Whoo, yet
another 40 LP.
