========
Intro
========

Start up the game, and select a
file to save your data to. Watch
the opening video, and you'll
meet Captain Travers who will
ask for your name. Input
whatever you want to be called
(yes, even pumpkin like your
mommy calls you). Travers will
ask you a series of questions
about what kind of dinosaur you
like best, so choose whatever
floats your boat.

You'll arrive at VIVOSAUR
ISLAND!!! WOOO!!! We're here!!!
Anyways, you'll meet Beth and
Sue, who will in turn introduce
you to Dr. Diggins. You will end
up in the Fossil Center. Then,
you are told to check into the
hotel, so go do so.

After you check in, head back to
the Fossil Center and talk to
Wendy. Then, head into the back
room and talk to Diggins. He
will have you clean your very
first fossil. You will get your
first Vivosaur, so now you can
take your Fighter's License
exam. Head to the building to
the left of the Fossil Center
and talk to Tiffany to begin
your exam. They consist of two
parts: First, you must clean a
fossil above a specified level.
Next, you have to win a battle
against an opponent.

For your first exam, after you
clean the fossil, Tipper will
teach you how to battle. Then,
head to your first real battle.
You'll face Travers, but he is
extremely easy. Beat him, and
get your Fighter's License.
Travers will give you a fossil
for the vivosaur you specified
when you first met him. However,
since it isn't a head piece, you
cannot revive it at this time.

========
Day # 1
========

The next day, Diggins will tell
you about the Trial dig site.
Exit your room and take a right
into the next screen. Head to
Bea Ginner (heh, get it?) and
get ready to dig up your first
fossils!

Follow her instructions, then
head back to the Fossil Center
once you are done digging.
Diggins will introduce you to
KL-33N, who is a fossil cleaning
robot. Yes, it is funny, but he
does his job, so make sure you
train him well. Clean your
fossil rocks and you should get
a new Vivosaur to add to your
arsenal.

Head back to Bea Ginner and back
to the Trial dig site. You'll
meet and fight Holt, a fellow
Fossil Fighter. After you beat
him, Diggins will tell you about
Greenhorn Plains, a new fossil
site. Head to the dock to get
there.

Dig up some rocks, then head up
to talk to the Fossil Center
employee at the top of the
screen. He'll ask you to hand
over your medals, so do so. Once
in the area, head straight up
and talk to the girl in pink.
Dig up a couple rocks and you
will find that you've been duped
(or smeckledorfed). Go to leave,
and you will find your medals,
however the girl's medals are
not there. You need to head to
the police station to get this
sorted out. Talk to Captain
Bullwort, and Rosie will
introduce herself. After
talking, make sure you have
three Vivosaurs in your team,
then head to the stadium and
talk to Tiffany.

Once you beat P.B. Jay, head to
the Fossil Guild. The man there
will tell you Medal Dealer Joe
is in Greenhorn plains, so head
over there. Head straight to
where you first saw him and talk
to him to fight him. After you
fight him, you will be able to
get your next Fighter's License.
Head to the stadium once you're
ready, and get your next
license. Once you get through
that, you'll be a level 2
fighter.

========
Day # 2
========

You'll be able to access
Knotwood Forest, a new dig site,
now. Head over there, and you'll
meet up with Holt again. He'll
tell you that you can now buy
upgrades for your sonar and such
at the shop inside the Fossil
Guild. They come in handy, but
seeing as you don't have enough
money yet, don't bother going
back now. There are many new
fossil rocks here for you to dig
up, so keep digging and reviving
Vivosaurs until your heart's
content.

Rosie will also be at Knotwood
Forest, and she is arguing with
a real Fossil Center employee
this time. She wants permission
to head deeper into the forest,
but she isn't allowed. Rosie
will drag you to her
grandfather, Mr. Richmond. Mr.
Richmond tells you to find
Diggins, but he is always busy.
You will need to bribe the
weirdo with some Dino Cakes that
are in the Fossil Guild. Head
into Diggins' office in the
Fossil Center, and he will
eventually grant you access to
the area.

Once back in Knotwood Forest,
you will have to fight the
Fossil Center employee in order
to proceed. There are even more
new fossil rocks here, but
continue along the path until
you reach a row of stumps.
Remember how Holt explained how
lighter colored rocks, stumps,
etc. were breakable? Break the
light stumps to proceed. Head up
once you reach the VMM and you
will meet the Chieftan. He will
give a mission to head into the
Digadigamid, and once you
accept, he will do a funny dance
for ya. Rosie will get zapped by
lightning (yea I don't get it
either) and she will end up
speaking like the Digadigs do.
Head into the pyramid, and you
will have to beat a baddie to
continue.

There are new fossil rocks here
for you to discover, so it's up
to you if you want to dig them
up later, or to head back to
town and revive them. Either
way, you will have to fight a
dog. Now this is no reason to
call animal control because he
is a certified Fossil Fighter.
And yes, this game will get
weirder. Muuuccch weirder.

To proceed through the next
floor, you have to break the
lighter colored bones. At the
end of this tunnel is a long-
nosed man. Once you beat this
schnoz, he will open a trap door
because he is a sore loser.
Remember kids, there is no need
to be a sore loser and cause
others physical pain. You will
meet Nevada Montecarlo once you
wake up. She is the fossil
fighter that Diggins sent. To
proceed, use your sonar to find
a Keymonite fossil that is
buried underground. Once you
clean the fossil, Nevada will
use it to unlock a door, and a
ladder comes on down. Head to
the end of the tunnel you end up
in, and in the next room, you
come across the dog, the long
nosed man, and a woman named
Vivian.

Being the cowards they are, they
trap you yet again, and you have
to find the way out. After all,
Nevada isn't very good at
deciphering secret messages. If
you cannot figure out the
message, it says: A secret
tunnel hides between the two
unbreakable bones! Dig. So,
listen to the strange message
and you will uncover another
secret tunnel. Hop on down, and
you will end up back at the
entrance. It may be a good idea
to save your game because you
will be facing Vivian now.

After she is defeated, bring the
treasure she dropped to the
Chieftain. He will end up giving
it to you. And yes, Rosie will
still talk like a Digadig.

The next morning, you will have
the chance to become a Level 3
Fighter. Revive any Vivosaurs
you have yet to revive, then
head to the Stadium to go get
your license. Don't worry, I'll
wait for you.

...done yet? No?!?! Jeez, hurry
up!

...Now? Alright good. Now that
you're a Level 3 Fighter, get
ready for the next day's events.
Night night.

========
Day # 3
========

Rivet Ravine will now be
available to you, so head on
down there. Beth will tell you
about McJunker, whom you will
meet a little later. Once in
Rivet Ravine, a man named Sam
Inaro will tell you to bring
back 8 fossil rocks. They have
to be "New" fossil rocks that
you have yet to revive.

Once you're done with that, Sam
will do a dance, and lightning
(again?) will strike you. You
are now able to determine what
element the fossil rocks are
before you revive them. Not too
useful I suppose, but whatever.

Head upwards and cross the
bridges until you reach the top
of the map. Inside you will meet
the famed (well, kinda)
McJunker. He'll ask to borrow
your sonar so he can upgrade it
to find buried tools.

In the left tunnel, head to the
room with the VMM use your sonar
to find the tools, and a battle,
waiting for you. Once you've
beaten him, head back to the
room with McJunker.

In the right tunnel, go straight
past the VMM and follow that
tunnel to a dead end. The other
tool will be there, and yet
another fight. Head back to
McJunker.

Once you give McJunker the
tools, he will ask you to clean
them. Once you do that, he will
tell you that he needs some
Electrominite, which his
assistant at his shop, the Junk
Depot, has. However, you will
need a V-Raptor in your current
team to prove that McJunker sent
you. If you do not have a
V-Raptor yet, they are in
Greenhorn Plains.

McJunker's assistant is none
other than Holt. Save before you
battle him, as he is fairly
tough. Give the Electrominite to
McJunker, and he will let you
use the mine cars. Take the mine
car on the right, and head into
the chamber. The BB Bandits are
here, and get ready to fight Rex
and Snivels right after each
other.

They will run away and leave
another idol behind. Dig it up,
and McJunker will come see you.
He tells you that the Level Up
Battles are going to begin, so
head to the Stadium once you are
ready.

You'll meet up with Rosie after
you get your Level Four License.
Save your game and get ready for
the next day.

========
Day # 4
========

You will unlock Bottomsup Bay,
so go to the dock to head over
there. Beth will give you a
Diver's Mask so you can breathe
underwater.

Once you've arrived, you'll
notice that Rosie is surrounded
by denture sharks (see, it gets
even weirder. But just wait...).
You will have to go rescue her,
however, the denture sharks
aren't too happy to see you. If
they see you, they will chase
after you and sent you back to
the entrance.

Walk slowly towards Rosie and
avoid the denture sharks as best
you can. If you are spotted, try
to run and hide from them. If
you get hit, you'll be sent back
to start.

Once you rescue lil' miss Rosie,
she'll join. Once you get past
the denture sharks, they will
stop chasing you so you don't
have to keep an eye out for them
any longer.

Break the coral near the left of
the area to find a secret
passage that will advance you to
your goal, a sunken ship.
However, there are two more
secret passages to find which
have new fossils in them. Break
the coral in the center and the
top right of the map to find
both of them. Head into the
sunken ship passage to continue.

In the ship, you will no longer
need your mask because the ship
has air in it (? how?). Anyways,
there are quite a few treasure
chests within the ship that are
yours for the taking. Take a
left and enter the first room on
the top of the screen. Inside is
a chest. Take the stairs that
are to the left of the room and
you'll reach floor 2.

Immediately to your left is a
room with another chest in it.
Grab the treasure and take the
staircase up to floor number 3.

In the room to the right, you
will find the Golden Mask in the
chest. Take the stairs near the
crack in the floor and head back
down to floor 2.

Head allll the way to the right
of the ship, passing by the
staircase to floor
3. Inside the chest in the room
   is a book that will enable
   you to use "Team
Skills", which are more powerful
moves that your Vivosaurs can
use. Then, head up to floor 3 by
using the staircase immediately
to the left of that room.

Head to the right and enter
Captain Woolbeard's room. He
will tell you to rescue his
favorite beard accessory, his
beard ribbon (-_-). However, the
dastardly Snivels and Rex will
lock you in the room. But, a
mysterious woman explodes the
door open again, inspects
Woolbeard's desk, and then goes
ahead and leaves. Weirdo.

Rosie suggests asking her
grandfather as to where to find
the ribbon, so go head off
there.

Richmond tells you that he gave
it to his friend (ugghh) Nick
Nack. Nick Nack is also staying
at the Relic Hotel, so head on
over. Take the elevator on the
left and his room is the first
one. Nick Nack is willing to
hand over the ribbon as long as
you can get him three things.
The first is a molted bug shell,
which you can find in Digadig
Village.

Head on over to Knotwood Forest,
and enter Digadig Village. But,
lucky for us, our ole pal Rex is
dying to fight us again. Beat
the pup and go talk to the
Chieftain. The Chieftain will
teach you a special dance to get
the fossil bugs to come out.
Press "A" to dance (Finally!
Dancing!) and a fossil bug will
molt its shell for you. How
nice. Bring it to Nick Nack.

Now he wants a Sandal Fossil, so
go to Greenhorn Plains. There,
you will find Mr. Big Nose, the
one and only Snivels. Kick his
sorry behind to the curb, and go
to the area where all the junk
is. The mysterious girl will
show up again and she will give
you the Sandal Fossil. Go on and
give it to Mr. Nack.

His final request is a pair of
dentures from a denture shark.
Rosie will refuse to go with
you. As you head to Bottomsup
Bay, Holt will tell you that a
new pay-to-dig site is open at
Greenhorn Plains. If you would
like some more powerful
Vivosaurs, go ahead and grab
some. If not, continue to the
Bay.

Run past the denture sharks into
the second area where they will
stop chasing you. In the center
of that area is a hole which you
must enter. Head to the right of
the den and nab the shark's
dentures. Clean the dirty
dentures and give 'em to Nick
Nack.

As you go to enter the elevator,
Vivian will fight you. Dispose
of her, and give Nick his
dentures. He will then give you
the famed BEARD RIBBON! Head
back to Woolbeard's room in
Bottomsup Bay inside the sunken
ship.

There, you will find that the BB
Bandits gave Woolbeard a fake
ribbon. He gets extremely
ruffled, so you have to beat him
to the ground to get him back to
normal. Once you do, he gives
you yet another idol. You will
now be able to get your Level 5
license, so go on and do so.

========
Day # 5
========

Mt. Lavaflow is now unlocked as
a dig site. The hotel manager
also informs you of another
seminar in Rivet Ravine.
However, once you exit the
hotel, a police officer will
escort you to Captain Bullwort.
Rosie has been kidnapped by the
BB Bandits, and its up to you to
rescue your gal pal.

But Rosie can wait for now. Head
to the seminar in Rivet Ravine,
and Sam will ask you to find 16
"New" fossil rocks that you have
yet to discover. Keep in mind
that you will need to upgrade
your fossil case to hold 16
fossil rocks. You can buy the
upgrade at the shop for a fee.
Once you do that, you will be
able to dig up rarer dark fossil
rocks. These rocks are
completely black and contain
either jewels or rare red
fossils. Red fossils will
automatically give you another
25 points for your Vivosaur.

After the seminar, grab the
idols from your hotel room and
head to the dock in the Park
Area. Fight the BB Bandit here,
and take the ship to a new dig
site, the BB Base. There are new
fossils here as well as fossil
battles. I recommend fighting
the BB Bandits because they will
give your Vivosaurs more
experience, however you can run
past them if you choose.
Whatever you choose, Rex will be
waiting for you at the end of
the third floor. As expected,
Snivels is waiting for you at
the next floor. Vivian awaits
you at the next floor also.

The next area has you meeting up
with Captain Bullwort. But
wait!?!?! The little deviant is
actually a baddie! He has Rosie
captured, so you must beat
Bartholomew Bullwort to rescue
her. Rosie wants to talk with
her grandfather, so go do so.

Aaaand after that, you will be
able to get your Level 6
fighter's license. Go do that,
and after Rosie will ask you to
meet her at the park later that
night. (;P). Save and get a
little rest before your meeting
with her.

========
Day # 6
========

You'll find Rosie near the water
in the Park Area where she'll
give you a kiss. You sly dog!

Next morning, you'll find a
really annoying father and son
who insist that the legendary
Saurhead is better than you.
Pssshhh, he's all talk.

Head to Mt. Lavaflow, and along
the way Diggins will upgrade
your sonar so that you can find
the final idol.

As you continue along Mt.
Lavaflow, you will reach an
unbreakable rock in your path.
Luckily Ms. Duna shows up and
blows it up with her ray gun
(right). Further along, Duna
will blow up another rock for
you so that you can find the
final idol. Once you do, she
will try and take it from you!
She ends up transforming into a
dinosaur herself (see! I told
you it gets reaaally weird. And
this isn't even the end!).

Once you beat her, she will get
crushed by a large boulder. Be a
gentleman (or lady) and rescue
her by breaking the rock. She
leaves confused because you
saved her, and Rosie enters the
picture. She suggests taking the
idol back to Richmond, so go on.

However, the BB Bandits have
taken over the town. There is a
BB blocking your way to the
Guild Area. Once he is beaten,
you'll have access to the Guild
Area again. Here, your objective
is to get to Richmond's room.
Along the way are BB Bandits
that will chase you. You can
either avoid or fight them.

Once you're in Richmond's room,
you will face off with Bullwort
again. This time he has a
MASSIVE Vivosaur, Frigi. You are
unable to beat him no matter
what, so don't feel bad if you
lose. Bullwort will toss you in
jail.

After you try to escape and
check every corner, talk to
Rosie. Rex will eventually come
and chew you a way out. Rex will
help you get to the Fossil
Center where Richmond, Diggins,
Snivels, and Vivian are waiting
for you. Your next task is to go
speak with the Digadig
Chieftain, so head over there.

Once you've arrived, talk to the
Chieftain. He is afraid of even
hearing Frigi's name, so you'll
have to keep talking to him. He
will inform you that a Vivosaur
named Ignosaurus is able to beat
Frigisaurus, and Igno is located
within Mt. Lavaflow. Head back
to the Fossil Center and inform
the others of what you've just
learned. Rex tells you that
there are lava drain valves so
that you can drain all the lava
from Mt. Lavaflow. Diggins will
hand you a Doglish translator
(oh jeez) so that you can
understand Rex. As it turns out,
Rex is an extremely well versed
scholar who will help you find
the valves.

At Mt. Lavaflow, head up to the
rightmost tunnel. There, you
will have to clean off keys to
get past the doors. In the next
tunnel, your goal is to break
open a rock to find a valve.
Break open the rocks until you
find it, then drain the lava.

Back to where you entered the
tunnel, you'll need to head over
to the far left tunnel. Once
there, search for the Igno
fossil. It will flash red on
your sonar. Unfortunately,
Bullwort comes up and makes it
impervious to cleaning by
zapping it. Head back to Diggins
and to show him the fossil.

Once there, head out to Mt.
Lavaflow to dig up some new
fossils for your team, then head
back to Diggins. He will have
you try to break open the rock,
but to no effect. Duna will show
up and zap it with her ray gun
so that you may clean it. Clean
the fossil, and add the Igno to
your team. Then, go back to
Bullwort and fight the traitor.

When Bullwort is out of the
picture, level up battles can
start. Go get your Master
Fighter's License, and when
you've done that, you will get a
letter from Duna asking you to
meet her in the Park Area at
night.

She will tell you she is
Dinaurian, a race of Dino-
people. She will also give you a
smooch.

========
Day # 7
========

Rosie will meet you in the
hotel, and go with her to the
Secret Lab in the Richmond
Building. Inside, you'll find
Duna with another Dinaurian
named Raptin. They're stealing
the idols, which are actually
computers used for a much larger
one. As Rosie tries to stop
them, Raptin zaps her and she
turns into a rat-like creature.
Raptin will zap you, but you'll
just fall unconscious.

When you wake up, a series of
events occurs and Rosie gives
you a pendant. Next thing you
know, you and Diggins are warped
to a Dinaurian ship in space.
The guard there will ask you to
change out of your human
disguises, so you'll back to
make a plan. Diggins tells you
to ask Saurhead for his mask.
But, he won't give it up
willingly. You're gonna have to
fight him for it. Saurhead
requests that you beat him 5
battles in a row without
switching your team. And yes,
this is very annoying. To make
the most of type advantages, put
different types of Vivosaurs in
your team and fill up all five
spots.

Once you've got his mask, head
back to Diggins in the Fossil
Center and go teleport back to
the Dinaurian ship. As you
progress through the ship,
Diggins will speak of a Secret
Island that you have yet to
discover. When you reach the
final room, you will see Duna
with another Dinaurian, Dynal.
When they try to wipe out the
human race, you interfere and
fight a Dinaurian.

Once he is defeated, Dynal turns
the switch on anyways, but
luckily Diggins took one of the
sub-idolcomps. Dynal zaps him
back to the past, and Duna then
teleports you to safety.

Richmond will tell you a little
more about the Secret Island
that Diggins referenced before.
Go to Rosie's room to pick her
up. Then, head into the secret
office to learn of the idol
fragment locations. They are
spread in 5 different locations,
and you have to find the pieces.

In Greenhorn Plains, take a
right and you'll find the idol
fragment buried in the right
corner of the map.

In Knotwood Forest, head to the
VMM and go into the area to the
left of it. The top left is
where you will find the idol
fragment.

In Rivet Ravine, it is right
before the first bridge you see.

In Bottomsup Bay, enter the top
right secret passage in the
ground. The fragment is near the
bottom of the map.

In Mt. Lavaflow, head to the
rightmost tunnel. You'll soon
reach a little offshoot path
that leads nowhere. That is
where the last fragment is.

Once you have all the pieces,
head back to Richmond. He'll
then notify you that you still
need yet another piece. It is on
the Secret Island, and you'll
travel there with Duna.

At the Secret Island, head on
through until you reach the end.
You'll see a specimen and
unfortunately Raptin comes to
try and take it. Take the stone
back to the Fossil Center once
you beat him and clean the stone
up. Who else but Diggins is
inside! Bring the processor to
Richmond. And it turns out that
Dynal was disguised as Richmond.
Poop. Head back to the Dinaurian
ship through Diggins'
teleporter.

Head to the end of the ship and
save before entering the last
room. Dynal is a very big jerk,
so it's fitting that he is an
extremely cheap Vivosaur. His
support effects will cripple
you, so take him out quickly, or
use a Vivosaur that will reduce
his stats greatly also.

After you defeat him, Dynal has
a change of heart. However,
Raptin still wants to kill you
and the human race, so he
activates the computers. But,
like the dummy he is, he only
manages to activate a homing
signal that attracts Guhnash,
the monster who ate the
Dinaurian planet. Great. Gooood
job. Diggins tells you that the
only way to beat Guhnash is to
beat his three (yes three)
brains in battle. You'll then
have the choice of taking either
Rosie or Duna with you to the
final battle. Neither have any
impact on the battle, but
whomsoever you choose will give
you a different ending.

Guhnash's three brains are some
pretty tough cookies, and they
will constantly switch you
around the battlefield. Once you
beat him, you and your partner
will turn to stone and Guhnash
will explode. You'll appear back
