        INTRODUCTION
=============================

Welcome to Ninjatown!  I am Travis Coe, or as the other people know me as on 
the GameFAQs boards, _Raich_. I am a big fan of this game, and after hearing 
about it from E3 reports, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Who doesn't
want to get a game that got multiple nominations for being amazing AND full
of ninjas!

This game was made by Southpeak Games and was released into the U.S.A on the
28th of October.  Oddly enough, I only got this game on the 22nd of December 
and a little more than a week  later I am writing a FAQ for it.  This is my 
first FAQ, and I don't plan on it being my last.


[Verzi]
=============================
      VERSION HISTORY
=============================

Version 0.1 12/31/08
The majority of the planned non-walkthrough stuff is written.
The first Area is completely written


[Basic]
=============================
       BASICS/CONTROLS         
=============================

Ninjatown is a Tower Defense game, based around placement of huts. You spend
cookies (money), on buying different huts or modifier buildings on square lots
to deploy Ninjas to attack your enemies. You can upgrade all of your huts from
I to V (Roman Numerals), and your enemies come in I to V also. Some enemies can
be super fast, super tough, or even flying kind. Your ninjas and enemies will 
take multiple shapes and sizes. But that isn't all!  You also get a hickory 
cane to gather happiness.  It doesn't sound that useful from how I described 
it, but it is essential to success. The cane have 3 notches indicating levels
of happiness obtained from the defeat of your opponents. You use these notches 
to fire off Ol' Master Ninja Powers.  They can be used to destroy enemies, move
your enemies, or even stop time to upgrade huts.  Very, very useful indeed. 


Okay, here is the rundown.

It you tap a lot, you have an option to build Ninjas, Ranged Ninjas, and 
Modifier buildings.  If a Hut is already built on the lot you tapped, you have
a set of options.  For Regular Ninjas, you have the option to Upgrade, Rest, 
Set Rally Point, and Sell.  Upgrade is self-explanatory, Rest makes your Ninjas
leave the battlefield to regain their health, Set Rally Point decides where 
your Regular Ninjas will stay to regain health after battle without leaving the
battlefield (This will be covered more in my advice section), and Sell is 
self-explanatory, but returns back at 3/4ths the cost of it.  For Ranged 
Ninjas, every option is the same except Set Rally Point is replaced with 
Target, which decides whether or not the Ranged Ninjas go after the closest 
enemy, the enemy with the lowest health, and the enemy with the highest health. 
Modifier buildings only have one option when tapped, Sell, which destroys a 
building for 1/2 of the money returned to you, instead of 3/4ths of it.

Upgrades are generally better than building more towers because it is cost 
efficent and makes the game go by quicker.  Also, certain Ninjas cant hit other
enemies unless they are strong enough, like Business Ninja on Chubby Devils or 
the Anti-Ninja on Speedy Devils. As said before, upgrades only happen till the 
hut reaches V, and it cannot be upgraded anymore.

You almost never need to use the Rest, so don't worry about that option.


This game only needs the D-pad, touch screen and microphone to play the game.

D-pad

Moves map around

Microphone

Used for specific Ol' Master powers

Touch Screen

EVERYTHING else.  I'm not kidding.  If you lost your stylus, and forced to use 
a finger, you will find that you will have lots of trouble doing routine things
in this game.


[Rulez]
=============================
    GENERAL RULES TO HELP
=============================

This section is for some more in-depth advice for people who just started the 
game and having a little trouble.

RULE I: 

Rally Points are the key to every fight. If place in a bad spot, it can result 
in multiple unnecessary Ninja deaths.  Have your front line Ninjas at one 
point, and your back up Ninjas at another point.  Have the Front (and Middle) 
Ninjas at right before the edge of their range, and the Back-up Ninjas parallel
with their hut. That way, if a Devil passes by your front line, the Ninjas walk
towards, instead of chase, the Devil. Occasionaly, you won't have a Back-up or 
a middle, but it is impossible to not have a front line. The best general 
set-up for a fight is Anti fronts, Wee middles, and Business back-ups.
Also, you might have to have your forces in a general huddle instead of in a 
line for multi-path courses.

RULE II:

Have your Antis at least one or more levels above the closest Chubby Devil 
Wave. If you can't have that done, have a Wee Devil of an equal level to assist
 you. If they are one level or more (Until IV waves), they are able to 2-hit 
kill, and if they can't do that, then the Wee's can help pick up the slack left 
behind.

RULE III:

Have your Snipers at least two or more levels above the closest Winged Devil 
Wave. Again, if they are two levels or more (Until III waves), they can 2-hit 
kill them.  Since there are two Sniper Ninjas per hut, that makes it VERY 
important to have them like this.

RULE IV:

If overwhelmed with excess Devils passing by your defenses because they are 
pre-occupied with other Devils, use Business Ninjas. They might but weak, but 
they have an uncanny ability to hold back a Devil from moving but getting it 
to lock-on to them.  The only time you generally have to deal with this is a 
time where they are highly important, where you get swamped in Speedy Devils 
and Business Devils.  Business Ninjas are the only Ninjas that can keep them 
back, and they come in very handy during Area 3 Level 3.

More rules to come later in an update.

=============================
   ACTUAL WALKTHROUGH PART
=============================

This section is split up into Areas, then Levels.
The chunk of my updates go into this section, areas at a time.

=============================
      AREA  1 - SUBURBS
=============================

This area is a tutorial level. Occasionaly in their plans, they may make you 
build something here or there, so if they do, do what they say, hit Return to 
map, and go back in. Then you can build freely.

[A1Lv1]
==============================
Area 1 Level 1 - Sleepy Sprawl
==============================

I know the game forces you to make a Wee Ninja hut in the Spot below where I
want you to put it, so after going through the tutorial, like I said before 
just go back to map, and go back in and you can do as you please.

General tips for those who don't want to go step-by-step:

Build some of both types.  Upgrade them when possible inbetween waves.
Make sure to have your Antis one or more levels above the Chubby waves.

Detailed Step-by-Step guide:

Set-up:  Build 1 Wee Ninja on closest to spawn spot on the left and an 
         Anti-Ninja to the opposite side on the right, and another Anti-Ninja
         below him.  Hit the FF button.

During Wave 1:  4 Wee Devil I.  Just sit there.  You should be fine.

Inbetween Wave 1 & 2:  Upgrade Wee Ninja.  Hit the FF button.

During Wave 2:  6 Wee Devil I.  You should be fine.  With Wee Ninja II,
                nothing should be a problem at the moment.

Inbetween Wave 2 & 3:  Upgrade your front Anti-Ninja.  Hit the FF button.

During Wave 3:  6 Wee Devil I again. Your Antis should 2-hit kill them now.

Inbetween Wave 3 & 4:  Upgrade your back Anti-Ninja.  Hit the FF button.

During Wave 4:  4 Chubby Devil I.  This should be your first time with them,
                but if you have an Anti II, then they should be a breeze.

Inbetween Wave 4 & 5:  You don't have the money to do anything.  HTFFB.

During Wave 5:  6 Wee Devil II.  Just sit there and wait.  Not too hard.

Inbetween Wave 5 & 6:  You can upgrade any of them.  Since Wee is the weakest,
                       I normally go with him.  But it's your choice. HTFFB.

During Wave 6:  8 Wee Devil II.  It should be easier now.  One might slip, but
                what do you think your back Antis are for?

Inbetween Wave 6 & 7:  You should have enough to upgrade the other two now.
                       After hitting the upgrade button, HTFFB.

During Wave 7:  10 Wee Devil II. Move up there flags if you want to.

Inbetween Wave 7 & 8:  Upgrade your front Anti-Ninja.  HTFFB.

During Wave 8:  8 Chubby Devil II.  With an Anti-Ninja IV, it should be easy.

Using this strategy, I got an A in under 3 minutes.  But of course pausing and
writing this made it take 20 or so.

==========================
Area 1 Level 2 - Nap Alley
==========================

It seems you are limited to only 4 plots.  It is not as much of a problem as 
it may seem.  Since they make a T, I will refer to them as such.  On this level
you get Ol' Master Powers for the first time.  You get the ability to blow back
enemies if they slide past your defenses.  A very useful ability that will come
in handy.

General Tips for those who don't want to go step-by-step:
  
Build using 3 or 4 plots, probably 4 if you don't go step-by-step. Whatever you
do, make sure that if a devil passed by your defenses, that you use the new
Ol' Master Power to bring him back.

Detailed Step-by-Step Guide:

Set-up:  Make an Anti-Ninja on the left of T.  Make another in the middle of
         the T, and place a Wee Ninja at the bottom of it.  HTFFB.

During Wave 1:  8 Wee Devil I.  So long as you have their flags set up before
                they come, there shouldn't be a problem.

Inbetween Wave 1 & 2:  Upgrade your left Anti-Ninja and HTFFB.

During Wave 2:  8 Wee Devil I.  Should be even easier with a stronger Anti.

Inbetween Wave 2 & 3:  Upgrade your left Anti-Ninja again and HTFFB.

During Wave 3:  6 Chubby Devil I.  With an Anti-Ninja III, they should be 
                easily decimated.

Inbetween Wave 3 & 4:  Upgrade either of the two middle ones.  I went with the
                       Wee Ninja.

During Wave 4:  8 Wee Devil I again.  You shouldn't even have to think to 
                get past this one.

Inbetween Wave 4 & 5:  Upgrade the other one and HTFFB.  Move up flags if
                       you want to.

During Wave 5:  10 Wee Devil I.  The extra numbers shouldn't be a problem.

Inbetween Wave 5 & 6:  Upgrade the left Anti-Ninja again and HTFFB.

During Wave 6:  8 Chubby Devil II.  With a Anti-Ninja IV, this should be a
                piece of cake (pun indeed intended).

Inbetween Wave 6 & 7:  It may seem like a choice, but I highly advise upgrading
                       the Wee Ninja hut.  HTFFB.

During Wave 7:  10 Wee Devil II.  Not much of a problem.  Remember if one
                manages to slip past your defenses, use the new Ol' Master
                Power.

Inbetween Wave 7 & 8:  You can upgrade any of them if you upgraded the Wee
                       Ninja hut last time.  For the sake of killing,
                       I finished off my left Anti-Ninja.  HTFFB.

During Wave 8:  10 Wee Devil II again.  Just sit and relax.

Inbetween Wave 8 & 9:  Upgrade the middle Anti and HTFFB for the next wave of..

During Wave 9:  8 Chubby Devil II.  Should be even easier than last time, since
                you have a Anti-Ninja V now.

Inbetween Wave 9 & 10:  Choices, eh?  The middle two are up for grabs again,
                        and I chose the Wee yet again.  HTFFB.

During Wave 10: 12 Wee Devil II.  Simple as pie.  Get a drink if necessary.

Inbetween Wave 10 & 11:  Upgrade your middle Anti-Ninja to IV and HTFFB.

During Wave 11:  8 Chubby Devil II.  Watch them kill.

Inbetween Wave 11 & 12:  Win.

Using this stategy, you should finish the level with an A and around 5 minutes.
Only if you were unlucky should you have to use the Ol' Master Power.

Area 1 Level 3 - Suger Hill Junction
====================================

This map is a pretty simple one, with only one entrance and one exit, so it
is not much of a problem.  This time however, they give you ranged ninjas for 
your fight against a new type of enemy.  Plus the storyline before the start
of this level is awesome.

General Tips for those who don't want to go step-by-step:

Build 2 or 3 ground attackers and only 1 sniper hut should do.
If you follow RULE III then you shouldn't worry about the Winged Devils.

Detailed Step-by-Step Guide:

Set-up:  Build an Anti-Ninja on the plot closest to the spawn point. Then build
         a Wee Ninja across from it, downwards.  To the left of the Wee, build
         an Anti-Ninja.  HTFFB.

During Wave 1:  8 Wee Devil I.  With your Anti-Ninjas right where they spawn,
                the wave should be simple and quick.

Inbetween Wave 1 & 2:  Upgrade your front Anti-Ninja hut.  HTFFB.

During Wave 2:  10 Wee Devil I.  This wave, again, should be pretty easy, and
                now even easier with an Anti-Ninja II.

Inbetween Wave 2 & 3:  Upgrade the other two huts and HTFFB.

During Wave 3:  6 Chubby Devil I.  Not too hard.  Just watch them kill.

Inbetween Wave 3 & 4:  Build one of your new fancy Sniper Ninja Huts to the
                       right of the front Anti-Ninja. You can also do this 
                       during the next wave.  HTFFB.

During Wave 4:  12 Wee Devil I.  Still easy and not a problem.  During this
                wave if you haven't build a Sniper Hut, build it.

Inbetween Wave 4 & 5:  You MUST get a Sniper Ninja Hut III in order to 2-hit
                       kill them. So upgrade and upgrade and HTFFB. To save
                       some time, you can upgrade during Wave 4 if you have the
                       cookies for it.  Also, set them to target the weakest.

During Wave 5:  8 Winged Devil I.  This is your first time encountering Winged
                Devils, and it certainly won't be your last. Occasionaly, your
                Ninjas will mess up the pattern an skip a Devil and it will get
                away.  If this occurs, then Ol' Master Powers can fix it.

Inbetween Wave 5 & 6:  The next wave coming up is a piece of cake, so upgrade
                       the Wee Ninja if you want, but you shouldn't worry about
                       it.  HTFFB.

During Wave 6:  10 Wee Devil I.  They went down. Too easy.

Inbetween Wave 6 & 7:  Have your front Anti-Ninja and the Wee Ninja upgraded
                       to III. HTFFB.

During Wave 7:  12 Wee Devil I.  Just like 3 waves ago!  Except your stronger.
                This level doesn't really challenge you a whole lot.

Inbetween Wave 7 & 8:  Upgrade your back Anti-Ninja to III and HTFFB.

During Wave 8:  10 Chubby Devil I.  Shouldn't be too hard. Watch the kills.

Inbetween Wave 8 & 9:  Upgrade your Sniper Ninjas to IV.  HTFFB.

During Wave 9:  10 Winged Devil II.  With a Sniper at IV, you should 2-hit kill
                them.  Remember if they misalign, to blow them back.

Inbetween Wave 9 & 10:  At this point, you could get an A without upgrading any
                        of the rest, so upgrade as you please.  I went with my
                        Wee Ninja hut.

During Wave 10:  10 Wee Devil II.  No problem at this point.

Inbetween Wave 10 & 11:  You can upgrade the front Anti-Ninja if you want.
                         HTFFB.

During Wave 11:  12 Wee Devil II.  Still easy.

Inbetween Wave 11 & 12:  I would advise having your back Anti-Ninja at IV.
                         HTFFB.

During Wave 12:  8 Chubby Devil II.  Very easy at this point.

Inbetween Wave 12 & 13:  I maxed my Wee Ninja. You can do what you want. HTFFB.

During Wave 13:  12 Wee Devil II.  EASY!!!!!

Inbetween Wave 13 & 14:  You actually don't need to upgrade your Sniper Hut
                         because it would kill at the same speed as a IV.

During Wave 14:  10 Winged Devil II.  Remember to use the OMP if needed.

Inbetween Wave 14 & 15:  IDK my BFF Jill?  Do what you want. You had the stuff
                         to destroy this wave 5 waves ago.

During Wave 15:  8 Chubby Devil II.  Just like 3 waves ago. E-Z!

Using this strategy, you should finish the level in under 7 minutes with an A
as well.  This level really didn't need a strategy, it was so easy.

===============================
Area 1 Level 4 - Commutersville
===============================

This is your first boss level. It isn't that hard, but the right preparation
should make everything a walk in the park.  This is another one entrance one
exit map, so the map is pretty easy to deal with.

Detailed Step-by-Step Guide:

Set-up:  On the left and right sides of the closest lots to the entrance, put  
         an Anti-Ninja on each.  Below them both, put Wee Ninja huts (the one
         below the left tower is across the street by dojo). HTFFB.

During Wave 1:  8 Wee Devil I.  With 2 Antis, this should be pretty easy.

Inbetween Wave 1 & 2:  Upgrade BOTH Anti-Ninja huts.  HTFFB.

During Wave 2:  8 Chubby Devil I.  Now that your Anti-Ninjas are upgraded, this
                should fly by pretty quick.

Inbetween Wave 2 & 3:  Nothing. Do not upgrade the Wees. Heh, I said Wee.HTFFB.

During Wave 3:  12 Wee Devil I.  During the Wave, make a Sniper Ninja to the
                left of the left Anti-Ninja. Upgrade it once during the wave.

Inbetween Wave 3 & 4:  Upgrade the Sniper Ninja again for the next wave. HTFFB.

During Wave 4:  8 Winged Devil I.  With a Sniper Ninja III, this is pretty
                easy.  If one slips, blow back.

Inbetween Wave 4 & 5:  Upgrade the right Wee Ninja Hut. HTFFB.

During Wave 5:  10 Wee Devil I.  Your left Wee Ninja shouldn't be even
                targeting anything, so upgrade it during the fight to save
                time.

Inbetween Wave 5 & 6:  If your Wee was occupied with battle and you didn't
                       upgrade it, then do it now. HTFFB.

During Wave 6:  8 Chubby Devil I.  They shouldn't even pass your Antis, lest
                alone your Wees.

Inbetween Wave 6 & 7:  Upgrade your Sniper Hut one more time. Even though it
                       isn't maxed, it should be the last time you need to
                       upgrade it.  HTFFB.

During Wave 7:  10 Wee Devil II. Despite their upgrade, they keep their
                simplicity to defeat.

Inbetween Wave 7 & 8:  Upgrade the two Anti huts. You can do it now or before
                       wave 9. HTFFB.

During Wave 8:  10 Winged Devil II. With two Sniper Ninja IVs firing at the
                enemies, they don't stand a chance.

Inbetween Wave 8 & 9:  Make sure your Antis are III and one of your Wees are
                       III before the next wave. HTFFB.

During Wave 9:  10 Wee Devil II. Still easy to wipe the floor with. To save
                time, you can upgrade your Wee Ninja hut II to III.

Inbetween Wave 9 & 10:  Upgrade the Wee if you haven't already. All of your
                        huts should be III and your Sniper should be IV. HTFFB.

During Wave 10:  10 Chubby Devil II. Your team of Antis should take care of the
                 job pretty easily.

Inbetween Wave 10 & 11: Upgrade your Antis to IV. HTFFB.

During Wave 11:  15 Wee Devil II. First odd number for a wave.  This wave
                 should be pretty easy despite the enhanced numbers.

Inbetween Wave 11 & 12:  Upgrade both your Wee Devils to IV. Everybody now
                         should be at IV.  Once you are ready, HTFFB. Here's
                         Mister Boss!

During Wave 12:  3 Super Wee Devil.  These guys may look tough, but trust me,
                 they aren't as bad as they look. You should notice that they
                 have a splash move as an attack. This may ending up to killing
                 all 8 of your Ninjas at once if they fumble too much.  Since
                 they are immune to wind, I recommend going to the Spot right
                 next to the left Wee Ninja and build an Anti-Ninja and     
                 constantly try to upgrade the Ninja. However odd as it sounds,
                 if they kill your Ninjas, I would stop upgrading them and let
                 them loose to finish off the Bosses. It isn't often where they
                 are needed, but when they are, you will be glad you have them.

Using this strategy, you should finish the level around 5 1/2 to 6 minutes with
an A. This is the finish for Area 1.
