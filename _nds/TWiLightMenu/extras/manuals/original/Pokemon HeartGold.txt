NEXT EXPECTED UPDATE: Version 2.50 - It's taking longer than expected! Sorry!
                                     Trying to get Locations up soon. Am also
                                     making corrections by various people who
                                     sent in emails. Thanks all! Also working
                                     on Johto Gym tips.

ABOUT THIS FAQ:

==============================================================================

This is a walkthrough of Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. There are going
to be detailed sections on the locations, trainers, and other things in
the game.

I added a "How can you help" section, and I would appreciate it if you read
over it!

I hope this FAQ is the sort of thing you are looking for. Updates will come
slower than other FAQs, but that is because of the vast amount of detail that
I will be putting into the FAQ. :) The Table of Contents will show the
upcoming section, but not the ones afterward.

Keep checking back for each update. An update will mean a whole new section
from the contents has been added.

If you have any suggestions/questions/comments, see contact info!

Onward!

==============================================================================

WALKTHROUGH [WLK]

==============================================================================

This is the "walkthrough" section, where I will detail where to go, trainers
to battle, Pokemon to catch in the area, etc. Basically, the course of the
story.

It will tell you where to go, who to battle, etc. However, it will not give
specifics, as they are covered in their own sections.

Trainers will be covered in the walkthrough, by name and the Pokemon they have
and the awards with it. For Pokemon, they are covered in the LOCATIONS section
of the FAQ. SHOPS are covered in the LOCATIONS section as well.

Below is a quick reference list:

World, and can be used for reference where any place is:

============================ JOHTO JOURNEY [JHT] =============================

This is essentially the first half of the game, up to the Indigo Plateau!

***************************** BEGINNINGS [CH1] *******************************

This chapter covers from the starting of the game to learning how to catch
Pokemon.

As soon as you start the game, you will be prompted to learn the controls.
Choose "No Info Needed" to continue.

You will now see Professor Oak, and the background information begins.

Select your Gender. Enter your name. And the game will begin. :)

---------------------------- NEW BARK TOWN [001] -----------------------------

You will start off in your room. Go downstairs and your mother will begin
to talk to you automatically.

You will receive a BAG, TRAINER CARD, the SAVE function, and OPTIONS function.
These are all accessed using the touch screen.

After receiving these items, head outside the door, and see a minor event.

Head west to PROFESSOR ELM's LABORATORY, the building in the top left of the
Town.

Speak to PROFESSOR ELM (top part of the lab), and then proceed to the machine
with three POKEBALLS. Choose your STARTER Pokemon!

After doing so, you will speak to PROFESSOR ELM again. He will then tell you
to go slightly North of CHERRYGROVE, so, let's get going!

You will receive five POTIONS from the AIDE on your way out.

When you get out of the lab, you will run into your friend. They will remark 
on the Pokemon you chose, and suggests you see your MOTHER, so let's do that.

Go back to your home, and speak to your MOTHER, she will give you the
POKEGEAR.

Now leave, and head out NEW BARK TOWN to the west. PROFESSOR ELM will stop you
to give you his phone number, which will be added to the POKEGEAR.

Now head west!

------------------------------- ROUTE 29 [002] -------------------------------

You can encounter Pokemon throughout this Route. Make your way west through
the route, it is a pretty linear path.

Head down and west, through the Tall Grass. It is a good idea to get some
training done for your Pokemon, but you can take short routes through the
Tall Grass if you just want to get through quickly.

When you reach a point where there is an opening in the ledges (with the boy
on the left side who tells you about Tall Grass), go north, then east and
north again through the L shaped tall grass.

There should be a Gatehouse to the north, but just keep going west for now.

There is a boy on a ledge with an APRICORN TREE, but you cannot obtain any
right now as you do not have proper methods to carry it; so, jump off the
ledge going down, and follow the road to the west.

You will enter CHERRYGROVE CITY.

--------------------------- CHERRYGROVE CITY [003] ---------------------------

As soon as you enter, an old man will stop you. He will show you around the
town, and explain the functions of different buildings.

After he shows you his house, you will obtain the RUNNING SHOES! This will
make travelling just a bit faster. :)

Now go to the Pokemon Center, heal up your Pokemon, and then leave the
Pokemon Center to the west, and then leave the city north.

On your way out, the kind old man will give you a TOWN MAP card, which can be
accessed on the POKEGEAR. 

Now leave north to ROUTE 30.

------------------------------- ROUTE 30 [004] -------------------------------

Head east and pick up the POTION. Now head north to a house with an APRICORN
TREE next to it. Go inside, and talk to the man to receive the APRICORN BOX,
now you can pick up APRICORNS as you come across them!

Head outside, and pick up the GRN APRICORN, then head east and up the path.

At the top where the tall grass ends, you will notice an item to the left,
examine it to receive an ANTIDOTE.

North there is a fork, but the left side is blocked off by two Pokemon
Trainers having a battle, so head up the east path.

You will eventually come to a dead end, with a house and an APRICORN TREE,
this house is MR. POKEMON's house, the one PROFESSOR ELM wanted us to see.

So pick up the PNK APRICORN, then head into the house.

You will receive the MYSTERY EGG, and your Pokemon will be healed. Then,
PROFESSOR OAK will speak to you, and you will receive the POKEDEX!

You will also receive PROFESSOR OAK's number.

Head outside and you will get a call from PROFESSOR ELM. A distress call, it
seems, so let's head back!

Head south, now backtracking where you came from. When you reach the fork,
head to the left instead of the tall grass, then down the path and hop the
ledge if you want to avoid Pokemon.

You will eventually reach CHERRYGROVE CITY again.

Note: Since you received the Pokedex, you can now trade in Pokemon from other
games as well as battle other players inside the Pokemon Center's second
floor!

--------------------------- CHERRYGROVE CITY [005] ---------------------------

Head to the Pokemon Center to the right to rest up your Pokemon, then prepare
to leave the city east, to Route 029.

You will be interuppted by a boy, who will then challenge you to your first
Pokemon Battle!

PASSERBY BOY (500P)* (If you chose CHIKORITA)

 -CYNDAQUIL LV 5
  -Ability: Blaze
  -Type: Fire
   Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Leer [Normal/Status]

PASSERBY BOY (500P)* (If you chose CYNDAQUIL)

 -TOTODILE LV 5
  -Ability: Torrent
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Scratch [Normal/Physical]
   Leer [Normal/Status]

PASSERBY BOY (500P)* (If you chose TOTODILE)

 -CHIKORITA LV 5 (M)
  -Ability: Overgrow
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Growl [Normal/Status]

After this, head back to the Pokemon Center, heal up, then head back east out
into Route 029.

------------------------------- ROUTE 29 [006] -------------------------------

Follow the yellow road east to where there is a girl, then hop the southern
ledge and head east to make it back to New Bark Town quickly.

You can make a detour to grab the APRICORN we ran across earlier, but that
can wait if you do not wish to do so.

Head east into New Bark Town.

---------------------------- NEW BARK TOWN [007] -----------------------------

Head to PROFESSOR ELM's LABORATORY. You will be in an event where a Policeman
asks you information (after accusing you...)

You can now name your RIVAL.

You will then give the MYSTERY EGG to PROFESSOR ELM. 

He then suggests you take on the GYM CHALLENGE! Well, why not? But first, talk
to your MOTHER.

Head out and back to your house. Speak to your MOTHER, and she will ask if
you want her to save money or not. This is up to you, by doing so, she buys
various items for you on her own, but you obviously don't keep as much prize
money with you.

You can come back and withdraw money at any time.

Afterwards, head out of New Bark Town.

------------------------------- ROUTE 29 [008] -------------------------------

You will run into your friend, who will teach you how to catch Pokemon. After
that, you will receive five POKE BALLs from them.

Now that you can catch Pokemon, I suggest you capture every Pokemon you
encounter to help build your party.

With this now learned, we are all set to begin the GYM CHALLENGE! Head to
CHERRYGROVE CITY to the west, and into Chapter 2 of this Walkthrough.

***************************** FIRST BADGE [CH2] ******************************

This chapter will cover from you learning how to Catch Pokemon all the way to
defeating the first GYM LEADER.

--------------------------- CHERRYGROVE CITY [009] ---------------------------

Back in Cherrygrove, heal up your Pokemon if you need to. Now head north into
Route 030!

------------------------------- ROUTE 30 [010] -------------------------------

Go through the patches of grass, and past the house where you had received
the APRICORN BOX from. You should reach that split in the road.

Remember the previously blocked off Road? Well it's open now, and there are
some trainers willing to fight.

YOUNGSTER JOEY (64P) PokeGear

 -RATTATA LV 4 (M) 48 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Quick Attack [Normal/Physical]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

Just got a bit north, and you will run into

YOUNGSTER MIKEY (64P)

 -PIDGEY LV 2 (M) 22 EXP
  -Type: Flying

   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -RATTATA LV 4 (M) 48 EXP
  -Type: Normal

With that done, keep going north, pass the silly Trainer Tips sign, and you
will run into

BUG CATCHER DON (48P)

 -CATERPIE LV 3 (M) 33 EXP
  -Type: Bug

 -CATERPIE LV 3 (M) 33 EXP
  -Type: Bug
  -Moves:

   String Shot [Bug/Status]

After him, go north and up the steps. The cuttable tree to the east leads to
Mr. Pokemon's house.

------------------------------- ROUTE 31 [011] -------------------------------

Go right through the grass, as we can't cut down the tree for a shortcut. When
you turn the corner, you will see a boy next to the cave. Don't worry, he is
not a trainer.

That cave is DARK CAVE, which we do not have to go into yet. Grab the POTION
to the left of the cave, then head down the stairs to the west. There will
be an APRICORN TREE next to a man, who is not a trainer. Grab the BLK APRICORN
from the tree. Keep this man in mind, as there is a mini-quest you can do to
bring the man a friend's letter to receive a TM.

To the south is the only Trainer on this route;

BUG CATCHER WADE (32P) PokeGear

 -CATERPIE LV 2 (M) 22 EXP
  -Type: Bug

 -CATERPIE LV 2 (M) 22 EXP
  -Type: Bug
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   String Shot [Bug/Status]

Then grab the POKE BALL to his right, then head west across the grass, north
onto the pathway, and west into the border house; which goes into VIOLET
CITY!

Note: While you're in the area; you should look for a BELLSPROUT, as you will
be able to trade it for an ONYX in the next area.

------------------------------ VIOLET CITY [012] -----------------------------

In the Borderhouse, you should have received the VS. RECORDER from Ethan/Lyra.

There is a lot to do in this city; I will give you only what you need to
progress in the story. More detailed information can be seen in the Locations
section of the FAQ.

First, heal up at the Pokemon Center. Then, head up north, across the bridges,
and you will see a Pagoda (tower); go inside.

----------------------------- SPROUT TOWER [013] -----------------------------

Once inside, climb the ladder in the top left, to reach the second floor.

SPROUT TOWER 2F

Head to the right and fight

SAGE NICO (144P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP

  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

Afterwards, head right and up to the ladder that goes back to the first floor.

SPROUT TOWER 1F

Go straight down to get the PARLYZ HEAL. Then go back to the ladder and go
left. You will eventually face

SAGE CHOW (144P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP

  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

After him, go up the ladder below back to the second floor.

SPROUT TOWER 2F

Go up to get the X ACCURACY, then go straight down, and you will run into

SAGE EDMOND (144P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP

  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 3 (M) 54 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

These guys are getting a bit repetitive, huh?

Anyway, head right and up the ladder to the third floor.

SPROUT TOWER 3F

Go left and get the POTION. And then get ready for three battles as you make
your way to the top of the room.

The first man who will battle you is

SAGE JIN (288P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 6 (M) 108 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

The second man, in the middle;

SAGE NEAL (288P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 6 (M) 108 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

After him, head to the final man, on the right side of the center pillar; he
is:

SAGE TROY (336P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 7 (M) 126 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Growth [Grass/Status]
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -HOOTHOOT LV 7 (M) 87 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying

Now, head to the left around the pillar, you will run into your RIVAL, but no
worries, you do not fight him here.

After the little scene, go to the top right of the room to get the ESCAPE
ROPE.

Now, go and speak to the ELDER to begin the battle. If your Pokemon are weak,
you can backtrack down the tower and heal them at the Pokemon Center. He isn't
too hard, though:

ELDER LI (1200P)

 -BELLSPROUT LV 7 (M) 126 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Growth [Normal/Status]
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -BELLSPROUT LV 7 (M) 126 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves
   Growth [Normal/Status]
   Vine Whip [Grass/Physical]

 -HOOTHOOT LV 10 (M) 122 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Growl [Normal/Status]

You will then receive TM70 FLASH, after teaching it to a Pokemon, you will
be able to explore the DARK CAVE with ease. The walkthrough will not include
it, however, check sidequests for more details on that.

Now, you can either use the ESCAPE ROPE to return to the entrance, or just
backtrack through the tower to the entrance, it's pretty linear, and your
Pokemon will get additional training, either way, head back outside to
VIOLET CITY. Time to take the GYM LEADER!

------------------------------ VIOLET CITY [014] -----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center, then head to VIOLET CITY GYM, located west
of the Trainer's school. I advise you bring an Electric or Rock Pokemon, or
anything that is anti-flying. Those are just two examples. :)

---------------------------- VIOLET CITY GYM [015] ---------------------------

Proceed forward onto the platform in the center, it will take you up to
where the trainers and GYM LEADER are.

If you wish to skip the trainers, simply walk on the hollow platforms that
go around the edges, and make your way to the leader. I will go with assuming
you are fighting the trainers too, so head forward and begin a battle with:

BIRD KEEPER ABE (288P)

 -SPEAROW LV 9 (M) 110 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves
   Leer [Normal/Status]
   Growl [Normal/Status]
   Peck [Flying/Physical]
   Fury Attack [Normal/Physical]

Then the next trainer;

BIRD KEEPER ROD (224P)

 -PIDGEY LV 7 (M) 80 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves*
   Sand-Attack [Ground/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -PIDGEY LV 7 (M) 80 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves*
   Sand-Attack [Ground/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

And finally, the GYM LEADER: He's pretty easy if you have anti-bird Pokemon.
There aren't too many tips to give for this battle, good luck!

LEADER FALKNER (1560P)

 -PIDGEY LV 9 (M) 104 EXP
  -Ability: Keen Eye
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Sand-Attack [Ground/Status]

 -PIDGEOTTO LV 13 (M) 312 EXP
  -Ability: Keen Eye
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves: 
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Roost [Flying/Status]
   Gust [Flying/Special]

After this, you will receive the ZEPHYR BADGE, allowing you to use ROCK SMASH
outside of battle, as well as all Pokemon up to the level 20 obeying you.

You will also receive TM51 ROOST.

Now, head outside the GYM.

------------------------------ VIOLET CITY [016] -----------------------------

You will get a call from PROFESSOR ELM. He will tell you to pick up an EGG
from the aide in the Poke Mart! If you want to hold it, you have to
make room in your Pokemon party for it.

Go to the Poke Mart on the left, and inside the aide is standing on the right
(the man with the glasses.) If there is a Red Deliveryboy here, that means
your MOTHER has also bought you a gift, so pick that up while you're here too!

When you exit the mart, You will run into a somewhat odd cutscene.

Also, now that you defeated the GYM LEADER, you can receive the PAL PAD from
the Pokemon Center. So, exit the Poke Mart, and head back to the Pokemon
Center, and down the escalator to the right.

You will receive the PAL PAD from Teala automatically upon entry.

Now leave VIOLET CITY south to Route 32; south of the Poke Mart and past the
APRICORN TREE (grab the YLW APRICORN if you haven't already) and out into
the Route!

***************************** SECOND BADGE [CH3] ******************************

This chapter covers from leaving VIOLET CITY (after acquiring the ZEPHYR
BADGE) to obtaining the SECOND BADGE from AZALEA TOWN.

------------------------------- ROUTE 32 [017] -------------------------------

From here, if you go left, you can make it to the Ruins of Alph, but at this
point they are not significant to progressing. If you want more info on it,
see the SIDEQUESTS info as well as LOCATIONS part of the FAQ.

Anyway, proceed south to a man. He is not a trainer, instead, he will give
you the MIRACLE SEED. You have to have gotten the ZEPHYR BADGE and the
POKEMON EGG for him to let you through.

Heading south, you will eventually run into:

YOUNGSTER ALBERT (128P)

 -RATTATA LV 6 (M) 72 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

 -ZUBAT LV 8 (M) 90 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying
  -Moves:
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]
   Leech Life [Bug/Physical]

There is a cuttable tree to the left, but as you probably do not have cut,
just keep going down.

When you reach a fork, one going left into the tall grass, and one going
right onto a road. Go to the left first, and you should see an item in the
grass; it's a REPEL.

Now either backtrack to the fork, or just go south out of the field, they
lead to the same place. If you feel like having another fight (which I
highly recommend), then go to the rightside (where the road is) and talk
to the girl who is facing the wall, turns out it's:

PICNICKER LAZ (128P) PokeGear

 -NIDORAN LV 8 (F) 98 EXP
  -Type: POISON
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

After her, follow the road down. You will eventually come to a place where
there is a set of stairs that leads down to a dock with FISHERMEN on it, but
I will assume you will be going straight down, then coming back this way in
order to fight all the trainers and get the item.

So; going down, you will fight:

CAMPER ROLAND (144P)

 -NIDORAN LV 9 (M) 114 EXP
  -Type: Poison

After him, go down and right into the field, and at the top of the field is
a GREAT BALL.

Now go to the stairs right near the bottom of the field, but don't go down
them; instead, go left and down the patch of tall grass to get TM09 BULLET
SEED.

Now backtrack to the fork earlier (with the stairs that goes down to the
docks or to the road.) Go down the stairs now.

Pass the little patch of grass onto the dock, and then head south. You will
see two fishermen staring out to see. They are easy experience for your
Pokemon.

Talk to the one on the left; he is:

FISHERMAN HENRY (256P)

 -POLIWAG LV 8 (M) 132 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Water Sport [Water/Status]
   Hypnosis [Psychic/Status]
   Bubble [Water/Special]

 -POLIWAG LV 8 (M) 132 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Water Sport [Water/Status]
   Hypnosis [Psychic/Status]
   Bubble [Water/Special]

Then, talk to the one facing south. He is:

FISHERMAN JUSTIN (160P)

 -MAGIKARP LV 5 (M) 21 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

 -MAGIKARP LV 15 (M) 63 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -MAGIKARP LV 5 (M) 21 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

 -MAGIKARP LV 5 (M) 21 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

Afterwards, head right and you will run into:

FISHERMAN RALPH (320P) PokeGear

 -GOLDEEN LV 10 (M) 237 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Peck [Flying/Physical]
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]
   Water Sport [Water/Status]
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]

After him (and his depressing comments if you say no), head down and out
of the docks. Then follow the road to the trainer:

YOUNGSTER GORDON (160P)

 -WOOPER LV 10 (M) 111 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Mud Shot [Ground/Special]
   Water Gun [Water/Special]

After him, head south, and you will see a man who sells...SLOWPOKE TAIL,
yum.

Well, it's a rip off. And very shady, anyway. Anyway, the Pokemon Center to
the right is the more interesting part! Head inside.

Heal up, and be sure to talk to the FISHERMAN to receive an OLD ROD. You can
now catch MAGIKARP at pretty much any body of water you see! Also, for
instructions on how to use the rod, speak to him again.

Also talk to the man in the bottom left of the Pokemon Center, and answer
"Yes" to receive 2 LURE BALLS!

Now head back outside, and straight down, you will run into:

BIRD KEEPER PETER (256P)

 -PIDGEY LV 6 (M) 70 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Sand Attack [Normal/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -PIDGEY LV 6 (M) 70 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Sand Attack [Normal/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -SPEAROW LV 8 (M) 98 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Leer [Normal/Status]
   Growl [Normal/Status]

If you got damaged during the battle, head back and heal up at the Pokemon
Center in the north, then come back.

There is a rock smashable rock there with an item behind it, you could have
actually have ROCK SMASH by now, but I did not include it in the WALKTHROUGH
thus far as it is not a requirement, and we head back that way anyway so
it should not be a problem. :)

Head into UNION CAVE!

------------------------------- UNION CAVE [018] -----------------------------

Okay, first, I am just going to get you where you need to go, meaning I will
not detour you to other floors; as you can't explore much without all of the
HMs in your possession anyway. But, I will tell you where the stairs are in
case you want to anyway, as there are some items you can grab without the use
of HMs you won't have at this point.

Anyway, head left, and you will reach a north/south fork. Go up and fight:

FIREBREATHER RAY (288P)

 -VULPIX LV 9 (F) 120 EXP
  -Type: Fire
  -Moves:
   Roar [Normal/Status]

Behind him is a staircase that will take you to BASEMENT 1F (B1F), but I will
not cover that yet. The UNION CAVE's full exploration will be covered in the
SIDEQUESTS, and a summary in LOCATIONS.

Now head south from the FIREBREATHER, and take a left into the small area
where there is an X ATTACK.

Now go back to the fork, and head south, you will run into:

HIKER DANIEL (352P)

 -ONIX LV 11 (M) 253 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock
  -Moves:
   Screech [Normal/Status]
   Harden [Normal/Status]

From him, head right and you will run into:

HIKER RUSSEL (256P)

 -GEODUDE LV 4 (M) 62 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground

 -GEODUDE LV 8 (M) 124 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground

 -GEODUDE LV 6 (M) 93 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground

Now head right, and you will go into a narrow path that turns downward. Keep
going until you reach a fork. If you go right, you can fight a trainer, if
you go left, you can get an item and skip the trainer. I'll send you both
ways.

Go left first, and then go left along the very narrow path over the body of
water. At the end is an item, pick it up, it's a POTION. Now go back to the
right side, where the FIREBREATHER is, but avoid his eye contact first, and
obtain the GREAT BALL.

Now, fight the FIREBREATHER:

FIREBREATHER BILL (192P)

 -KOFFING LV 6 (M/) 145 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Smog [Poison/Special]

 -KOFFING LV 6 (M/) 145 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Smog [Poison/Special]

Now head south from him and onto the little path that runs on the right side
of the body of water, you will eventually run into:

POKE MANIAC LARRY (704P)

 -SLOWPOKE LV 11 (M) 228 EXP
  -Type: Water/Psychic
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Yawn [Normal/Status]
   Growl [Normal/Status]
   Water Gun [Water/Special]

He is the last trainer you have to fight in this cave (for now). Head right,
when you reach another fork, ignore the left path as it goes to a dead end.

You should be able to see the exit to Route 33, grab the AWAKENING nearby the
exit and head out!

------------------------------- ROUTE 33 [019] -------------------------------

There are two APRICORN TREES if you head south, containing a PNK APRICORN
and BLK APRICORN. That person is not a trainer, so don't worry about it.

Then head west and you will run into:

HIKER ANTHONY (352P) PokeGear

 -GEODUDE LV 11 (M) 171 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground

 -MACHOP LV 11 (M) 175 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Fighting/Status]

There is something about them making you feel guilty if you don't accept.

Anyway, head west along the road, and you will enter the border to AZALEA
TOWN.

------------------------------- AZALEA TOWN [020] ----------------------------

Keep heading west and you will see a little scene with a man in black. How
very nice of him!

Anyway, head west into the actual town itself, and heal up at the Pokemon
Center, and take a look around.

You will notice you cannot enter the GYM yet...another man in black is in
the way.

When you've explored the town, go to the upper left most house, this is KURT's
HOUSE, and speak to him. He will dash off toward where we just saw that scene.

Head outside, grab the WHT APRICORN right next to his house, and head back
to where the TEAM ROCKET GRUNT was standing earlier (that is, the man in
black.)

You will notice he is gone. Let's head into the SLOWPOKE WELL, which you just
go down the ramp and into the hole.

------------------------------ SLOWPOKE WELL [021] ---------------------------

Speak to KURT, then head into the entrance to the west.

SLOWPOKE WELL 1F:

While you won't actually go to any other floor, I will still point this out
anyway. You will need more HMs you don't have to explore the whole cave, which
you can see in the SIDEQUESTS section. For now, let's just get rid of TEAM
ROCKET!

Go straight up and run into:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (360P)

 -RATTATA LV 9 (M) 109 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Quick Attack [Normal/Physical]

 -RATTATA LV 9 (M) 109 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Quick Attack [Normal/Physical]

Now go north and wind around the rock, and grab the SUPER POTION.

Now fight the next TEAM ROCKET GRUNT:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (440P)

 -ZUBAT LV 9 (F) 103 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

 -EKANS LV 11 (F) 145 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Bite [Dark/Physical]
   Poison Sting [Poison/Physical]

After her, head down the stairs and to the left to face:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (360P)

 -RATTATA LV 7 (M) 85 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

 -ZUBAT LV 9 (M) 103 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

 -ZUBAT LV 9 (M) 103 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

After him, head up north to the one with different colored hair, he's their
boss, let's take him out!

EXECUTIVE PROTON (480P)

 -ZUBAT LV 8 (M) 91 EXP
  -Ability: Inner Focus
  -Type: Poison/Flying
  -Moves:
   Leech Life [Bug/Physical]
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]

 -KOFFING LV 12 (M) 292 EXP
  -Ability: Levitate
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Poison Gas [Poison/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]
   Smog [Poison/Special]
   SmokeScreen [Normal/Status]

After this battle, all the TEAM ROCKET members will disappear, and KURT will
talk to you.

You will now be in KURT's house, where he gives you a FAST BALL and asks if
you have any APRICORNS for him. You can give him any color and he will make
it into a corresponding ball (see LOCATIONS for more detail.)

After that, his granddaughter will give you his phone number (if you want it.)

Leave his house back into AZALEA TOWN.

------------------------------- AZALEA TOWN [022] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center, and then head for AZALEA TOWN GYM! We can now
get the SECOND BADGE.

----------------------------- AZALEA TOWN GYM [023] --------------------------

You can pick up tips from the man in the first room. He advises FIRE and
FLYING type Pokemon, so do I. It will make this GYM very easy. Proceed to the
next room.

You will see three Spiders in front of you, these are actually platforms. I'm
going to make you fight all the trainers in here, but if you want to skip
them, just look for which platform proceeds ahead instead of into a trainer
below.

To fight a trainer, go onto the center platform; it will take you to:

BUG CATCHER AL (192P)

 -CATERPIE LV 12 (M) 135 EXP
  -Type: Bug
  -Moves:
   String Shot [Bug/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

 -WEEDLE LV 12 (M) 133 EXP
  -Type: Bug/Poison

Then step back on the platform and it will take you back to the center. Now,
to proceed, go onto the platform on the left side.

Right in front of you is:

BUG CATCHER BENNY (192P)

  -Type: Bug/Poison
  -Moves:

You will notice a switch in front of you. If you want to fight the trainer in
the top right, flip it. If not, then don't flip it.

Flip it; and you will run into:

BUG CATCHER JOSH (208P)

 -PARAS LV 13 (M) 194 EXP
  -Type: Bug/Grass
  -Moves:
   Stun Spore [Grass/Status]
   Scratch [Normal/Physical]
   Leech Life [Bug/Physical]

Jump back on to return to where you started. Now flip the switch back to it's
original position.

Now back on the lift, you will run into a pair of twins; prepare for a double
battle!

After you beat him, you will receive the HIVE BADGE and TM89. Now, flip the
blue switch, then jump on the platform, and backtrack and make your way out
of the GYM and into Azalea Town.

------------------------------- AZALEA TOWN [024] ----------------------------

Heal up, and make all preparations you will need before heading into the
ILEX FOREST to the west of this town.

If you have the Pikachu-colored Pichu (the event Pokemon); then be sure to
bring that along with you.

Head out west into ILEX FOREST.

****************************** THIRD BADGE [CH4] *****************************

This covers everything up to acquiring the GOLDENROD CITY GYM BADGE, that is,
the third badge of the game.

------------------------------ ILEX FOREST [025] -----------------------------

When you enter, just follow the path along until you run into a boy standign
next to the cuttable tree. Talk to him and find out you're supposed to
retrieve a lost Pokemon for him.

So let's do that, it's not as hard as it sounds.

Go right, and down the L-shaped path, you will notice the FARFETCH'D facing
to the right. So; step on the first set of branches, and it will face down.

Now, avoid the second set of branches in the top right, and take the path
on the right side to come all the way around behind the FARFETCH'D. Simply
walk up behind it (from the top, since it's facing down), and push A.

You will automatically be taken back to the boy, who will tell you to get the
other one. No problem!

Head back to where you found the first FARFETCH'D, but this time follow the
path in the bottom right. Make a quick detour to grab the REVIVE, then keep
going right. You will notice one branch here. Step on it to make the
Pokemon face downward. Now go up the left path and push A, yes, it will run
away.

Don't worry, that was supposed to happen. Now it should be facing left in
it's new location, go forward, then up to the set of twigs on top. Stepping
on this should make the Pokemon face up. Then go to the right and down to that
set of twigs (on the right) to make the Pokemon face right.

Now, go back up and around the top twigs, don't step on them! And come up
behind the FARFETCH'D, and that's it!

The "Boss" will then come and award you with HM01 CUT, meaning you can cut
down all cuttable trees now. Teach it to a Pokemon that is capable, and cut
the tree down. Most starter Pokemon can learn it, but I advise you teach it
to a Pokemon of your own choice rather than forcing it upon one that you will
likely use more often. :)

Anyway, right after you cut that tree down, you will be at the Ilex Shrine!

If you have the EVENT PICHU, set it to your first Pokemon, and examine the
shrine, this will activate the SPIKEY-EARED PICHU EVENT! For more details
on this, check the EVENT section of this FAQ.

Anyway; head left and up the L-shaped path, and you will come to a sign
near a body of water. Go right from here, and you will notice a short L-shaped
detour, go in this detour to get the X ATTACK.

Now get back out onto the main path and keep heading up. Then head right. You
will notice a man facing the trees on the bottom area, but you can't get to
him by going down. Instead, keep going along the path and eventually you will
come to a fork, one going up to a lady and one path going right.

If you want to meet the curious man, go to the right, and follow the path
which will lead you right to him. Speak to him and he will teach your Pokemon
the move HEADBUTT, which can be used to knock Pokemon out of trees! You can
use this to acquire Pokemon in certain areas you could not before. He will
teach it as many times as you want him to.

After you speak to him, hop off the ledge to the left and go back to the fork
where you can choose to go up or right.

This time, go up, and the KIMONO GIRL will automatically start talking to you.

Say "Yes" to her, and your lead Pokemon will show her the way out. Go grab
the item on the right side, it's an ETHER.

Now follow the path left, where she left. Keep going and you will see that
you are north of the same body of water you saw before. You will notice an
item on the little island, but we don't have SURF so we can't do much about
that.

So; keep going left and you will see the exit, and you're done with this
place, for now! No trainers!

In the borderhouse, talk to the girl with the BUTTERFREE, and you will receive
TM12 TAUNT.

------------------------------- ROUTE 34 [026] -------------------------------

Follow the road; you will run into:

Now, get back on the road, and go north. You will eventually run into ETHAN/
LYRA and a cutscene regarding the DAYCARE. You will also register ETHAN/LYRA
into the POKEGEAR! About time.

Leave the house, and you will receive the DAY-CARE MAN and DAY-CARE LADY's
numbers in your POKEGEAR!

Now keep heading north on the road. If it is nighttime where you are, then
the security guard will battle you, if it's not night, then he won't.

If he battles you;

POLICEMAN KEITH (680P)

 -GROWLITHE LV 17 (M) 330 EXP
  -Type: Fire
  -Moves:
   Ember [Fire/Special]
   Leer [Normal/Status]

  -Type: Water

   Disable [Normal/Status]
   Scratch [Normal/Physical]

After him, go into the grass to get TM63 EMBARGO. Now get back on the road.

While you're here, you should catch a DROWZEE so you can trade for a MACHOP
in GOLDENROD CITY.

And now just follow the road into GOLDENROD CITY!

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [027] ----------------------------

There is a lot to do here! I advise you check every building in this city to
see what you can get, I'll give you a brief run through, as some of the items
are not required for story progression, but certainly will be convenient!

So first things first, go to the Pokemon Center and heal up!

After that, visit the DEPARTMENT STORE, on the right, the tall building. You
can buy a lot here, you can check the LOCATION section of my guide for
details. There is also a man offering a MACHOP for a DROWZEE, so trade with
him if you want.

If you take the elevator to the basement, you can obtain some items that are
lying around. They are an ULTRA BALL, an ETHER, and a BURN HEAL. You have to
talk to the people there to get their MACHOKE to move the containers out of
the way.

Back out of the DEPARTMENT STORE, head northwest to the GAME CORNER, and go
inside and talk to the man on the chair. He will give you a COIN CASE when
you say "Yes." You can play his mini-game if you want.

Outside again, go to the northeast part of the city with a boy who talks about
a BIKE SHOP. Follow the winding path downward and eventually you will come
across it. Go inside and speak to the man to receive the BICYCLE! Even faster
than the running shoes.

Now go to the northwest part of the city, where there is a black building.
This is the RADIO TOWER, with a TEAM ROCKET member standing outside of it,

Go inside and talk to the lady on the far right side of the counter to begin 
the QUIZ to acquire a RADIO CARD.

The answers are (in this order):

Question: "Can you check the Town Map with your Pokegear?"
Answer: YES

Question: "NIDORINA can only be female. True?"
Answer: YES

Question: "Kurt, the Poke Ball creator, uses apricots as ingredients?"
Answer: NO

Question: "It's impossible to use a TM on MAGIKARP. True?"
Answer: YES

Question: "In Professor Oak's popular show, Pokemon Talk, is he on with
           Marie?"
Answer: NO

You will now be able to listen to the RADIO on your POKEGEAR. Also, you just
got GYM LEADER WHITNEY to go back to her GYM!

Go upstairs and talk to BUENA if you want the BLUE CARD (she is on the bottom
right of the second floor.)

On your way out, try your luck with the LOTTERY, you just may win something!

Take note of the GLOBAL TERMINAL to the west here. It is not story relevant,
but can certainly help you out!

Now to continue with the story, go north under the bridge and you will see
a building next to a funny looking tent. (This tent has the NAME RATER in it.)

Go inside the UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE (to the left of the tent).

--------------------- GOLDENROD CITY UNDERGROUND [028] -----------------------

You will run into ETHAN/LYRA, who will give you the FASHION CASE.

Go down the stairs and get ready for some fights! From the top of the room,
going down, you will run into:

doing. :)

Next in line is:

After him, if you go down the long hallway, you can dress your Pokemon up
in accessories and take a picture.

If you go down, you will notice the stalls on the right, these change
depending on the day of the week, check LOCATIONS for more details.

Going to the south side now; two more trainers, the first (from the top) is:

POKE MANIAC ISSAC (768P)

 -LICKITUNG LV 12 (M) 324 EXP
  -Type: Normal

much we can do with it yet.

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [029] ----------------------------

Now, heal up at the Pokemon Center, and head to the north side of the town
(past the bridge, where you went to the UNDERGROUND), this time, go right,
and there is the GYM, get ready!

------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY GYM [030] ---------------------------

Talk to the man to get tips. He suggests fighting Pokemon. That would be a
good idea. Rock may be useful too. But it's your choice.

Anyway go forward and up the stairs onto the blue tiled floor, and go up and
fight:

BEAUTY VICTORIA (896P)

 -SENTRET LV 9 (F) 109 EXP

Backtrack to the stairway, and this time go around the north side and come
in to the center.

You can either battle the trainer close to you by surprise or just fight the
trainer farther than you.

I will assume you did not surprise the trainer, so if you walk to the one
farther away:

LASS CARRIE (272P)

You can go heal up at the Pokemon Center and come back if you need to, get
ready to fight WHITNEY!

if you have to hack the HP away. She has two of them!

CATHY, and after talking to her, go back and talk to WHITNEY.

You will now receive the PLAIN BADGE and TM45 ATTRACT.

Congrats on getting your third badge! Now, leave the GYM!

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [031] ----------------------------

But for now, go down from the Bug Catcher, and take the first left, then wind
around the tree, and grab the PARYLZ HEAL. Now get back in the grass, and keep
going south until you reach the bottom, where you can only go left.

Keep going left, and you will run into:

BIRD KEEPER BRYAN (448P)

 -PIDGEY LV 12 (M) 141 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Gust [Flying/Physical]

 -PIDGEOTTO LV 14 (M) 339 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

Go right from him, and grab TM66 PAYBACK. Now backtrack to the grass, hop
the ledge onto the road, and get back to where the Policeman was, and the
entrance to NATIONAL PARK.

Go upward through the entrance, that will take you to NATIONAL PARK. However,
the POKEATHLON DOME is to the left side if you want to visit it. As it is
not really a required area, I will not cover it in the main WALKTHROUGH, but
you can check the LOCATIONS or SIDEQUESTS for more details.

Also, if you want, you can participate in the BUG CATCHING game, which takes
place on certain days. For more information on that, check the SIDEQUESTS
section, or LOCATIONS.

Anyway, head through that door.

----------------------------- NATIONAL PARK [033] ----------------------------

When you enter, go to the right and talk to the lady next to the PERSIAN, she
will give you the QUICK CLAW.

Now go up, if you talk to the lady here, she will mention the trainers in the
grass. So, you don't have to worry about fighting anyone on the road, just
the lurking trainers in the grass.

So first we'll get the items we can. Follow the road up. When it splits, go
right, then keep going up until you come across the tired boy who talks about
the Pokewalker. You will notice an opening in the fance, go through that and
then down the right side, you will obtain the SOOTHE BELL!

Go back to the boy, and now go left. Keep going left and straight down. You
will notice an item hidden behind the trees, grab TM28 DIG. 

Now head back to the boy. Now I will make you battle the trainers, from the
bottom of the park, though. So go back down the road to where the road first
split off.

Now, from here, go up and you will fight:

POKEFAN BEVERLY (1024P) PokeGear

 -SNUBBULL LV 16 (F) 216 EXP
  -Type: Normal

Go up to the center of the park, then go to the right in the bottom grass
and you will fight:

SCHOOL KID JACK (300P) PokeGear

 -ODDISH LV 12 (M) 199 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Sweet Scent [Grass/Status]

 -VOLTORB LV 15 (X) 330 EXP
  -Type: Electric

Go back to the center, and to the top of the fountain, and go straight north
to fight:

POKEFAN WILLIAM (1024P) PokeGear

 -RAICHU LV 16 (M) 417 EXP
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]
   Thunderbolt [Electric/Special]

Lastly, from him, head left and you will run into:

LASS KRISE (272P) PokeGear

 -ODDISH LV 14 (F) 234 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Absorb [Grass/Special]

 -CUBONE LV 17 (F) 316 EXP
  -Type: Ground

And we are done here! So head to the right and exit out into ROUTE 036.

------------------------------- ROUTE 36 [034] -------------------------------

Go right and grab the BLU APRICORN, then go down and fight:

PSYCHIC MARK (512P)

 -ABRA LV 14 (M) 225 EXP
  -Type: Psychic

 -KADABRA LV 16 (M) 496 EXP
  -Type: Psychic

 -ABRA LV 14 (M) 225 EXP
  -Type: Psychic

Now follow the road. The path to the left goes to the cuttable tree I
mentioned earlier; leading to ROUTE 035. But we need to go right, so do so.

You will run into:

SCHOOL KID ALAN (340P) PokeGear

 -TANGELA LV 17 (M) 604 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Growth [Grass/Status]
   Absorb [Grass/Special]

Now keep going right, and talk to the person facing the odd tree. You get a
hint of what to do, so examine the odd tree, and say "Yes" and get ready for
a battle!

It's a SUDOWOODO! The only one you can get for now, so you should be sure to
capture it!

You will receive the BERRY POTS after capturing/defeating SUDOWOODO. You will
then receive ORAN BERRIES, and PECHA BERRIES. The lady will then leave.

Go east of here, and obtain HM06 ROCK SMASH by talking to the man if you have
not already! You should also go to VIOLET CITY (east) to heal up if you need
to, then go back to where you found SUDWOODO.

Now, head to the north path and into ROUTE 037!

------------------------------- ROUTE 37 [035] -------------------------------

When you reach a fork (with grass to the right and the road on the left); go
ahead and go into the grass and then go north. You will run into:

PSYCHIC GREG (544P)

 -DROWZEE LV 17 (M) 368 EXP
  -Type: Psychic
  -Moves:
   Hypnosis [Psychic/Status]
   Dream Eater [Psychic/Special]
   Disable [Normal/Status]

Keep going north, and you will find three APRICORN TREES! They are RED, BLK,
and BLU APRICORNS. Also, if it's Sunday, you will meet SUNNY here, who will
give you a MAGNET.

Go back to the crossroads, and go up the road and you will run into twins:

TWINS TORI & TIL (512P) <Double Battle>

 -MARILL LV 16 (F) 198 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -MAREEP LV 16 (F) 200 EXP
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

When you go north of them, you will notice two trainers facing the same way
inward. This means it's another double  battle:

BEAUTY CALLIE (1792P) <Double Battle with BEAUTY KASSANDRA>

 -CLEFABLE LV 16 (F) 440 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Doubleslap [Normal/Physical]
   Encore [Normal/Status]

 -WIGGLYTUFF LV 16 (F) 372 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:

  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   DoubleSlap [Normal/Physical]
   Encore [Normal/Status]
   Metronome [Normal/Status]

Now, after that, head north over the grass. The path to the right leads to
a ledge that leads back to those APRICORN we picked up earlier, so don't
worry about that. Head north into ECRUTEAK CITY!

------------------------------ ECRUTEAK CITY [036] ---------------------------

First things first, go to the Pokemon Center and heal up. You will meet BILL
here. Anyway, heal up and head out.

I would actually advise you head east into Route 042, while it is a big
detour, just go there, and head toward the MT. MORTAR cave entrance, and a
little scene will happen, but you will receive HM04 STRENGTH. While this
is not a requirement, it will be convenient to have with you. Go back to
ECRUTEAK CITY.

Back in the city, go to the house to the left of the Pokemon Center, and talk
to the man inside to get the DOWSING MCHN. You can now find hidden items!

After that, head to the DANCE THEATER, it's located on the right, the big
building. You can read the sign if you are lost.

There will be a little scene, being the hero, go up there and talk some sense
into that ROCKET GRUNT.

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (480P)

 -KOFFING LV 12 (M) 292 EXP
  -Type: Poison

After that, while you're leaving you will receive HM04 SURF. This is a good
one, and you will need it in the next chapter anyway!

Now head back outside, heal up, and go to the BURNED TOWER. It is in the top
left of the city.

------------------------------ BURNED TOWER [037] ----------------------------

1F:

Upon entering, go right and you will meet EUSINE, and the GYM LEADER MORTY.

Go up from here, and, well, it's him again! Third time now!

  -Moves:

   PoisonPowder [Poison/Status]

He's a bit of a soar loser, huh? Anyway, go up and pass the ladder he was
standing next to in order to fight:

FIREBREATHER NED (512P)

 -KOFFING LV 16 (M) 390 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:

  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:

 -GROWLITHE LV 17 (M) 331 EXP
  -Type: Fire

Then go and grab the ANTIDOTE to the left. 

Now go down the ladder where the RIVAL was standing.

B1F:

Go left to make all three LEGENDARY POKEMON run away. EUSINE will talk to you
a bit, and then rush off, just like the dogs.

Well, we're done here, go back to ECRUTEAK CITY. By the way, now that they
are on the run, you can check your POKEGEAR to see two out of three of their
locations! You can technically catch ENTEI and RAIKOU if you bother to
chase them down! Check SIDEQUESTS for more details on this.

Head back to the entrance and into ECRUTEAK CITY.

----------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY [038] ----------------------------

Back here, heal up at the Pokemon Center, and enter the GYM! Time to get the
FOURTH BADGE!

--------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY GYM [039] --------------------------

First off, talk to the man. He will give you tips, that physical moves do
not hurt ghosts. Well, if you have FORESIGHT, that's not a problem, but
anyway, bring a PSYCHIC Pokemon, which is what they are all weak against. You
can also bring a DARK Pokemon, it's your choice. I won with neither, so it
should not be too bad.

Anyway, be careful not to fall off the path, as you will begin at the starting
of the GYM. You can see the trainers you fight are lit up, but their lights
go out when defeated. (However, if you win, exit the GYM, and come back in,
their lights are on without having to fight them again.)

Anyway, go up and fight the first trainer:

MEDIUM GEORGINA (768P)

 -GASTLY LV 16 (F) 325 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Curse [???/Status]

 -GASTLY LV 16 (F) 325 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Curse [???/Status]
   Mean Look [Normal/Status]

Take one step up from her, then go right until you are in line with the next
trainer, and go north straight. You will battle her, but at least you didn't
fall off!

MEDIUM GRACE (960P)

 -HAUNTER LV 20 (F) 540 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Confuse Ray [Ghost/Status]

  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Confuse Ray [Ghost/Status]

The hint she says is pretty much how you proceed. Go one step right, one step
up, and then straight left to the next trainer:

MEDIUM EDITH (1056P)

 -HAUNTER LV 22 (F) 594 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Sucker Punch [Dark/Physical]

Go down one space, left two spaces, up one space, then go left until in line
with the next trainer, and go straight up to them. Take note of the L-shaped
path one square down and to the right of you:

MEDIUM MARTHA (960P)

 -GASTLY LV 18 (F) 366 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Mean Look [Normal/Status]

 -HAUNTER LV 20 (F) 540 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:

   Night Shade [Ghost/Special]

 -GASTLY LV 20 (F) 406 EXP
  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Curse [???/Status]

Take one step down, two right, three up, three left, then just go straight up,
and you will be face-to-face with the GYM LEADER! I advise you heal your
Pokemon at the Pokemon Center and then come back here, however.

Talk to him to begin! He has two HYPER POTIONS, so be wary!

LEADER MORTY (2760P)

 -GASTLY LV 21 (M) 427 EXP

  -Type: Ghost/Poison
  -Moves:
   Hypnosis [Psychic/Status]
   Shadow Ball [Ghost/Special]
   Mean Look [Normal/Status]
   Sucker Punch [Dark/Physical]

After you beat him, you will receive the FOG BADGE and TM30 SHADOW BALL (that
annoying move GENGAR kept using...)

When you talk to him again, he says to head west and south to OLIVINE! And
that's exactly what we are going to do.

To get out of here quickly, just step into the fog. Then exit the building.

----------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY [040] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center and make preparations. When you are set to go,
head west and out of ECRUTEAK CITY into ROUTE 038!

****************************** FIFTH BADGE [CH6] *****************************

This chapter covers everything from the FOG BADGE to acquiring the FIFTH
BADGE at CIANWOOD CITY GYM.

------------------------------- ROUTE 38 [041] -------------------------------

First, follow the road, and take the first path down and get the MAX POTION.

Now backtrack to the middle of the road, and follow it to the left, and you
will run into:

Now go back to the entrance to the Route you came from, and this time take
the north path with the grass.

You will run into:

 -MR. MIME LV 20 (M) 582 EXP
  -Type: Psychic
  -Moves:

   DoubleSlap [Normal/Physical]

Now follow the road down and left, you will end up in ROUTE 039! There is an
item there, but it will be out of reach for a very, very long time.

------------------------------- ROUTE 39 [042] -------------------------------

Go left a bit, and a little scene will begin with BAOBA. Register him in the
POKEGEAR if you want to know when the SAFARI ZONE in CIANWOOD is open! Go
ahead and choose, and then he will leave.

Now, go left and you will see the MOOMOO FARM. There is a mini-sidequest that
takes place here, that is, feeding the MILTANK seven ORAN BERRIES. You can
easily do this using the BERRY POTS. See the SIDEQUESTS section for more
details. Grab the GRN APRICORN next to the farmhouse, and then go south
into the large open field, and keep going south until you reach the cliff
edge, then go left, and you will see an item hidden next to the silo on the
left side. Grab it, it's TM60 DRAIN PUNCH.

Now go back to the road where you met BAOBA, and go south. You will first
encounter:

After her, just follow the road and you've reached OLIVINE CITY!

------------------------------ OLIVINE CITY [043] ----------------------------

While heading to the Pokemon Center, you will get cut off by your RIVAL. He
won't battle you, so don't worry about it.

Enter the first house you come to on the road, and talk to the man inside
and say "Yes" to receive a GOOD ROD.

Continue to the Pokemon Center, and heal up your Pokemon. If you want a
battle, talk to the woman on the right side of the counter! Say "Yes" if want

Go right and up, to two lone houses on a hill. The one on the right has a girl
that will give you SEALS if you acquired the SEAL CASE on the MOOMOO FARM
sidequest (see SIDEQUEST section for more details.)

The house on the left has a POKEMON TRADE if you're interested. You can get
VOLTORB.

Go left and up the thin path ane examine the rock to get a FULL HEAL.

Now, go to the bottom right side of the city, where the tall structure is.
This is the LIGHTHOUSE (called GLITTER LIGHTHOUSE, but I refer to it as
OLIVINE LIGHTHOUSE). Enter it.

-------------------------- OLIVINE LIGHTHOUSE [052] --------------------------

Inside, go all the way up, and you will see an elevator and a stairway. We are
actually taking the stairway, so climb up to the second floor.

You will notice this floor is split up in two areas. Battle the trainer close

 -GROWLITHE LV 18 (M) 351 EXP

LASS CONNIE (336P)

 -MARILL LV 21 (F) 261 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Rollout [Rock/Physical]

Now, what you do is instead of going back down the ladder, walk out of the
window on the right!

OUTSIDE:

Run to the left side of the entrance to grab the RARE CANDY, then go into
the opening.

3F:

You're back on the third floor! Only now on the other side. Now battle the
sailor to the right if you want:

SAILOR KENT (640P)

 -KRABBY LV 18 (M) 442 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Harden [Normal/Status]
   Leer [Normal/Status]

 -KRABBY LV 20 (M) 492 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:

Grab the ETHER to the right after you beat him, then go left toward the next
ladder, and fight:

BIRD KEEPER DENIS (576P)

 -SPEAROW LV 18 (M) 223 EXP

 -SPEAROW LV 18 (M) 223 EXP

4F:

Go up the next ladder.

5F:

Up here, there are two sailors. Fight the first one:

SAILOR TERRELL (640P)

 -POLIWHIRL LV 20 (M) 561 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:

Now go around and fight the second one if you want to:

 -MACHOP LV 18 (M) 288 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]
   Karate Chop [Fighting/Physical]

   Karate Chop [Fighting/Physical]

 -POLIWHIRL LV 18 (M) 504 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:

Then go up and grab the SUPER REPEL. Now, climb the ladder.

6F:

Up here, talk to JASMINE. She will ask you to get some medicine from CIANWOOD.
So, let's do that. Go through the door she just opened, go right and get the
SUPER POTION.

Now go to the elevator, and it will take you back to the first floor.

1F:

Now exit back into OLIVINE CITY.

------------------------------ OLIVINE CITY [045] ----------------------------

Go to the Pokemon Center and heal up. We will now be crossing the sea, so make
necessary preparations. You will need a Pokemon that can learn/knows the move
SURF.

I would say bring REPELS, as TENTACOOL can get annoying to run into too much,
as I will be making you fight every Trainer along the way!

Once done, head left out of the city.

------------------------------- ROUTE 40 [046] -------------------------------

You will now be on a beach. Note the BATTLE FRONTIER to the left. It cannot
be accessed right now, however.

Go to where the beach juts out into sea the most, and begin surfing! You
should be able to see a swimmer, so battle him!:

SWIMMER SIMON (320P)

 -TENTACOOL LV 20 (M) 450 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   BubbleBeam [Water/Special]

 -TENTACOOL LV 20 (M) 450 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Toxic Spikes [Poison/Status]

Swim on a straight path downward, and you should spot:

SWIMMER ELAINE (336P)

 -STARYU LV 21 (X) 477 EXP
  -Type: Water

Swim to an island on the right to find TM88 PLUCK. Then jump back in the water
and head left, then down.

You should run into:

SWIMMER RANDALL (288P)

 -SHELLDER LV 18 (M) 373 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Withdraw [Water/Status]

 -WARTORTLE LV 20 (M) 612 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

 -SHELLDER LV 18 (M) 373 EXP
  -Type: Water

There should be a trainer swimming left to right (back and forth) below him.
Battle her:

SWIMMER PAULA (304P)

 -STARYU LV 19 (X) 430 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -SHELLDER LV 19 (F) 394 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]
   Protect [Normal/Status]

Now, keep surfing downward and you should enter ROUTE 041!

------------------------------- ROUTE 41 [047] -------------------------------

You may want to keep this place in mind, as it contains the WHIRL ISLANDS.

Anyway, I'm going to make you fight every trainer, but if you want to reach
CIANWOOD CITY with ease, surf to the left and you will reach the shore line.

But I suggest you first surf right, and get ready for some battles!

So, surfing right, you will first run into:

SWIMMER CHARLIE (304P)

 -SHELLDER LV 21 (M) 436 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Leer [Normal/Status]

 -TENTACOOL LV 19 (M) 427 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Acid [Poison/Physical]

 -TENTACRUEL LV 19 (M) 834 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   BubbleBeam [Water/Special]
   Toxic Spikes [Poison/Status]

From him, sailing downward, you should just pass a WHIRLPOOL and run into
a trainer. Battle her:


SWIMMER KAYLEE (320P)

 -GOLDEEN LV 18 (F) 427 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -GOLDEEN LV 20 (F) 475 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -SEAKING LV 20 (F) 727 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Water Pulse [Water/Special]

From her, go to the left and fight:

SWIMMER MATTHEW (368P)

 -KRABBY LV 23 (M) 565 EXP
  -Type: Water

Now go back to the right side, and then sail down along the right side. Keep
going, and eventually the path will turn left. Keep following the path left.
The first chance you get, take the path that goes up. You will run into
some trainers.

The first is:

SWIMMER KARA (320P)

 -STARYU LV 20 (X) 453 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -STARMIE LV 20 (X) 886 EXP
  -Type: Water/Psychic
  -Moves:
   Swift [Normal/Special]
   Rapid Spin [Normal/Physical]

Go north of her, and there is one trainer in place looking around. Battle him:

SWIMMER BERKE (368P)

 -QWILFISH LV 23 (M) 492 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison

There is one more trainer to the north, fight her:

SWIMMER WENDY (336P)

 -HORSEA LV 21 (F) 373 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -HORSEA LV 21 (F) 373 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]
   BubbleBeam [Water/Special]

Now go back down to the bottom path, and surf left this time, where there is
a trainer swimming around. Battle him:

SWIMMER RONALD (320P)

 -GYARADOS LV 20 (M) 916 EXP
  -Type: Water/Flying

 -GYARADOS LV 20 (M) 916 EXP
  -Type: Water/Flying
  -Moves:
   Bite {Dark/Physical]

Go left from him to reach another trainer:

SWIMMER DENISE (352P)

 -SEEL LV 22 (F) 471 EXP
  -Type: Water

Now surf west, until you hit land! This is CIANWOOD CITY. However, there are
two trainers we have not fought yet, you can heal at the Pokemon Center if you
want, but surf north and then right to fight two more; if you went left like
I said you may want to earlier (to avoid all the other trainers), you would
have already fought these two in the reverse order:

SWIMMER SUSIE (352P)

 -PSYDUCK LV 20 (F) 342 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -GOLDEEN LV 22 (F) 522 EXP
  -Type: Water

And next to her (on the right) is a trainer swimming around; fight him!

SWIMMER GEORGE (304P)

 -TENTACOOL LV 16 (M) 360 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Acid [Poison/Physical]

 -TENTACOOL LV 16 (M) 360 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Acid [Poison/Physical]

 -TENTACOOL LV 17 (M) 382 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]

 -TENTACOOL LV 17 (M) 382 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison

 -REMORAID LV 19 (M) 316 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -STARYU LV 19 (X) 430 EXP
  -Type: Water

After that battle, you have fought every trainer on this Route! Now sail west
and south to CIANWOOD CITY!

------------------------------ CIANWOOD CITY [048] ---------------------------

First things first, heal at the Pokemon Center. You can get tips on the GYM
from the man standing at the counter, as he's not in the GYM.

Now, exit the Pokemon Center, and go to the building right next to it (the
PHARMACY), and talk to the man inside. He will give you the SECRETPOTION.

If you go to the house on the left of the PHARMACY, a boy will give you a
SHUCKLE to take care of. Make room in your party if you want it!

Now head north in the city. You will see CAMERON's house, take a photo if you
want. Keep going north, there is a cave to the left, this leads to the SAFARI
ZONE, through two routes. This is not part of the main story, so check the
SIDEQUESTS section on details about that!

Keep going north, and...is that SUICUNE? Try going close to it, then an event
will begin, and it will look at you and run away, again.

Then EUSINE will come, and...battle!

MYSTERY MAN EUSINE (3429P)

 -DROWZEE LV 25 (M) 543 EXP
  -Ability: Insomnia
  -Type: Psychic
  -Moves:

  -Ability: Static
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Thunder [Electric/Special]
   Screech [Normal/Status]
   SonicBoom [Normal/Special]
   Rollout [Rock/Physical]

After that, heal at the Pokemon Center, and head for the GYM!

----------------------------- CIANWOOD CITY GYM [049] ------------------------

So, we have to stop that waterfall on him. Even though we go left to do that,
let's go right first to battle the Trainers on that side.

So, go right and fight:

BLACK BELT LAO (648P)

 -HITMONCHAN LV 27 (M) 810 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Mach Punch [Fighting/Physical]

Now go to the top and fight the one pacing back and forth:

BLACK BELT LUNG (600P)

 -MANKEY LV 23 (M) 364 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Fury Swipes [Normal/Physical]

 -MANKEY LV 23 (M) 364 EXP

  -Moves:
   Screech [Normal/Status]

 -PRIMEAPE LV 25 (M) 798 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Screech [Normal/Status]

Now go back down to the entrance, and this time, go left. Fight the first
trainer you see!

BLACK BELT YOSHI (648P)

 -HITMONLEE LV 27 (M) 804 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

From him, go up and fight the next trainer:

BLACK BELT NOB (600P)

 -MACHOP LV 25 (M) 400 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

 -MACHOKE LV 25 (M) 781 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Rock Slide [Rock/Physical]

He probably covered the stairs you were supposed to use to get up there. No
problem, either go to the right side of the GYM and across the bridge, or
just exit the GYM and come back in. I advise the second option, as you can go
heal your Pokemon and get ready for the fight with the GYM LEADER!

So, heal up, come back in, climb the left set of stairs again. and examine the
large red button. That should stop the waterfall. Speak to the GYM LEADER to
begin! He has two HYPER POTIONS, so be wary!

LEADER CHUCK (3720P)

 -PRIMEAPE LV 29 (M) 950 EXP
  -Ability: Vital Spirit
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Rock Slide [Rock/Physical]
   Double Team [Normal/Status]
   Focus Punch [Fighting/Physical]
   Leer [Normal/Status]

 -POLIWRATH LV 31 (M) 1228 EXP <Holding SITRUS BERRY>
  -Ability: Water Absorb
  -Type: Water/Fighting
  -Moves:
   Surf [Water/Special]
   Hypnosis [Psychic/Status]
   Body Slam [Normal/Physicla]
   Focus Punch [Fighting/Physical]

After that, you will receive the STORM BADGE and TM01 FOCUS PUNCH. Now you can
use FLY! What is FLY? Well exit the GYM and find out!

------------------------------ CIANWOOD CITY [050] ---------------------------

Upon leaving, you will receive HM02 FLY from the lady. As she says, you can
now fly back to any city you have previously visited! It will put you at the
Pokemon Center. This makes getting the next badge a whole lot easier! Also,
you can give Shuckie (the SHUCKLE) back to it's owner if you wish.

Congrats on your FIFTH BADGE! The next chapter is very short, fly back to
OLIVINE CITY!

******************************* SIXTH BADGE [CH7] ****************************

This covers from the STORM BADGE to the SIXTH BADGE in OLIVINE CITY. This is
a short chapter!

------------------------------ OLIVINE CITY [051] ----------------------------

Once you arrive here, head for the LIGHTHOUSE.

-------------------------- OLIVINE LIGHTHOUSE [052] --------------------------

Take the elevator to quickly reach the top. Go and speak to JASMINE, and the
Pokemon will become better after you hand her the SECRETPOTION you got from
CIANWOOD CITY.

Now, get back in the elevator and head out into the city.

------------------------------ OLIVINE CITY [053] ----------------------------

You will get a call from BAOBA. The SAFARI ZONE, or the Gate to it, is now
open! Check the SIDEQUESTS section for more.

With that done, you can head to the GYM. Make all necessary preparations and
then move out!

---------------------------- OLIVINE CITY GYM [054] --------------------------

The man will just say she uses Steel-type. I advise bringing a Fighting
or Fire Pokemon with you for this one. You can also bring a water type, as
her last Pokemon is weak against it.

There are two people in the gym, but they are not trainers, so do not worry
about them. They will thank you for getting her back to the gym.

Talk to JASMINE to begin!

LEADER JASMINE (4200P)

  -Type: Electric/Steel
  -Moves:

  -Type: Steel/Ground
  -Moves:
   Screech [Normal/Status]
   Sandstorm [Rock/Status]
   Iron Tail [Steel/Physical]

You will then receive the MINERAL BADGE and TM23 IRON TAIL. Now exit the GYM
and back into the city.

------------------------------ OLIVINE CITY [055] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center, and congrats on your SIXTH BADGE! Just two more
to go. This was a short chapter, huh?

FLY to ECRUTEAK CITY.

***************************** SEVENTH BADGE [CH8] ****************************

This covers from the MINERAL BADGE to the SEVENTH BADGE. It includes the
ROCKET HIDEOUT and LAKE OF RAGE events.

----------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY [056] ----------------------------

You will need a Pokemon that knows SURF, and another that knows CUT. Once you
have them, head out the east exit, it will take you to ROUTE 42.

------------------------------- ROUTE 42 [057] -------------------------------

If you did not come here before, then head to the cave entrance near you,
where a Hiker will bump into you, and give you HM04 STRENGTH.

If you have done that before, then go north and pick up the item, it is TM55
SHADOW CLAW.

As far as we're concerned, we do not have to enter the cave. You can if you
want, check the SIDEQUESTS section for details on exploring MT. MORTAR.

To get to where we want to go, start surfing on the body of water on the right
side. You will reach land not before too long, and will notice three APRICORN
TREES, and more noticeable, SUICUNE.

CUT the tree, and head down, for a brief scene where SUICUNE escapes and
EUSINE appears yet again, talks a bit, and leaves.

Head down and collect the three APRICORNS (PNK, GRN, and YLW). Now head back
up, and to the right, ignoring the cave entrance, and to another body of
water on the right side. Pick up the item next to the water, it is a SUPER
POTION.

There is a Fisherman facing downward at the shoreline, battle him!

FISHERMAN TULLY (608P) PokeGear

 -QWILFISH LV 19 (M) 406 EXP
  -Type: Water/Poison
  -Moves:
   Minimize [Normal/Status]

After him, head right, ignoring the cave entrance, and fight the Trainer next
to the cave:

POKE MANIAC SHANE (1088P)

 -NIDORINA LV 17 (F) 426 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

 -NIDORINO LV 17 (M) 429 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

Right next to him, there is a Hiker, battle him too:

HIKER BENJAMIN (544P)

 -DIGLETT LV 15 (M) 259 EXP
  -Type: Ground

 -DUGTRIO LV 17 (M) 556 EXP
  -Type: Ground
  -Moves:
   Growl [Normal/Status]

 -GEODUDE LV 15 (M) 234 EXP
  -Type: Rock

And keep heading east, and you will reach MAHOGANY TOWN!

----------------------------- MAHOGANY TOWN [058] ----------------------------

We can't really do much at the moment. So heal up at the Pokemon Center, and
head up through the north exit of the town, into ROUTE 43. You will need a
Pokemon that knows SURF.

------------------------------- ROUTE 43 [059] -------------------------------

Once here, head north and face the first Trainer you see:

CAMPER SPENCER (320P)

  -SANDSHREW LV 18 (M) 358 EXP
   -Type: Ground
   -Moves:
    Sand-Attack [Ground/Status]
    Rapid Spin [Normal/Physical]
    Swift [Normal/Special]

  -SANDSLASH LV 18 (M) 628 EXP
   -Type: Ground

  -ZUBAT LV 20 (M) 231 EXP
   -Type: Poison/Flying

From here, rather than following the road into the gate, go through the
patches of grass on the left side. The reason is that the gatehouse will
charge you money for passing. So, we may as well save money and gain
experience from the Trainers along the way.

So, heading north through the patch of grass, you will run into:

PICNICKER TIFFANY (336P) PokeGear

 -CLEFAIRY LV 21 (F) 306 EXP
  -Type: Normal

From her, if you have a Pokemon that knows CUT, then SURF left across the 
small body of water. CUT the tree, and get the BLK APRICORN. Now SURF back
to the Trainer you just fought, and continue north through more grass, you
will run into:

POKE MANIAC BRENT (1536P) PokeGear

 -NIDORINA LV 20 (F) 501 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Tail Whip [Normal/Status]

 -NIDORINO LV 24 (M) 606 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Horn Attack [Normal/Physical]

After him, instead of continuing north, go down through the grass on the
right side (you came up from the left path.) Head down to the ledges next to
the gatehouse, and pick up the MAX ETHER.

Now go right and follow the yellow road to the north. Keep going, and you
will run into:

POKE MANIAC BECKETT (1280P)

 -SLOWBRO LV 20 (M) 702 EXP
  -Type: Water/Psychic
  -Moves:
   Growl [Normal/Status]

From him, you can see another Trainer to the top left, standing in another
fork. So, battle him!

POKE MANIAC RON (1280P)

 -NIDOKING LV 20 (M) 835 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Ground
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

Before we head up through the north exit, take a quick detour to the left
of this Trainer, down the patches of grass. You will see a Trainer to the left
of the grass, between two bodies of water, battle him!

FISHERMAN MARVIN (480P)

 -MAGIKARP LV 10 (M) 42 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -GYARADOS LV 20 (M) 914 EXP
  -Type: Water/Flying
  -Moves:
   Surf [Water/Special]
   Thrash [Normal/Physical]

 -MAGIKARP LV 15 (M) 63 EXP
  -Type: Water

After him, backtrack to Poke Maniac Ron, then head up through the north exit
into the LAKE OF RAGE.

------------------------------ LAKE OF RAGE [060] ----------------------------

If you need to, FLY back to MAHOGANY TOWN, heal up, and then FLY back to
this location. It is a flyable area.

Now, head up to the shoreline where the old man is standing, you will see
a Pokemon out in the water. SURF, and get ready for a battle!

RED GYARADOS LV 30
 -Type: Water/Flying
 -Ability: Intimidate
 -Moves:
  Bite [Dark/Physical]
  Dragon Rage [Dragon/Special]
  Leer [Normal/Status]
  Twister [Dragon/Special]

I would advise capturing the above. It is a guaranteed SHINY POKEMON, as well
as being a GYARADOS, a very useful Pokemon. Anyway, either defeat it or
capture it.

Either way, you will obtain the RED SCALE. You can exchange this with MR.
POKEMON (remember him?) to get the EXP. SHARE, which is a very useful item!

Heading back to the shoreline, you will see a Trainer with a DRAGONITE next
to him. Don't speak to him yet! Instead, we will fight two Trainers first.
But, if you want to skip Trainer battles, or did them already, then just
speak to him, and ignore the next section with Trainers.

However, if you want to fight the Trainers, then head right of the old man,
and talk to the Fisherman:

FISHERMAN ANDRE (864P)

 -GYARADOS LV 27 (M) 1237 EXP
  -Type: Water/Flying

From him, head right and up to another Fisherman:

FISHERMAN RAYMOND (704P)

 -MAGIKARP LV 22 (M) 93 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

 -MAGIKARP LV 22 (M) 93 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

 -MAGIKARP LV 22 (M) 93 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]

 -MAGIKARP LV 22 (M) 93 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Splash [Water/Status]
   Tackle [Normal/Physical]

Now, stick to the right path, and go all the way up. You will see a Trainer
facing out to the lake, talk to her:

ACE TRAINER LOIS (1500P)

 -MAREEP LV 25 (F) 315 EXP
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Thunderwave [Electric/Status]
   Thundershock [Electric/Special]

 -NINETALES LV 25 (F) 952 EXP
  -Type: Fire
  -Moves:
   Nasty Plot [Dark/Status]
   Confuse Ray [Ghost/Status]
   Flamethrower [Fire/Special]

After her, head back to the Trainer and DRAGONITE, and speak to him. Agree to
help him out, and he will FLY away. You should do the same, FLY to MAHOGANY
TOWN.

----------------------------- MAHOGANY TOWN [061] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon center, and then head to the "Souvenir Shop" north of
the Pokemon GYM and Pokemon Center.

Inside, you will see a scene with LANCE. After this, head down the stairway,
and into the TEAM ROCKET HIDEOUT.

--------------------------- TEAM ROCKET HIDEOUT [062] ------------------------

B1F:

Inside, you will notice a statue of a PERSIAN in front of you. When their
eyes are glowing red, it means when you cross in front of them, you will
trigger an alarm. That's okay, though, since they shouldn't be too much of a
problem, and you get experience out of it.

You will fight these two Rocket Grunts back-to-back each time you trip an 
alarm:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (760P)

 -DROWZEE LV 17 (M) 370 EXP
  -Type: Psychic

 -ZUBAT LV 19 (M) 219 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (720P)

 -ZUBAT LV 16 (M) 184 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying
  -Moves:
   Supersonic [Normal/Status]

 -GRIMER LV 17 (M) 327 EXP
  -Type: Poison
  -Moves:
   Disable [Normal/Status]

 -RATTATA LV 18 (M) 219 EXP
  -Type: Normal

I usually go through all the statues to get as much experience as I can, but
if you want to disable them, then head left from the first statue, until you
see an opening to the south. Go into this opening, then follow right. There
should be an opening before the statue, go down.

Now head left, once again going down and following the winding path. You
will run into:

SCIENTIST GREGG (640P)

 -MAGNEMITE LV 20 (X) 381 EXP
  -Type: Electric/Steel

 -MAGNEMITE LV 20 (X) 381 EXP
  -Type: Electric/Steel

 -MAGNEMITE LV 20 (X) 381 EXP
  -Type: Electric/Steel

Behind him is a computer. If you want to deactivate the statues as not to
trigger more guards, go ahead and do so. If you decide to keep it on, then
you will face the two Rocket Grunts (listed at the first statue). It's your
choice.

Grab the item next to the PC, it's a GUARD SPEC.

Now backtrack to the entrance, then head all the way left to fight:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (640P)

 -RATTATA LV 16 (M) 195 EXP
  -Type: Normal

 -RATTATA LV 16 (M) 195 EXP
  -Type: Normal

 -RATTATA LV 16 (M) 195 EXP
  -Type: Normal

 -RATTATA LV 16 (M) 195 EXP
  -Type: Normal

If you want, you could go down to a rigged checkerboard floor, where you face
Pokemon on certain spaces. If you do not want to go through this, however, 
read the paragraph below the Floor Traps info below.

Here is a useful chart for the Floor Traps I made; explaining it better than
I can with words:

http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/960099-pokemon-heartgold/faqs/59998

Details regarding the above:

On Electric Squares: (The ones that zap)

VOLTORB LV 23 (X) 338 EXP
 -Type: Electric
 -Moves:
  Screech [Normal/Status]
  Spark [Electric/Physical]
  Light Screen [Psychic/Status]

On Rock Squares: (The ones that show rocky crumble)

GEODUDE LV 21 (M/F) 219 EXP
 -Type: Rock/Ground

On Poison Gas Squares: (The ones with purple gas)

KOFFING LV 21 (M/F) 342 EXP
 -Type: Poison
 -Moves:
  Smog [Poison/Special]

To skip the floor traps:

Head back to the winding way where you went to deactivate the statues and/or 
fight the Scientist. But only stay in the first hallway, and cross the statue
that has an item on the other side. If you did not deactivate the statues,
you will fight the same two Rocket Grunts here.

Pick up the HYPER POTION. Now head downward, until it forces you to turn left,
where there is another statue. Keep heading left, and pick up the NUGGET, and
then continue, until you reach a teleporter and stairway beyond another (last)
Pokemon statue.

There is a teleporter that will take you to the entrance if you need to heal
up. This isn't needed, as LANCE will heal you on the next floor.

So, head down the stairs.

B2F:

In a brief scene, LANCE will heal your Pokemon. Now head right, and keep that
locked door in mind. Fight the first Rocket Grunt you see:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (720P)

 -VENONAT LV 18 (M) 288 EXP
  -Type: Bug/Poison

 -VENONAT LV 18 (M) 288 EXP
  -Type: Bug/Poison

From him, head downward, right, and to a stairway. Battle the nearby Grunt:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (720P)

 -GOLBAT LV 18 (M) 658 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

Now go down the stairs.

B3F:

Another scene with LANCE.

Now, head all the way to the left, ignoring the entrance into a room next to
the defeated Grunt. Go left into a room with a Rocket Grunt and a Scientist,
fight the Scientist first:

SCIENTIST MITCH (768P)

 -DITTO LV 24 (X) 313 EXP
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Transform [Normal/Status]

From him, go under the Grunt nearby, and get the two items. They are a PROTEIN
and an X SPECIAL (left and right respectively.) Now, battle the Grunt:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (760P)

 -RATICATE LV 19 (M) 421 EXP
  -Type: Normal

Now you know one of two passwords. You don't actually have to memorize it, so
don't worry.

Now head back right to the defeated Grunt, and go up into the room with the
PCs, a Grunt, and a Scientist. Battle the Scientist:

SCIENTIST ROSS (704P)

 -KOFFING LV 22 (M) 537 EXP
  -Type: Poison

 -KOFFING LV 22 (M) 537 EXP
  -Type: Poison

Now head up and fight the Grunt:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (720P)

 -EKANS LV 18 (F) 238 EXP
  -Type: Poison

 -GLOOM LV 18 (F) 508 EXP
  -Type: Grass/Poison

Now you know both passwords for the Boss's room. Let's head there. First,
exit the room south, and go right, then up, get the FULL HEAL, then head up
and left to get TM49 SNATCH. Now head to the stairway in the top right, 
going back to B2F.

B2F:

Head straight left, and fight:

TEAM ROCKET GRUNT (680P)

 -RATTATA LV 17 (M) 207 EXP
  -Type: Normal

 -ZUBAT LV 17 (M) 196 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Flying

 -RATTATA LV 17 (M) 207 EXP
  -Type: Normal

Now head down the stairs next to him.

B3F:

Go down and take the next stairway up.

B2F:

Pick up the only item in this room: TM46 THIEF. Now head back down the
stairway.

B3F:

Go to the door in the bottom right, and your RIVAL will interrupt you. There
is no battle, so don't worry.

After him, get the ULTRA BALL on the right, then examine the door.

You will then face:

EXECUTIVE PETREL (880P)

 -ZUBAT LV 22 (M) 253 EXP
  -Ability: Inner Focus
  -Type: Poison/Flying
  -Moves:

  -Ability: ????
  -Type: Normal
  -Moves:
   Hyper Fang [Normal/Physical]
   Sucker Punch [Dark/Physical]
   Scary Face [Normal/Status]
   Crunch [Dark/Physical]

After he runs away, his MURKROW follows. Let's get that bird! Go back to the
stairway in the top left.

B2F:

Go right a bit, and the bird will run off again. Follow it down the path, to
the stairway at the end, go down.

B3F:

Talk to the bird, then follow it down, then go up the bottom right stairway.

B2F:

Now, face it one last time, and it will run to the locked door. Follow it to
the locked door, and it will get it to open. But as you enter the room, you
will be interuppted. You will now fight a double battle, with LANCE as your
partner. LANCE is as follows:

PKMN TRAINER LANCE (Partner)

 -DRAGONITE LV 40 (M)
  -Ability: Inner Focus
  -Type: Dragon/Flying
  -Moves:
   Fly [Flying/Physical]
   Twister [Dragon/Special]
   Thunder [Electric/Special]

The DOUBLE BATTLE is with a ROCKET GRUNT and ARIANA. Her Pokemon are listed
first, his are listed second. However, they appear in pairs:

  -Moves:

   Sludge [Poison/Special]

After this battle, all the Team Rocket memebers will leave. Now to shut off
the power, and to do this we have to take out the three ELECTRODE on the left
side.

So, let's do that. Approach the first one and start a battle. Do the same for
all three of them. You can faint or capture all three if you wish.

All three have the following stats:

ELECTRODE LV 23 (X) 492 EXP
 -Type: Electric
 -Moves:
  Spark [Electric/Physical]
  Rollout [Rock/Physical]
  Screech [Normal/Status]

After this, LANCE will give you HM05 WHIRLPOOL. After he leaves, go back up
the stairway to the left.

B1F:

Take the teleporter to the entrance, and then leave. Now that you cleared this
area, you can go give a RED SCALE to MR. POKEMON to get the EXP. SHARE if you
have not already. You can also go to the LAKE OF RAGE on WEDNESDAY to fully
explore it, as the Lake water recedes on those days. The "Souvenir Shop"
becomes a normal shop now, as well.

Otherwise, get ready for the SEVENTH BADGE!

----------------------------- MAHOGANY TOWN [063] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon center, and bring some Anti-ice Pokemon with you.
Fighting or Fire both work. I advise the Electric-type as well, as there are
many that are both ice/water or just water with ice moves.

Head into the gym!

--------------------------- MAHOGANY TOWN GYM [064] --------------------------

A few ice puzzles to do. You can either view the gameFAQs "Mahogany Town Gym
Ice Solutions" image another user uploaded, or you can try to follow along
with my steps.

So, in the first room, make sure you're standing next to the man who gives you
tips, and go up. Now, slide left, then up, then right, then up again.

Next room, go fight the Trainer on the left:

SKIER DIANA (928P)

 -JYNX LV 29 (F) 850 EXP
  -Type: Psychic/Ice
  -Moves:
   Mean Look [Normal/Status]

And then the Trainer on the right:

BOARDER PATTON (864P)

 -SWINUB LV 27 (M) 450 EXP
  -Type: Ice/Ground

 -SWINUB LV 27 (M) 450 EXP
  -Type: Ice/Ground

Now, go back to the Trainer on the left, and stand on the upper left most
square, so you are in line with one of the two blocks on the ice. Now slide
right into the block, causing it to push and collide with the one on the
right side. Now slide right so you are up against the block again. Now go up.

Enter the next room.

We're going to clear the room of Trainers before doing the Ice Puzzle, so go
battle the Trainer to your left:

BOARDER DEANDRE (800P)

 -SEEL LV 25 (M) 535 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Ice Shard [Ice/Physical]
   Encore [Normal/Status]

Go behind him, slide right, then up, and battle:

SKIER JILL (928P)

 -DEWGONG LV 29 (F) 1093 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice
  -Moves:

From her, slide right, down, left, up, right, up, right, then up, to fight:

BOARDER GERARDO (800P)

 -SHELLDER LV 25 (M) 519 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -CLOYSTER LV 26 (M) 1131 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice
  -Moves:
   Toxic Spikes [Poison/Status]
   Aurora Beam [Ice/Special]

From him, go down, left, down, left, down, to reach the entrance to the room
again. Go through the door and come back to reset the Ice Puzzle to the room.

I also recommend healing up at the Pokemon Center and following the steps to
come back here.

Anyway, to reach the Gym leader from the entrance of the third room:

From the entrance, take one step to the right, then up, so you are facing one
of the blocks. Slide up and push the block forward. Now go straight back, and
then take one step left, and then up, left, down, right, right, and then up.

You should now be facing the Gym leader, battle him!

You will get the GLACIER BADGE and TM07 HAIL. Congrats on the Seventh Badge!
Just one more to go!

Exit by going down left down, then in the next room, down, left, then the
first/final room, straight down, right, down, and out.

----------------------------- MAHOGANY TOWN [065] ----------------------------

You will get a call from PROF. ELM. He will talk about the Radio talking about
Team Rocket. Well, before we get our next Badge, we have to deal with them
first. Heal up, and FLY to GOLDENROD CITY.

***************************** EIGHTH BADGE [CH9] *****************************

This covers everything from the GLACIER BADGE to the final JOHTO BADGE. It
contains the TEAM ROCKET event regarding Goldenrod City and the Radio Tower.
The Ice Path is also in this section.

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [066] ----------------------------

Back here, you will notice there are more Team Rocket members than there used
to be. Talk to some to get an idea of what's going on. Talk to the one near
the flower shop in the north side of the city.

Now go to the underground, we're going to do something interesting...

--------------------- GOLDENROD CITY UNDERGROUND [067] -----------------------

In the underground, head to the north side (the studio), and go in front of
the Team Rocket member. It is not a battle, rather, he will give you a
Rocket Uniform!

With this, head back up into Goldenrod City. You will not be able to leave
the city for now!

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [068] ----------------------------

Before we go to the Radio Tower, make an empty space in your party and pick
up an EEVEE from BILL if you haven't already. You can also register his
phone number from the little girl. It does not matter if you are in Rocket
Uniform.

You can try talking to people to see their reactions.

When you're done, head to the Radio Tower!

------------------------------ RADIO TOWER [069] -----------------------------

1F:

Talk to the Grunt in front of the stairway, and he will move aside. But, you
will be interuppted, once again, by your Rival! However, you will not fight

it's TM82 SLEEP TALK. Now talk to the Director. You will get the CARD KEY!

When he's done talking, leave using the nearby stairway.

B1F:

Grab the item, it's the AMULET COIN! A very useful item, that will increase
your income. Keep in mind I will still give the normal rewards when presenting
Trainers.

Take the elevator back to the 1F of the Department Store, and leave.

you, and gives you a RAINBOW WING [HeartGold] or a SILVER WING [SoulSilver],
which are needed to get HO-OH and LUGIA respectively! However, we can't get

Now, leave the Radio Tower. Time to go after that final Johto Badge!

---------------------------- GOLDENROD CITY [074] ----------------------------

  -Type: Electric/Steel

Before we go out of this route, which we do by going down the right path, we
will clear up the rest of the Trainers here. If you don't want to, just skip
down to the next section.

To clear Trainers, go north from Ace Trainer Allen, you will see a Trainer
next to an item. Pick up the item, it's am ULTRA BALL. Now battle the Trainer:

POKE MANIAC ZACH (1920P)

 -RHYHORN LV 30 (M) 866 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground
  -Moves:
   Scary Face [Normal/Status]

 -PIDGEOTTO LV 28 (M) 678 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying
  -Moves:
   Twister [Dragon/Physical]

Now, head into the Cave entrance. This is the ICE PATH. There are no Trainers
inside, just some Ice Puzzles. Be sure you have a Pokemon that has STRENGTH
and one with ROCK SMASH with you.

-------------------------------- ICE PATH [077] ------------------------------

1F:

There are Wild Pokemon, several Ice Puzzles, and a Strength Puzzle. For the
Puzzles, just follow what I say step-by-step. If you mess up, leave and re-
enter the room to reset everything.

The first ice sheet in front of you is no puzzle. Simply slide your way over
to the path by going right and up, right and up.

Follow the linear path until you come to a large sheet of ice. This is the
first puzzle.

There is only one way onto the ice, so follow these movements exactly from
that location.

Up, left, up, left, down, left, up, right.

You should now be on the other side. Now go forward to another sheet of ice,
(past the stairway), and once again it only has one way in. Follow these 
steps once again:

Right, down, left, up, left, down, left, up, right.

Pick up the item, it's HM07 WATERFALL.

Now, to get back:

Left, down, left.

Now go up the stairway, and the man there will stop you as you pass him. He
will not fight, just talk a little about the HM you picked up. Now continue
to the end of the path where there is a ladder, going down.

B1F:

You have to be very particular with steps down here. I advise a repel so you
are not interuppted by wild Pokemon, but you can also just walk instead of
run to make them appear less.

Okay, for this part, I will give a step by step again. Stand below the first
boulder (the boulder positioned farthest left), and follow these instructions:

Use STRENGTH. Push the boulder UP 4 times. Leave it for now.

Next, go down to the second boulder (that was to the right of this one you
just pushed.)

Push it RIGHT 1 time, DOWN 2 times, LEFT 5 times, DOWN 1 time, RIGHT 1 time.
It should fall down.

Go down and to the far right, and there should be a lone boulder all the way
to the right of the room. Follow these steps:

Push it LEFT 1 time, DOWN 5 times, RIGHT 1 time, DOWN 3 times, UP 1 time, 
LEFT 4 times. It should fall down.

Go up from this hole, there should be another boulder.

Push it UP 2 times, RIGHT 2 times, UP 3 times, LEFT 2 times. It should fall
down.

Now go back to the first boulder we left behind. Just go left from this hole
that you dropped the boulder into.

Push it RIGHT 1 time, and DOWN 1 time. It should fall down.

Now jump down the same hole you just pushed the boulder into.

B2F:

Slide left from your position, and pick up the MAX POTION. Now slide your way
to the ladder at the top right of the room to go back to B1F.

B1F:

Back here, fall down the hole closest to you (and the ladder.)

B2F:

Now slide down, left, up, and right.

Pick up the FULL HEAL. Now go down the ladder.

B3F:

Go right, and use ROCK SMASH to get the NEVERMELTICE. Hop the ledge on the
right and get to the ladder.

B2F:

Go left and down, you will see another sheet of ice. However, don't go on it
yet. Instead, hug the wall and go up the stairs, follow the path to the
second set of stairs. So you will now be at the top right of the ice sheet.

From the wall, stand on the fourth square to the left (second from the right).

Slide down, then right. Pick up TM72 AVALANCHE. Now slide left, and up. Go
up the ladder.

B1F:

Follow the path to another sheet of ice. See the boulder? Use STRENGTH, and
push it DOWN 1 time. Now head to the right side of the ice sheet, so you are
standing one step above the bottom wall of the area (Meaning you are at the
bottom right of the ice sheet, facing left.)

Slide left, up, left, down. Pick up the IRON. Then go up, right, and up, to
get off the sheet.

Now go to the ladder, and go up.

1F:

Get the PROTEIN up the stairs. Now go down, and there is a final ice sheet.
There is also a Kimono Girl...so let's talk to her.

Standing on the right square (two squares facing the ice sheet, stand on the
second one with the obstacle in front of it), slide:

Down, left, down, right. Then face down and speak to the Kimono Girl. If you
want to leave, then just slide down.

But, let's get that item. So slide up, left, down, left, down, right, up,
left, up, to get back to the starting location.

Now, again, on the right of the two entrance squares, go:

Down, left, down, left, up, right, down, right, then down. Get the PP UP.

To leave, from the PP Up, go up, right, up, left, down, right, down.

And there's the exit. We're done with the ICE PATH!

----------------------------- BLACKTHORN CITY [078] --------------------------

Blackthorn City is pretty small. Heal up at the Pokemon Center. The MOVE
DELETER is in this city, which may be useful if there is an HM move you've
been wanting to get rid of.

There is a Pokemon trade, a DRAGONAIR (female) for a DODRIO, in the top right
house.

After you visit everything in the city, go to the GYM, which is in the top
left part, with a body of water behind it.

-------------------------- BLACKTHORN CITY GYM [079] -------------------------

Go forward, and you will get some tips, and your Pokemon will have to stay
in it's Pokeball. Ice Pokemon, or other Dragon Pokemon, will work well in this
Gym. It may be tough, but it's not impossible.

Once again, there are small puzzles, involving the floor shape and movement.
I will provide a step-by-step. It will be nice to save before each platform,
in case you mess up the order, as it's hard to re-align it. It would be
quicker to just load game. There are teleporters that will take you back to
the entrance if needed.

So, on the first one:

Press the LEFT ARROW, BLUE CIRCLE, BLUE CIRCLE, RIGHT ARROW.

Then, go forward and fight:

ACE TRAINER PAULO (2100P)

 -DRATINI LV 35 (M) 502 EXP

   Agility [Psychic/Status]

  -Moves:

Be wary of the two Hyper Potions she will use when you lower the health of
her Pokemon.

After you defeat her...you don't get the badge. Instead, she wants you to take
a challenge. It's not as bad as it sounds, and you get a nice reward, so let's
go!

----------------------------- BLACKTHORN CITY [080] --------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center. You will need a Pokemon with SURF and
WHIRLPOOL. If you can, free a space in your party. If not, don't worry about
it right now.

When you got what you need, go to the Gym, and SURF behind it, going up, and 
you will see a Cave Entrance. Enter it.

------------------------------ DRAGON'S DEN [081] ----------------------------

1F:

Go forward, and down the ladder.

B1F:

Go forward and fight:

ACE TRAINER KOBE (2220P)

 -DRAGONAIR LV 37 (M) 1141 EXP
  -Type: Dragon
  -Moves:
   Thunder [Electric/Special]

You will reach a dock. Start surfing, and SURF left. Keep going, until you
see a lone Ace Trainer. Go and battle her:

ACE TRAINER PIPER (2100P)

 -HORSEA LV 33 (F) 586 EXP
  -Type: Water

  -Moves:

 -DRATINI LV 35 (F) 500 EXP
  -Type: Dragon
  -Moves:
   Thunderbolt [Electric/Special]

Now pick up the MAX ELIXIR below them. Now SURF, and use WHIRLPOOL on the
whirlpool to the right. Cross it, then enter the structure there. It will
automatically take you into a scene where the master speaks to you.

Answer the questions in this order:

1 - Friend
2 - Strategy
3 - Anyone
4 - Love
5 - Both

When everything is answered, you will get the Rising Badge. But, no TM...

Well, SURF back to the entrance, and on your way out, Clair will talk to you,
and give you TM59 DRAGON PULSE. 

Leave the place, back to Blackthorn.

----------------------------- BLACKTHORN CITY [082] --------------------------

You will get a call from PROF. ELM, saying he has something for you. You can
FLY if you want, but I would advise you just take the Routes south of
BLACKTHORN CITY. There are some Pokemon you can get there as well as a lot
of Trainers to battle. Whatever you do is fine. I will likely skip over the
two Routes and include them later for convenience.

**************************** POKEMON LEAGUE [CH10] ***************************

This section goes all the way up to defeating the ELITE FOUR and becoming
Champion. It includes the capturing of Ho-Oh and Lugia in HeartGold and
SoulSilver respectively.

------------------------------- ROUTE 45 [083] -------------------------------

There are three ways to go on this path. I'll start by going left. Then the
middle, then the right side.

Left Path:

The Left path refers to taking the first bridge left upon entering the Route,
and hugging the left wall as you go downward.

Go past the DARK CAVE entrance, and go into the patch of grass. Pick up the
ELIXIR at the end of the grass, then go down the stairs and hop the ledge.

Hop the ledge again, and you will run into:

HIKER PARRY (960P) PokeGear

 -ONIX LV 30 (M) 693 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

Go down from him, hop another ledge. Hop another ledge into the grass patch,
and there is a FULL HEAL. Go down from there, and hop another ledge. Grab
the NUGGET. Hop again, into another field. At the bottom of that field, is
yet another ledge. Hop it. Grab the REVIVE, keep going southward. You will
eventually go down a stairway. There is a boy there you can talk to. Go down
more, and hop another ledge. Go left down the stairway to reach ROUTE 46.

Right Path:

The Right path refers to skipping the first bridge on the left, hopping the
first ledge, then going down the right stairway.

You will face:

ACE TRAINER RYAN (1620P)

 -PIDGEOT LV 25 (M) 921 EXP
  -Type: Normal/Flying

 -ELECTABUZZ LV 27 (M) 901 EXP
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Light Screen [Normal/Status]

You will then go down, and it converges with the center path.

Center Path:

The center path refers to when you enter Route 45, and go downward past the
first bridge, then before the second bridge, you hop the ledges in the center,
not on the right (to the left of the patch of grass, basically.)

Hop two ledges, and you will run into:

HIKER ERIK (864P)

 -MACHOP LV 24 (M) 385 EXP
  -Type: Fighting

 -GRAVELER LV 27 (M) 774 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -MACHOP LV 27 (M) 433 EXP
  -Type: Fighting

Go south from him, hopping a ledge and entering a grassfield. Keep going down,
you will go down some stairs. Skip the bridge to your left, keep going down.
Hop the ledge, and grab the MAX POTION to the right. The right path converges
with the center path here. Go down and fight:

ACE TRAINER KELLY (1440P)

 -MARILL LV 27 (F) 334 EXP
  -Type: Water
  -Moves:
   Aqua Ring [Water/Status]
   Rollout [Rock/Physical]

 -WARTORTLE LV 24 (M) 735 EXP
  -Type: Water

 -WARTORTLE LV 24 (M) 735 EXP
  -Type: Water

Ignore the bridge to the left, and hop the ledges on the right. You will run
into:

BLACK BELT KENJI (672P) PokeGear

 -MACHOKE LV 28 (M) 876 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Foresight [Normal/Status]
   Seismic Toss [Fighting/Physical]

Hop off, and go down. There is another split, where the right path continues.
Take the right path, as you can battle the same trainer in the center path.
If you don't want to battle them, just hop down the center ledges.

If you went right, you will run into:

HIKER MICHAEL (800P)

 -GEODUDE LV 25 (M) 390 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock
 
 -GRAVELER LV 25 (M) 717 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -GOLEM LV 25 (M) 948 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

Hop the ledge below, and then go left and fight the other Hiker, who you would
have fought having gone down the center:

HIKER TIMOTHY (864P)

 -DIGLETT LV 27 (M) 468 EXP
  -Type: Ground

 -DUGTRIO LV 27 (M) 885 EXP
  -Type: Ground
  -Moves:
   Sand-Attack [Normal/Status]

Go down, hop a ledge, keep going, down a stairway, and you will reach a small
pool of water. Grab the GRN APRICORN in the bottom right. Hop the ledge, and
then go left across the bridge. Go left and down the stairway.

------------------------------- ROUTE 46 [084] -------------------------------

No matter which path you took above, you will reach here. Go left past the
cave entrance, and take the small path between the trees, at the end is a 
YLW and GRN APRICORN. Grab them.

Now go back through the path, then go south, hopping the ledge. You can hop
two ways here, left and down:

If you go left:

You will run into: (It is possible to have a double battle with the two
trainers if standing between them.)

CAMPER TED (272P)

 -MANKEY LV 17 (M) 268 EXP
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:
   Focus Energy [Normal/Status]

After him, there is:

PICNICKER ERIN (224P) PokeGear

 -PONYTA LV 17 (F) 553 EXP
  -Type: Fire

 -ODDISH LV 14 (F) 234 EXP
  -Type: Grass

If you've been following this guide, their levels are very low in comparison
because this is assuming you came out of the DARK CAVE, which I left as a
sidequest to explore.

Anyway, grab the X SPEED to the left, then go down, hopping the ledge, and
out into the lower Route. 

If you go down:

Go forward and fight:

HIKER BAILEY (832P)

 -GEODUDE LV 13 (M) 202 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -GEODUDE LV 13 (M) 202 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -GEODUDE LV 13 (M) 202 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -GEODUDE LV 13 (M) 202 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

 -GEODUDE LV 13 (M) 202 EXP
  -Type: Ground/Rock

Then hop the ledge.

You can now FLY to NEW BARK TOWN, or walk there, as it's within walking 
distance. I'll assume you're using FLY, though.

---------------------------- NEW BARK TOWN [085] -----------------------------

Head to PROFESSOR ELM's LAB. Inside, you will meet ETHAN/LYRA, and PROFESSOR
ELM. They will talk a little, and you will receive the MASTER BALL!

Then ELM tells you the Kimono Girls were looking for you. Well, they won't
let us go to the League without visiting them first, so exit the lab and
FLY to ECRUTEAK CITY.

----------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY [086] ----------------------------

Heal up your Pokemon, as the next fight is considered to be pretty
challenging if not prepared. When ready, head to ECRUTEAK DANCE THEATER.

BUMP. Rival again! No battle, though. He will pout a bit on his loss, then
run away. Now enter the Theater.

------------------------ ECRUTEAK DANCE THEATER [087] ------------------------

Inside, you head up to the platform with the five girls on it. There will
be some talking, and then if you don't feel prepared, say NO.

The way this works is that all five will fight you with no breaks, so be
prepared. The order is PSYCHIC, DARK, FIRE, ELECTRIC, and WATER. So prepare
a Pokemon in that possible order to counter if you wish. When ready, speak
to them and say YES to begin!

  -Moves:

After all that, you will receive the CLEAR BELL [HEARTGOLD], or the TIDAL
BELL [SOULSILVER].

They will leave. Exit the Theater yourself.

----------------------------- ECRUTEAK CITY [088] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center. Stock up on Revives/Balls if you wish.

Okay, the guide will have to split here. If you are playing HEARTGOLD version,
then read the next sections: [089A], [090A], and [091A].

If you are playing SOULSILVER version, then read the sections [089B], [090B]
and [091B].

Both will come back together at [092].

HeartGold players, go to the BARRIER STATION at the north side of the city!

SoulSilver players, FLY to CIANWOOD CITY!

---------------------------- BARRIER STATION [089A] --------------------------

In here, head right and talk to the man blocking the passage way to the
stairway. He will move, and then go down.

Follow the corridor to the end. Go up the stairs.

---------------------------- BELLCHIME TRAIL [090A] --------------------------

The path is linear. Follow it all the way to the end, and there stands the
tower. Enter!

------------------------------ BELL TOWER [091A] -----------------------------

1F:

Go left and up, toward a man standing next to a ladder. He will interrupt,
and will then let you through. Go up the ladder.

2F:

Another straightforward floor, go down and there is a ladder at the bottom. Go
up.

3F:

On this floor, you will notice ramps on the sides. You can only cross over
one-way. So first, go to the ramp to the left of you, facing left. Hop across
and get the FULL HEAL.

Now hop back using the ramp above that. Now go right and hop across that
ramp. Go up, and hop left across two ramps. Make your way around the central
pillar, and hop across two more ramps. Go up, and hop across three ramps going
to the right.

You can't see the ramp with the pillar in the way, go all the way up, touching
the wall, then go down one step, and then head right and you will hop across
a ramp. Now go down and hop across two more ramps. Go up the ladder.

4F:

There...are a lot of ramps in this room. I will just name the directions you
should hop to avoid confusion.

First, hop down, left, down, left, down, down, and grab the item to the right,
it's an ULTRA BALL. Now go right, down, left, down, down. You should be on a
platform with an item and a ladder. Grab the PP UP. This ladder serves no
purpose, so ignore it.

Go left, left, then up the platform. Now, hop left, left, left, down, right,
right, down, left, left, down, left, left. You should be at the bottom left
of the room, with another platform with an item and a ladder. Grab the
ESCAPE ROPE. This ladder, like the last one, is also a "return ladder." So
ignore it for now.

Go up this platform, and hop right twice. Go up again, and hop left twice.
There is another ladder. Go up this one.

5F:

If you want a RARE CANDY, then follow the directions below. It will cause you
to go down a floor and come back around, however. If you want to skip it, then
ignore the paragraph below.

Hop right twice, go all the way to the right side, then down a bit. Hop left
across twice, then down twice. You should be at the center of the room, grab
the RARE CANDY. Now hop right, then down, and go down the ladder. On the
fourth floor, follow the instructions from the bottom right ladder (the one
that serves no purpose) and make it back to the fifth floor.

Ignoring the RARE CANDY, or if you picked it up; follow below:

Hop right twice (from the starting ladder), then take the first hop down. Go
left, then hop left once, then down once. Take the left path, hopping down
twice. Then, take the right path, hopping downward four times.

Go up this ladder.

6F:

Go forward and pick up the MAX POTION. Then go right across a bridge, and up.
Ignore the first of the two bridges, and take the top one. Cross it, and grab
the FULL HEAL.

Now hop down twice and go up the ladder.

7F:

Woohoo, Warp Panels. These yellow squares warp you to a corresponding square
elsewhere.

Well, here's a brief side trip for you to take. Take the first warp panel you 
see, going up from the ladder.

Take the only other warp panel on this platform. Now go down.Hop in this
order:

(First) Left, left, left, down, left, left, and left. Warp at this panel.

Hop left, grab the NUGGET, hop right, warp.

Now hop left, down, down, right, right, and right. Warp at this panel.

Grab the MAX ELIXIR. Warp on the panel you came from. Now take four hops
right. Go up and warp at the only other panel. Then warp at the only other
panel here.

We should be back where we started. Hop right five times, grab the MAX
REVIVE. Hop down five times. Head left, and take remaining Warp panel.

8F:

Head down across the bridge, take the first warp panel. Grab the HP UP. Go to
the panel at the end of the area. Warp. Head up across the bridge. Ignore
the panel for a second, cross the bridge going left, grab the FULL RESTORE.

Now head back across the bridge and take the first warp panel you see. Take
this ladder you see, the only other thing on the platform.

9F:

Just one other ladder here. Go up!

10F:

Finally, the top! Go up, and a brief scene will commence involving the Kimono
Girls. HO-OH will appear!

You will have time to save after Zuki is done talking. Once she is, save, and
speak to HO-OH to begin the battle!

HO-OH LV 45 (X) 1414 EXP
 -Ability: Pressure
 -Type: Fire/Flying
 -Moves:
  Fire Blast [Fire/Special]
  Extrasensory [Psychic/Special]
  Sunny Day [Fire/Status]
  Sacred Fire [Fire/Physical]

You can try and endure it, throwing balls at it often, weakining it both in
HP and status, etc. Or you can throw a MASTER BALL at it and get it over
with. Alternately, you can KO it, and you will get another chance later down
the line. I advise you capture it now, though.

Whatever you choose, after you defeat/capture it, FLY to NEW BARK TOWN. You're
done here!

---------------------------- CIANWOOD CITY [089B] ----------------------------

You will need a Pokemon with SURF and WHIRLPOOL. FLASH is also very helpful,
as the cave is dark. While you could attempt to navigate it, it is much
easier to illuminate the cave.

Go to the northern part of the city, face east, and SURF. We are aiming to
enter the WHIRL ISLANDS from the NORTHEAST (Top RIGHT) side. So we are looking
for the WHIRLPOOL closest to OLIVINE CITY.

------------------------------- ROUTE 41 [090B] -------------------------------

Basically, if you SURF from north CIANWOOD, skip the first WHIRLPOOL you see,
keep going right, then down, and it will be that one.

Once you cross over it, make your way into the entrance.

---------------------------- WHIRL ISLANDS [091B] ----------------------------

1F:

Use FLASH to illuminate the cave. Now proceed forward and hop off the ledge.
The path splits in two, take the upper path, hop the ledge, go up, and go
down the ladder at the end of the passageway.

B1F:

Go down, and follow the linear path until you reach a ladder, go down this
ladder.

B2F:

Grab the MAX REVIVE to your left, then go down, and take the right path down.
You will see a man standing there. Speak to him!

He moves aside, now go down the series of ramps, ignoring the tunnel. There is
a cave entrance at the bottom of all the ramps. Enter it.

WATERFALL BASIN:

You will enter to see a scene with the Kimono Girls, they will briefly talk,
then begin a ceremony.

LUGIA will appear! Don't worry if you didn't save, you won't battle right
away. After she's done talking, I advise you save, and get ready to battle
LUGIA.

Go up to the water, SURF, head to the LUGIA, and press A to begin the battle!

LUGIA LV 45 (X) 1413 EXP
 -Ability: Pressure
 -Type: Psychic/Flying
 -Moves:
  Rain Dance [Water/Status]
  Hydro Pump [Water/Special]
  Aeroblast [Flying/Special]
  Extrasensory [Psychic/Special]

You can capture or KO it, you will get another chance after the Elite Four
to capture it if you want. You can either throw the MASTER BALL and get it
over with, or you can weaken it, give it a status ailment, and keep trying
to use conventional balls to capture it. Either way, capture or defeat, you're
done here.

Either use an ESCAPE ROPE, or backtrack out the same way we came in.

Then FLY to NEW BARK TOWN!

---------------------------- NEW BARK TOWN [092] -----------------------------

Note that you will not be able to heal for awhile in this next part. You will
be able to FLY back, but I advise you heal up and buy recovery items from
other stores.

When you're ready:

There is a body of water right next to your home. Face east, and SURF.

------------------------------- ROUTE 27 [093] -------------------------------

SURF east until you see a place you can get off. Take a few steps to the
right, and a man will welcome you to KANTO. There is a cave near him, enter
it.

------------------------------ TOHJO FALLS [094] -----------------------------

This is a very straightforward cave. SURF up, and use WATERFALL to go up the
waterfall.

Now make your way down the linear path of water, then go down the second
waterfall.

Let's get an item quickly, so instead of SURFing to the exit, SURF to the
right, and you will see a stairway. Go there. On the stairway, run all the
way to the end, and grab the MOON STONE.

Now go back, SURF, and go to the exit to the cave.

------------------------------- ROUTE 27 [095] -------------------------------

Back out of the cave, you can try and avoid the Trainer, or just fight them:

ACE TRAINER MEGAN (1920P)

 -BULBASAUR LV 32 (M) 438 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Leech Seed [Grass/Status]

  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Petal Dance [Grass/Physical]

After her, if you go inside the house, and you have a Pokemon with a high
happiness level, the lady will give you TM37 SANDSTORM.

Now leave the house, and go behind the Ace Trainer, and SURF east. You can
either arrive at the grass patches in the north, or go more east and land
next to another Ace Trainer. Battle him!

ACE TRAINER BLAKE (1860P)

 -MAGNETON LV 33 (X) 1136 EXP
  -Type: Electric/Steel

 -QUAGSIRE LV 31 (M) 909 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ground
  -Moves:

   Water Gun [Water/Special]

 -EXEGGCUTE LV 31 (M) 651 EXP
  -Type: Grass/Psychic
  -Moves:
   Leech Seed [Grass/Status]

Now go east, and you will reach some docks. Battle the Trainer who is going
back and forth:

ACE TRAINER BRIAN  (2100P)

 -MAREEP LV 35 (M) 442 EXP
  -Type: Electric
  -Moves:
   Signal Beam [Bug/Special]
   Cotton Spore [Grass/Status]

Keep going east, and then you will reach a set of stairs. Go up, take the
next flight and the flight after (past the grass patches), then head right,
and down two sets of stairs. Grab the DESTINY KNOT on the left, then descend
the last set of stairs, and battle the Psychic standing there:

 -ESPEON LV 36 (M) 1519 EXP

Ignore the left path, and take the north one instead. Keep going north, and 
you will see a house. Finally, a place to heal. Enter it, heal up. You can
use this as your Pokemon Center of the Route.

Go outside, and fight the Ace Trainer on the left side of the house:

ACE TRAINER JOYCE (2160P)

  -Type: Electric

 -BLASTOISE LV 36 (M) 1620 EXP

Grab the BLU APRICORN, then go up the stairs. Keep going north, and ignore

instead, and down the road, you will eventually fight:

Lastly, continue down the linear path, and you will face a final trainer in
this Route:

ACE TRAINER JAMIE (1860P) PokeGear

 -RAPIDASH LV 36 (F) 1480 EXP
  -Type: Fire

 -FLAFFY LV 31 (F) 777 EXP
  -Type: Electric

Now enter the building at the top. This is the Reception Gate.

Go forward, and go through the security guard. He will let you in after seeing
all Eight badges. You will notice two more guards. The left goes to MT.
SILVER, which we cannot access right now. The right goes to VIRIDIAN CITY,
but the road is blocked, so, only one way to go. Forward. Victory Road is
beyond the gate.

You can FLY back to the reception gate, so if you need more preparations, then
do so now. There are no Trainers in Victory Road, except the very end, where
you will fight your RIVAL. You will need a Pokemon with STRENGTH, and while
it is not a requirement, ROCK SMASH would be nice if you will be using the
DOWSING MCHN to find hidden items. When you are ready, enter VICTORY ROAD.

----------------------------- VICTORY ROAD [097] -----------------------------

1F:

Head forward, and use STRENGTH to push the boulder upward. When the path is
clear, go left, and keep going until you go down a stair way. You can find
some nice things with the DOWSING MACHINE, so I advise you keep using it.

Go up, then right, following the path, as it's the only way you can go. (The
north path is covered with a ledge.)

Keep going right, and grab the POTION. Go left up the long stairway, and then
north over the wood bridge. At the end of the bridge, go left, then down the
stairway. Go right, and grab the FULL HEAL.

Now go left, until you reach a fork with a path going north, and one going
south. Let's go north. Keep going up until you reach a place with a long
stairway and two boulders. Push the lower boulder to the right by one square.
Now go down around it, and go right, winding your way to the item. Grab the
item, a MAX REVIVE. Now backtrack to the boulders, and go up the long
stairway.

There is a ladder, go up.

2F:

Go downward, ignoring the boulder and item at the top. Go down and right,
where you should see two sets of small stairs. Go up both flights, then to
the right. Follow the winding path, and eventually you will get to a ladder.

Ignore the lower stairway. Go up the ladder.

3F:

Drop down the only hole in this room.

2F:

When you land, get off the space, turn around and check it, you will get an
ULTRA BALL.

Go up, and you should see a boulder. Push it to the left only ONCE, then go
down the stairs, and up the next stairway, so you just went around the
boulder.

Grab the FULL RESTORE. Now push that boulder to the right, and go up the
stairway it was in front of.

Another stairway, and at the top there is a ladder, go up.

3F:

Ignore the hole in front of you, and keep going downward. Evetually you will
see a stairway going up, so go up. Go forward and get the item, and if you
have a Pokemon with ROCK SMASH, then smash the rocks around. The item is an
ULTRA BALL.

Go down and left down the path, this time. Follow the pathway as it winds
around, eventually leading you to two holes. Take the upper hole.

2F:

Grab the HP UP, then hop the ledge, and take the ladder back up to the third
floor.

3F:

Follow the path upward, when you reach a path that goes north, take it. Don't
go right, yet. Go around the hole you see, and grab the RARE CANDY that is
hiding behind the rocks.

Now drop down that hole.

2F:

Go left, and take the long stairway down, and pick up the very useful TM26
EARTHQUAKE. Now go back up the long stairway, then go left, and take the
ladder.

3F:

Go right, and hop the ledge. Now you are back before you dropped. Go down,
and then head right. You will see three smashable rocks with an item beyond
them. Smash the three rocks, and pick up the item. It's TM79 DARK PULSE.

Now, I advise you save. You will be fighting your RIVAL on the way out. Heal
up your Pokemon using items if needed.

Head to the exit, which is up and right, and you will be interuppted by your
rival:

Be sure to look for which starter you chose below!

After he's gone, head up, and out of VICTORY ROAD.

---------------------------- INDIGO PLATEAU [098] ----------------------------

Go straight up the path, and enter. This is both a Pokemon Center and a shop.
The Elite Four is fought four in a row, of which you then go on to the
champion. There are breaks in between, but there is no turning back once you
go on. As such, stock up on all the items you think you will need. You do
get breaks in between each member to heal up, but no returning to the Pokemon
Center or Shop until after you are Champion.

I recommend your Pokemon to all be LV 40 or above, however, it can be done
at lower levels, too.

Ready? Proceed up the stairs, and through the exit in the back.

------------------------------ ELITE FOUR [099] ------------------------------

First Room:

Proceed forward, and talk to the only other person. Get ready for battle:

General Tips: Remember, they usually have about three FULL RESTORES at their
disposal, so if they're down to red health, you can count on them using it.

Tips: For Will, who is a Psychic user, it is good to have those that can
damage the Psychic. However, he has a lot of dual types, meaning you can
take advantage of the other weaknesses (Such as Xatu being flying, so Rock
or Electric can take it down, while Exeggutor is weak to flying/fire.) His
defense is generally low, so you should use Physical moves over Special moves.
Most of his brutal attacks are Special (that is, Psychic), so high Special
Defense helps, too.

ELITE FOUR WILL (5040P)

 -XATU LV 40 (F) 1465 EXP

  -Type: Psychic/Flying
  -Moves:

Second Room:

Speak to the only other person. Get ready to fight:

Tips: Koga, as he says, likes status draining. All his Pokemon are vulnerable
to Psychic attacks. Forretress has double weakness to fire. His last two
Pokemon have weaknesses to Electric/Rock. He isn't too difficult, strike
fast, though.

   Quick Attack [Normal/Physical]
   Poison Fang [Poison/Physical]

After him, proceed to the next room.

Third Room:

Speak to the only other person. Get ready to fight:

Tips: Bruno has all fighting. All are weak to Psychic and Flying. His
Machamp is the most dangerous, while the others aren't too hard to handle.
They have high attack, and low Special attack. Make sure you have a good
defense and high Special attack. High Attack works just as well, though.

ELITE FOUR BRUNO (5520P)

 -HITMONTOP LV 42 (M) 1242 EXP
  -Ability: Technician
  -Type: Fighting
  -Moves:

Fourth Room:

Talk to the only other person, get ready to fight!

Tips: Karen uses mostly Dark Pokemon, with the exception of Vileplume and
Gengar, which a Psychic can handle. Fighting Pokemon would be good, but once 
again, you can take adventage of the dual type Pokemon. Umbreon is the only 
pure Dark one you fight. Be wary of Houndoom.

ELITE FOUR KAREN (5640P)

 -UMBREON LV 42 (M) 1773 EXP
  -Ability: Synchronize

  -Type: Dark/Fire
  -Moves:
   Nasty Plot [Dark/Status]
   Dark Pulse [Dark/Special]
   Flamethrower [Fire/Special]
   Crunch [Dark/Physical]

Well, that's the Elite Four...now just the Champion...

------------------------------- CHAMPION [100] -------------------------------

The final battle before you become Champion! And well, look who it is. Not
like that was unexpected.

Save, heal, do as you want, this is probably the hardest of the five:

Tips: Lance, being a Dragon master, has a weakness to Ice. However, his
Charizard is to compensate. The three Dragonites can also get annoying, with
high Defense and Special Defense. Gyarados goes down to Electric easily. It
should not be a problem. Use Electric on both Gyarados and Charizard (Rock
works well, too.) And focus on using Ice, if possible, on the remainder.
Aerodactyl is very speedy, but falls quickly to Electric/Rock/Ice attacks.

Congratulations, you are now the Pokemon Champion. You will skip the
interview, and enter the HALL OF FAME! Enjoy the credits, it took exactly
100 sections to get here, neat, huh?

============================= KANTO JOURNEY [KHT] ============================

This is technically "post=game", but is a significantly large amount of the
game, and is included in the main walkthrough.

This covers getting the eight Kanto Badges, the second half of the game.

These chapters are significantly shorter, as the Gym's are accessible and not
too far apart.

****************************** CHAPTER 11 [CH11] *****************************

From becoming Champion to getting the Vermillion City Badge.

----------------------------- NEW BARK TOWN [101] ----------------------------

Back home! Go downstairs, and out the door. Head to Professor Elm's lab. When
there, speak to Elm to receive the S.S. Ticket! Now we can head onboard the
S.S. Aqua and head for Kanto!

When he done talking, exit and FLY to OLIVINE CITY.

----------------------------- OLIVINE CITY [102] -----------------------------

Go down to the Olivine City Fast-Ship Pair, which extends out into the water,
and enter the structure there.

You will run into Professor Oak, who will upgrade your Pokedex to NATIONAL
MODE, giving you the NATIONAL DEX. He will then leave. Talk to the Sailor
blocking the southern exit. He will move aside, now exit down that way.

Follow the path to the Sailor standing in front of the ship, and talk to him
to be let into the ship.

------------------------------ S.S. AQUA [103] -------------------------------

1F:

Go a little forward and you will run into somebody who is looking for his
granddaughter. We will need to find her to get off the ship. However, we have
Trainers to fight, so let's get to that. Note that the room on the far right
of this floor is your room, where you can heal your party by sleeping in the
bed.

Anyway, head left, and go into the room top left room. The man who is looking
for his granddaughter is here. Now go to the room next to it.

Inside, there are a pair of twins and a man on the left. Fight the man first,

The door left of your room has a sleeping sailor, but we'll come back and
wake him up later.

Head to the center of the hall, then go up and then go down the stairs.

Go down, and take a left into the multiple bed room. Go to the top left, and

He will rush off. Now we can proceed. Go back to the stairway and down.

B1F:

Go down and right, and now that Sailor will let you through. Go up to see a

 -SEAKING LV 41 (F) 1492 EXP
  -Type: Water

Talk to the little girl next to the Captain. She will want to play Hide and
Seek. Leave the room, and go down the ladder.

Head to the far left side of this room, past the mutliple bed room. There is
a small hall there, the girl is there. Talk to her. She will go back to her
Grandpa.

1F:

You will be there, too. The Grandpa will give you a METAL COAT. The ship
will then announce arrival. 

Leave the room, go right in the hallway, talk to the Sailor, he will move,
then exit the ship.

------------------------------ VERMILION CITY [104] --------------------------

How nostalgic.

Follow the path to the building. Enter it. Talk to the Sailor and he will
move aside.

Leave the building, and follow the path, and you will run into SUICUNE and
EUSINE again. After a brief scene, they will leave. Now keep going up.

Take a left as soon as you get on the land, and you are in the city. Heal up
at the Pokemon Center. Head to the Pokemon Fan Club [Left side of the city],
and go inside. Talk to the president, who is the Gentlemen in the top right,
and say "yes." You will receive a RARE CANDY after hearing his story. We
will come back here later for something else, so keep the building in mind.

Now get ready to head for the Gym. You need a Pokemon with either CUT or SURF.

When ready, go to the Gym. You can either CUT the tree out of the way, or
SURF around to get to the Gym.

Either way, enter.

--------------------------- VERMILION CITY GYM [105] -------------------------

Before we do anything with the switches, we will battle the three Trainers in
the room.

So take three steps left from the entrance, then go up and fight the Trainer.
(If you take one step left and go up, you will be in a double battle with
the Trainer right after the one listed below):

JUGGLER HORTON (1376P) <Possible Double Battle with GUITARIST VINCENT>

  -Type: Electric

You should heal up at the Pokemon Center and then come back here. Okay, now
to turn that fence off. Look in all the trash cans laid out around the room.
As soon as you find the first switch, as the Trainer said, the other should
be right next to it. If you mess up, it resets, and the switch changes
location. It's randomized, so I can't do much to help you.

Once you the fence is unlocked, head up and talk to Surge to begin!

Tips: Most of his Pokemon are fast, and have the move Shock Wave, which is
a never-missing Electric move. All of them, aside from MAGNETON fall easily
to Magnitude/Earthquake. MAGNETON can be handled with a fighting move. If
using one weak against fighting, be wary of ELECTABUZZ's low kick.

Heal up at the Pokemon Center. Then, head north out of the city into Route
6!

****************************** CHAPTER 12 [CH12] *****************************

This covers the second Kanto Badge, that is, SAFFRON CITY's badge.

------------------------------- ROUTE 06 [107] -------------------------------

you see a large building. This is Silph. Co. Go inside. Go left, and to the
top left of the room, where there is an elevator. Talk to the guard next to
it, and you will receive the UP-GRADE. Now head out.

Head left, then up, to the next road. There is one house you can go inside,
do so. Go upstairs, and talk to the girl there. You won't get anything yet,
but keep this house in mind for later. Head down and out.

Now let's head for the Gym, it's in the top right of the city. Enter it.

Tips: She has three Pokemon, all which know Psychic and Skill Swap. Psychic
will do heavy damage to your Pokemon which don't have a high special defense,
so watch out for it. Her Pokemon have a general high speed, too, so they may
attack first most of the time. You would have to have well trained Pokemon,
or hit her hard and fast. Her Pokemon have high special defense too, so you
may want to use physical moves!

****************************** CHAPTER 13 [CH13] *****************************

This covers the third Kanto Badge, that is, CELADON CITY's badge.

------------------------------- ROUTE 07 [111] -------------------------------

There are no Trainers on this Route, and the Underground is locked. So just
head straight west into CELADON CITY.

----------------------------- CELADON CITY [112] -----------------------------

Not as many things to do here as it may look. First, go to the Department
Store, you can buy some TMs and other useful items that are not avaliable
in Goldenrod City. On the second floor, talk to CRASHER WAKE, who is standing
in the top right. He will give you the TURTWIG MASK, CHIMCHAR MASK, and the
PIPLUP MASK. These are three accessories. Now exit the Department Store.

There is also a Game Corner. The Tips man is inside there, but he doesn't tip
you on the Gym.

To get to the Gym, you will need a Pokemon that knows CUT. Once you have the
Pokemon, go to the bottom right of the city, and CUT the cuttable tree that is
there to access the path that leads to the Gym.

Enter the Gym!

--------------------------- CELADON CITY GYM [113] ---------------------------

It's all Grass type, in case you didn't realize already.

This Gym is a mini-maze. Start by cutting the Tree in the middle, then go up,
adn then left (where you see two openings, on the left side of the center
path, and right side of the left path.) Go up and you will run into twins:

TWINS JO & ZOE (1504P) <Double Battle>

 -VICTREEBEL LV 47 (F) 1902 EXP
  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:
   Giga Drain [Grass/Special]

 -VILEPLUME LV 47 (F) 1850 EXP
  -Type: Grass/Poison
  -Moves:
   Stun Spore [Grass/Status]

Go back down from them, and take the first right as soon as it allows you to. 
Now go up, right, and down, following the narrow path, eventually turning 
right where the sprinkler is, into an opening. You should now be in the right 
path.

Take a right turn to fight a Trainer. Don't if you want to skip her:

LASS MICHELLE (736P)

 -SKIPLOOM LV 44 (F) 1281 EXP
  -Type: Grass/Flying
  -Moves:

  -Type: Grass
  -Moves:

 -PARASECT LV 47 (F) 1288 EXP
  -Type: Grass/Bug 

Now go down, take the first left out. Go down and left a bit so you are back
in the left path. Then go up and left out of the left path to the thin path
hugging the wall. Go up and CUT the tree, then follow the path to Erika, using
CUT with the one tree behind Julia.

If you need to heal, backtrack out of the Gym, heal, then follow the path back
here.

Get ready to fight!

Tips: Erika, all Grass, is weak to Fire and Flying, mostly. The only Pokemon
she has with an anti-Flying move is Tangela, with "AncientPower." The rest
do not have a way to counter. Be wary of Sunny Day + Synthesis/SolarBeam, as
that SolarBeam fires instantly, and Synthesis will heal a lot more. She should
not be too difficult overall.

----------------------------- CELADON CITY [114] -----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center, then head west out of the city.

****************************** CHAPTER 14 [CH14] *****************************

This covers up to the fourth Kanto Badge, that is FUSCHIA CITY's badge.

------------------------------- ROUTE 16 [115] -------------------------------

No Trainers, just a straightforward path. There is a cuttable tree that leads
to a secluded house, which a man gives trendy sayings, but that's it. Follow
the path left and down, and enter the border house. You will be forced to
get on your Bike.

------------------------------- ROUTE 17 [116] -------------------------------

This path is also known as the "CYCLING ROAD." There are Trainers along the
way down. You will start to go downward automatically, as it's a downhill
slope.

FUCHsIA CITY.

------------------------------ FUCHSIA CITY [118] ----------------------------

There is a Shard trader in the city, as well as PAL PARK. But we're here for
the Gym, so head south, where the Gym and Pokemon Center are. Heal up, then
head for the Gym.

---------------------------- FUCHSIA CITY GYM [119] --------------------------

There are invisible walls in here, making it another maze-like Gym. I will
give you the exact steps. I submitted a map of the Gym that you can see if
you cannot understand my wording.

So, go to the tile that is second from the right, and go straight up. You
will run into a Janine-clone, talk to her:

PICNICKER CINDY (768P)

 -NIDOQUEEN LV 48 (F) 1995 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Ground
  -Moves:

Then take one step right, so you are against the right wall. Go up all the
way, so you are in the top right. Now go all the way across to the top left.
Go down until you hit a wall, then go right until you hit a wall. Now go down
until you hit a wall again, then go left, and talk to the other Janine-clone
from behind:

CAMPER BARRY (768P)

 -NIDOKING LV 48 (M) 2005 EXP
  -Type: Poison/Ground

Go left one square, down two squares, and then all the way to the right to
fight:

  -Moves:
   Sludge Bomb [Poison/Special]

Now go to the final person, the Gym Leader, get ready to fight!

Tips: She uses Poison, but she has three Bugs on her team, making her weak to
Flying attacks. A Psychic Pokemon would really do well, here, too. High speed
and special attack will allow you to win this one easily. The Crobat may seem
deadly, but it only has one physical attack, which can be handled if against
a Rock, as it is Flying as well. It shouldn't be too hard of a battle.

------------------------------- ROUTE 14 [122] -------------------------------

We'll go up first to fight some Trainers. But if you want to skip them, go

Going up, you will first run into:

SCHOOL KID CONNOR (840P)

There is the Kanto Radio Tower in this city, as well as a NAME RATER. Keep the
Radio Tower in mind, as we will be coming back later. To the North is the
Rock Tunnel. There are no Trainers inside, just low level Pokemon and items.

For this reason, I am going to be taking a slightly different Route that
goes around the Rock Tunnel, but the Rock Tunnel will be included in the cave
exploration section of this FAQ.

If you want to skip unecessary Trainer battling, then skip down to SAFFRON
CITY [127].

So go north, as there are two Trainers we will fight in Route 10.

------------------------------- ROUTE 10 [126] -------------------------------

There are two trainers to fight, and an item to get. First, go up the stairs

Heal up, and this time exit the Town west, to Route 8.

------------------------------- ROUTE 08 [128] -------------------------------

If you skipped the long routes from Fuchsia to Lavender Town, then you can
get here by Flying to Saffron and exiting east. Make sure you go to Lavender
Town, so we can fly there later.

Anyway, assuming you left LAVENDER TOWN west, go up and grab the YLW APRICORN.
Now go down, and left, and fight:

GENTLEMAN MILTON (9000P)

 -GROWLITHE LV 45 (M) 877 EXP

------------------------------ SAFFRON CITY [129] ----------------------------

Heal up here, and then exit NORTH. This is the section you want to be at if
you were skipping Trainers earlier.

------------------------------- ROUTE 05 [130] -------------------------------

There are no Trainers here, just head up the left or right road. If you hop
the ledges to get to the house, inside you will find two people. Talk to the
one on the left, and you will get the CLEANSE TAG. Now hop off the ledge,
go up and into CERULEAN CITY.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [131] ----------------------------

We're not actually doing anything here, yet. Exit the city to the east.

------------------------------- ROUTE 09 [132] -------------------------------

This place is full of ledges, and there are Trainers to fight. So, when you
see the first set of ledges, hop down twice, and grab the MAX POTION. Now

Go all the way left until you see a way to go up. Do so, then take a right,
then up the first stairway you come to, then up, and hop one ledge down. Now
go right, and into a field with a row of cuttable trees. There is a body of
water above you. There is a Pokemon Center in Route 10 to the south if you
need to heal up. When ready, SURF on this body of water.

The river is straightforward. Follow it as it flows downward.

------------------------------- ROUTE 10 [133] -------------------------------

Keep going downward. When you see a large building and fields of grass, hop
off onto the ground, and make your way inside the building.

----------------------------- POWER PLANT [134] ------------------------------

Inside, go up the stairs, and make your way to the back of the room. There is
one man facing the generator in the center of the room, with a Police man
behind him. Speak to him. Then the Police man behind him. Now head back to
the stairway. Another Police man will interrupt you, asking you for help.

There is a Pokemon trade in here, as well. A DUGTRIO for MAGNETON.

So, exit the Power Plant and FLY to CERULEAN CITY.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [135] ----------------------------

Go into the Gym! 

--------------------------- CERULEAN CITY GYM [136] --------------------------

The shady man with interesting way of speaking will run away soon after 
talking a little. Leave the Gym after him.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [137] ----------------------------

Go up and exit the city north, into Route 24.

He will see you, and dash between a couple. Talk to him, and get ready to
fight!

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [139] ----------------------------

Head for the Gym. No need to heal up, but do so if you wish.

--------------------------- CERULEAN CITY GYM [140] --------------------------

In the Gym, Go right, and go to right side, then up to the top of the Gym,
past the platforms. Then go left, so you are at the top left corner of the
Gym. Now, go to the inflatable tube (the red/white objects), and examine the
right side, facing downward, right next to the pool.

You should find the MACHINE PART. Now leave the Gym.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [141] ----------------------------

We need to head back to the Power Plant. So exit the city right, again, into
Route 09.

------------------------------- ROUTE 09 [142] -------------------------------

Make your way to the right side of the Route again, going up and down ledges.
When you get there, SURF on the water, and follow it down into Route 10.

------------------------------- ROUTE 10 [143] -------------------------------

Hop off on the first chance you get, and enter the Power Plant.

----------------------------- POWER PLANT [144] ------------------------------

Go speak to the Manager. The generator will run again, and you will receive
TM57 CHARGE BEAM as a reward. We can now get a RADIO CARD, as well as the
TRAIN PASS, that will allow you to travel between GOLDENROD CITY and SAFFRON
CITY by train.

Exit and FLY to LAVENDER TOWN.

---------------------------- LAVENDER TOWN [145] -----------------------------

Go to the Radio Tower. Inside, talk to the President, the Gentleman standing
next to the bench along the top wall. He will thank you and give you an EXPN
CARD.

Now exit and FLY to SAFFRON CITY.

------------------------------ SAFFRON CITY [146] ----------------------------

Remember Copycat? We have to visit her. Go to the house in the top right
part of the city, south of the Train Station (It's a blue house.)

Go inside, and upstairs, and speak to her. Now exit and FLY to VERMILLION 
CITY.

------------------------------ VERMILION CITY [147] --------------------------

Remember the fanclub? We have to go there and speak to somebody. So, go
to the club house, north of the Gym. Talk to the person next to the table.

You will receive the LOST ITEM. Now exit, and you will bump into someone else.
He will tell you about LATIAS [HEARTGOLD] and LATIOS [SOULSILVER], and he
will be important for filling out your Pokedex. As far as the walkthrough is
concerned, we won't see him much. You can find him in SILPH CO.

Now FLY to SAFFRON CITY.

------------------------------ SAFFRON CITY [148] ----------------------------

Go back to Copycat, and give her the doll. You will receive the PASS. Now
you can travel easily between Johto and Kanto.

Let's go and (finally) get the next badge! FLY to CERULEAN CITY.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [149] ----------------------------

Actually, we still have to do a bit more before the Gym fight. Heal up, and
head north into Route 24.

------------------------------- ROUTE 24 [150] -------------------------------

Head across the bridge, and it will take you into Route 25.

Anyway, go up the stairway on the right, to see two people. One will run away.
The girl stays, it turns out to be the Gym Leader Misty. She heads back to the
Gym now, so we can battle her.

FLY back to CERULEAN CITY.

----------------------------- CERULEAN CITY [152] ----------------------------

Heal up at the Pokemon Center. Prepare yourself for a Gym Battle. When ready,
head for the Gym.

--------------------------- CERULEAN CITY GYM [153] --------------------------

The Tips man doesn't say much. But she uses water, if you couldn't tell. Go
up and fight the first sailor:

That's it for the Trainers. Now SURF to the top of the lane, and get off, go
up the steps to fight Misty.

You should heal if needed. Get ready to fight!

Tips: Against Water, Grass and Electric is always nice to have. QUAGSIRE is
Ground as well, however, it has Water Absorb, so it may not be a good idea
to attack it with another water Pokemon. Electric would be bad too, as it is
immune to most of the attacks. A good tactic would be to allow QUAGSIRE to use
Rain Dance if any of your Pokemon have Thunder, this way the accuracy will
be raised, and you can take out the LAPRAS and STARMIE right after.
LAPRAS has Ice Beam, which can damage Grass easily. STARMIE follows up, but is
also part Psychic, so other methods can be used to deal with it. Be careful of
the movesets and abilities!

As you can see... there is a SNORLAX in the way. So, open your PokeGear, go
to your radio, and manually tune it to the center line, and go up. "PokeFlute"

cover Route 11 here, but if you want to skip it, just go down to the next
section which is DIGLETT's CAVE.

So head right along the path in the grass, and you will run into:

Go down the ladder right in front of you.

B1F:

Follow the path, as it is pretty linear. Keep the DOWSING MCHN out to find
useful items. We can't fully explore the area as we lack ROCK CLIMB, so for
now I will just take you to the other side. For full info on this cave, see
the exploration section.

At the end there is a ladder, take it to go up.

1F:

Go up the set of stairs to the left, and out the exit.

----------------------------- SEAFOAM ISLANDS [165] --------------------------

1F:

Go up the ladder.

--------------------------- SEAFOAM ISLANDS GYM [166] ------------------------

Go forward, and talk to the Tips man. The Gym is full of fire users, so water
and ground would work nicely. Go forward and talk to the scientist:

 -ARCANINE LV 50 (M) 2281 EXP
  -Type: Fire

Head right. Heal up if you need to, and get ready to battle!:

Tips: He uses all Fire type. All weak to water and ground. MAGMAR and
RAPIDASH have high speed, so be wary when they use Overheat on their first
move, as their White Herb restores their status drop. You can get rid of it
quickly if you have a Pokemon with Intimidate, which will force them to use
the White Herb first. MAGCARGO and MAGMAR also have anti-air moves, so be
wary of this. The fight isn't too difficult otherwise.

----------------------------- PEWTER CITY [171] ------------------------------

Heal up. Near the Poke Mart, there is an old man standing on an elevated
platform. Speak to him, and he will give you the SILVER WING [HEARTGOLD], or
RAINBOW WING [SOULSILVER]. This allows you to catch the other version's mascot
Pokemon.

There are two apricorn trees at the top right of the city. Grab them, they are
BLU and WHT APRICORNS.

There is the Museum at the top, where you can ressurrect fossils to get
Pokemon if you need to.

Anyway, when the tour is done, go to the GYM.

--------------------------- PEWTER CITY GYM [172] ----------------------------

This Gym is straightforward. Everyone uses Rock pokemon, so Ground, Fighting,
Grass, Water, Steel are nice Pokemon to have. High special attack would be
nice too.

The Trainers are skippable too, but assuming you're fighting them:

CAMPER JERRY (800P)

 -RHYDON LV 50 (M) 2185 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground
  -Moves:
   Rock Slide [Rock/Physical]

And the Hiker:

HIKER EDWIN (1600P)

 -GOLEM LV 50 (M) 1896 EXP
  -Type: Rock/Ground
  -Moves:
   Sandstorm [Ground/Status]
   Double Edge [Normal/Physical]

And that's it. Heal up if you need to, and get ready for battle with Brock!

Tips: They keep boasting high defense, by try to sweep aside their weakness
to several different types and especially low special defense. This fight is
really easy if you use special attacks with weaknesses. Also, don't be
afraid to use physical attacks coming from Pokemon with high attack. Moves
like Earthquake still destroy him, even if it seems like they have high
defense. Just look out for some moves, such as Rock Slide if you're using
GYARADOS or AERODACTYL, and Giga Drain if you're using Water. Things like
that.

****************************** CHAPTER 19 [CH19] *****************************

This chapter navigates MT. SILVER to reach the Legendary Trainer RED.

------------------------------- ROUTE 26 [179] -------------------------------

Enter the RECEPTION GATE, right above you.

---------------------------- RECEPTION GATE [180] ----------------------------

If you came from Route 22, you will come in from the right side. If you came
in from Route 26, then from the bottom side. Either way, exit to the left!

------------------------------- ROUTE 28 [181] -------------------------------

Head left, through patches of grass. Go across the top, and when you reach a
fork, go down, then left, and up a stairway.

Continue left, going down under the ledge, to see another stairway, go up
this one as well.

------------------------------ MT. SILVER [182] ------------------------------

Go up, there is a Pokemon Center here for your convenience. If you have a
Pokemon with CUT, then go down the stairway to the right, CUT the tree, and
enter the house. Inside, talk to the girl, you will get TM47 STEEL WING.

Exit the house, continue right, and pick up TM35 FLAMETHROWER. Now head back
up the stairway to Mt. Silver.

Now go south, down the left stairway, SURF across the water, go across the
grass, and up where the item is. Pick up the REAPER CLOTH.

Now go back to the Pokemon Center. When you are prepared to enter, hop the
ledge to the left, and go into the cave.

--------------------------- MT. SILVER CAVE [183] ----------------------------

Entrance, Inside:

Just so you know, Legendary Pokemon MOLTRES resides in here, too. But we are
not going for it right now, check the Legendary Pokemon sidequests for where
and how to get to Moltres.

Anyway, go to the rocky wall on the right, and use ROCK CLIMB to go up. Exit
out the exit on the right.

Outside:

Go down, pick up the ESCAPE ROPE. Go down, then go up the stairs to the left,
and go up the second stairway too. Go up, and go up the first stairway you
come to. Go down, and grab TM76 STEALTH ROCK. Now go back up, and at the top
of this path is a stairway going down. Go down. If you go inside that cave
entrance, you can get a FULL RESTORE, but that's it. Go down the next flight
of stairs near the one you just came down. Then go down, and down another
flight of stairs. Then go downward, and up the first stairway. Enter the
cave entrance here.

Inside:

Follow the linear path as it winds, eventually leading you upward. Go up the
large stairway you come across, and go to through the top.

Go forward, and up the stairway, go left, and up that stairway too. Go left,
and down, then right, and then up. Don't go up the stairs yet, go left and
grab the MAX ELIXIR. Now go up that stairway.

Go right, then down, then left, then up, and there is a stairway. Grab the
MAX REVIVE to the right first, though. Then go up that stairs.

Go left, then down. Smash the rocks, then keep going down, then right. Grab
the CALCIUM. Backtrack to the stairway, and go right, and out the exit at the
top.

Outside:

Go right, then down. Enter the cave and grab a PROTEIN, then go back out. Go
down, then enter the second cave entrance.

Inside:

Go down, and out the only other exit.

Outside:

Go downward, then left. There is an entrance, but first use ROCK CLIMB on
the left side. Go left again, and climb that wall too. Go right, and up, and
grab the PURE INCENSE. Now climb down twice, back to that entrance we crossed
earlier. Go inside.

Inside:

Go left, and out the only other exit.

Outside:

ROCK CLIMB on the wall right next to the entrance/exit. Then use ROCK CLIMB
on the rocky wall on the far left. Climb up the next slope to get the DAWN
STONE. Now go back down, twice, and take the middle path this time. Then
climb up again, and enter the cave.

Inside:

Go left, and climb up the only wall. There is one way out. Go.

****************************** CHAPTER 20 [CH20] *****************************

A chapter dedicated to the final battle!

--------------------------- MT. SILVER CAVE [184] ----------------------------

Peak:

Head forward, save, heal up, do what you need to do. When you are ready,
speak to him to begin!

Tips: Oh my. His levels are near 100, with all his Pokemon 80+. He has
devastating attacks and a good variety of Pokemon. You're going to have to
put everything you've learned to the test. You can win out in a battle of
endurance with enough REVIVE and FULL RESTORE/HYPER POTION. Also, the levels
shouldn't intimidate you, a well trained Pokemon with a well placed attack
will do him in. You can always go for Parish Song too, which came in handy,
or other guaranteed kill moves. It may take awhile, but the reward is well
worth it. Electricity packs a punch against Lapras, Charizard, and Blastoise.
Water takes out Charizard as well. Ground works only against Pikachu, but
Pikachu's defense is low enough for other Pokemon to take it out. You have
fought one of each of these Pokemon before, just combine the knowledge of
what you have learned. His harder-hitting moves will run out of PP quickly,
especially if you have a Pokemon with Pressure as an ability, or if you
keep using Spite. Status effects are key to winning as well, confusion and
paralysis making a huge difference to the flow of battle. Make sure if he
is in the yellow, you take him out quick before he uses a FULL RESTORE. It
is also Hailing, which damages his (and your) Pokemon slightly at the end of
each turn. This is good and bad. His Lapras is immune, however, so be
prepared. Good luck!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ END NOTES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[END]

Thank you very much for using this Walkthrough. There are so many better ones,
yet for some reason you are reading this one. I put a lot of work into my
first full length walkthrough, and I hope it paid off. The rest of the
sections of this FAQ will be coming in due time, but the main feature is done
here and now. It's great to see I can help people out when they need it, gives
a good feeling, as I think all FAQ writes can agree to. :)

I hope you stick around long enough to see the updates I will be doing. That
is, the completion of the SIDEQUESTS, the LOCATIONS, the TRAINERS, and all
the wonderful EXTRAS that come with this long game.

You may have completed the main Journey, but to fill the Pokedex and get the
most out of the game, well, you may or may not have long ways to go! I hope
you check back for future sections that I hope will help you out.

Best of luck, and thank you.

CATCHING LEGENDARIES [LGN]

==============================================================================

Below are the list of non-event Legendaries to catch in this game. They are
listed in National Dex order.

To ease your search, simply type their name in all caps between [ and ] to
find it with ease below.

Note that any Legendary Pokemon not on this list cannot be caught in this 
game (by normal means). Some may be avaliable through events, however. But the
list below displays the ones that can be caught in-game without outside game
requirements.

    -#144 Articuno [ARTICUNO]
    -#145 Zapdos   [ZAPDOS]
    -#146 Moltres  [MOLTRES]
    -#150 Mewtwo   [MEWTWO]
    -#243 Raikou   [RAIKOU]
    -#244 Entei    [ENTEI]
    -#245 Suicune  [SUICUNE]
    -#249 Lugia    [LUGIA]
    -#250 Ho-Oh    [HO-OH]
    -#380 Latias   [LATIAS]
    -#381 Latios   [LATIOS]
    -#382 Kyogre   [KYOGRE]
    -#383 Groudon  [GROUDON]
    -#384 Rayquaza [RAYQUAZA]

In this game, if you defeat a Legendary Pokemon (that is, you faint it), you 
are actually able to try again. You do this by defeating the Elite Four and 
the Champion once again, and the Pokemon will come back. You can try again 
with this. Some re-appear in different areas, and that will be noted down.

IV/EV/Natures all change each time you knock the Pokemon out. This is useful
if you are the type who wants something specific.

There are some general strategies that will be repeated said, so I hope you
don't mind reptition!

With each section, I will be using simillar formats:

Where: Where this Pokemon is located

Requirements: If there are any requirements for this Legendary to appear

Walkthrough: How to get to the Pokemon. It will be a somewhat thorough guide,
in the sense it will cover any Trainers that you fight, as well as how to
get to the Pokemon itself. It will not, however, include wild Pokemon
encounters. Note that the walkthroughs are not full cave explorations, but
take you straight to the Legendary Pokemon. Items grabbed are usually not
off the path, and are not found using the Dowsing Machine. For that info, look
at the Cave Exploration section in the FAQ.

HM: The HM's you need.

The Pokemon Itself: Below the Pokemon's stats will be displayed =

[VERSION] - If it is version specific. If it appears in both with different
            stats, it will be noted.

### POKEMON NAME LV ## <National Dex number and Pokemon name, and Level>
    -Ability: The Ability
    -Type: The Type of Pokemon, usually dual
    -Moves: The moveset
     Move 1 [Type/Type] PP <The Move name, Type of move, and whether it is
                            special or physical or status, and the PP per
                            move>

Tips: Any tips there are regarding the Pokemon and capturing it. This section
may be repetitive and state common knowledge, however.

********************************** ARTICUNO **********************************

[ARTICUNO]

Where: Seafoam Islands, which is within Route 20. There are two ways to enter
       the Island, one from the Fuchsia side (right), and Cinnabar side
       (left).

Requirements: *Reach SEAFOAM ISLANDS

WALKTHROUGH: Starts from SEAFOAM ISLAND CAVE, the entrance closer to the
             Cinnabar side. You get here by surfing east from Cinnabar Island.

HM: SURF, STRENGTH

------------------------------- SEAFOAM ISLANDS ------------------------------

1F:

Go down the stairway, ignoring the ladder going up.

B1F:

Walk left and up, and use STRENGTH on the boulder. Do not push it up, rather,
push it to the left until it hits the wall (three times). Push the left of
two boulders above you up once, and then the remaining boulder left or right.

Go left and up the stairway, grab the ICE HEAL, then go left and down the
ladder.

B2F:

Go onto the ice to the left, simply go under and slide up, or just slide left
and up. The top left corner icicle has a PEARL hidden on it.

Line yourself up with the Trainer you see standing there, and then slide right
into them:

SKIER CADY (1696P)

 -DELIBIRD LV 53 (F) 2077 EXP
  -Type: Ice/Flying

Now slide down, so you're against the bottom wall. Then go right, to the
Trainer sliding back and forth:

BOARDER SHAUN (1600P)

 -CLOYSTER LV 55 (M) 2392 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice

 -DEWGONG LV 50 (M) 1885 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice

Slide up, hitting the top wall, then slide down, hitting the bottom wall.
Slide right out of the ice.

Below is another sheet of ice. See that Trainer? Line up with him, then go
down, so you're standing right above him:

BOARDER BRYCE (1600P)

 -DEWGONG LV 55 (M) 2073 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice
  -Moves:
   Dive [Water/Physical]

 -LAPRAS LV 50 (M) 2346 EXP
  -Type: Water/Ice
  -Moves:
   Hydro Pump [Water/Special]
   Brine [Water/Special]

Slide directly to the right. Then, go down the ladder there.

B3F:

Head to the bottom left of the room, ignoring the left ice sheet near the
ladder you came from.

There is an ice sheet to the left with ice blocks on it. Push two of them out
of the way, either up, or down. Just not right or left. Then push whichever
one is remaining to the left (slide into it from the right). It will go left,
and then slide left again, and then go up, and left.

Go down the ladder that is in this new area, ignoring the ice sheet above you.

B4F:

Go down the stairs, and SURF on the water. Follow the slightly winding path
to a stairway above where you just were. Go up, then turn right, then down
those stairs, and SURF again.

Go down, right, and up the next stairway, then up the ladder near the stairs.

B3F:

Go up the only other ladder here.

B2F:

Go right, down, and cross the wooden bridge, taking you to yet another ladder.

B3F:

Go down the only other ladder here.

B4F:

Go down, and SURF on the water, go left, and then up, onto the stairway. You
are now face to face with Articuno. Save, prepare, and then push A on it to
begin! That is pretty much all of Seafoam. You can exit quickly by going to
the water, surfing, then going left, and up, then following the linear path
that takes you out, on the Fuchsia Side.

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #144 ARTICUNO LV 50
   -Ability: Pressure
   -Type:    Ice/Flying
   -Moves:
    Reflect      [Psychic/Status] 20/20
    Agility      [Psychic/Status] 30/30
    Ice Beam     [Ice/Special]    10/10
    AncientPower [Rock/Special]   05/05

Tips: Articuno has various weaknesses. Rock, Fire, Electric, etc. Be wary
      of that when doing your attacks. It has stat boosting moves, and only
      a total of 15 PP of offensive moves. Dusk Balls are your best bet for
      catching it, as the time of day does not matter within caves. Do the
      usual statis ailments/HP drain. If you KO it, it will be here again
      after you defeat the Champion.

*********************************** ZAPDOS ***********************************

[ZAPDOS]

Where: Outside the Power Plant. The Power Plant is located in Route 10, by
       surfing down the L-shaped body of water. Route 10 is easily accessed
       by leaving Cerulean City east and crossing Route 9.

Requirements: *Defeat BLUE at Viridian Gym; receiving the Earth Badge

WALKTHROUGH: None, as it's out in the open with no obstacles in the way.

HM: SURF (To reach the PowerPlant)

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #145 ZAPDOS LV 50
   -Ability: Pressure
   -Type:    Electric/Flying
   -Moves:
    Agility      [Psychic/Status]   30/30
    Charge       [Electric/Status]  20/20
    Discharge    [Electric/Special] 15/15
    AncientPower [Rock/Special]     05/05
    
Tips: Zapdos has two offensive moves, both of relatively low PP. The rest
      are stat boosters, which can keep it going for awhile, but gives you
      a lot of time to catch it. If you exhaust it of it's two offensive
      moves, you will have at least 50 turns to capture it, before it begins
      to succumb to Struggle. This is assuming you're not applying pressure.
      Try coming at night, so you can utilize Dusk Balls to capture the
      Pokemon; increasing your chances by a fairly large amount. There is no
      need to worry about it running away. Zapdos will appear again if you
      defeat it by accident/on purpose, after you defeat the Champion again.


*********************************** MOLTRES **********************************

[MOLTRES]

Where: Mt. Silver's interior. Specifically on the west side. You can access
       Mt. Silver by heading west from the Reception Gate, which takes you
       to Route 28, eventually to Mt. Silver. If you have been to Mt. Silver
       before, you can FLY there.

Requirements: *Defeat BLUE at Viridian Gym; receiving the Earth Badge
              *Gain access to Mt. Silver from Professor Oak

WALKTHROUGH: The Walkthrough starts from the entrance to Mt. Silver Cave.

HM Requirements: SURF, WATERFALL, ROCK CLIMB

------------------------------- MT. SILVER CAVE ------------------------------

1F:

Go left, and SURF on the water. Use WATERFALL on the waterfall that is above
you. 

2F:

Feel free to go up the stairway to the right and into the entrance to
grab the EXPERT BELT. Go back out and use SURF again if you did so.

Now surf left, up, and you can get off on the thin layer of ground against
the top wall. Use ROCK CLIMB on the climable wall to get up there.

3F:

Go left. If you examine that rock, you'll get an ULTRA BALL. Go up, then
climb down the next climbable wall that goes to the right.

2F:

SURF on the water there, and then use WATERFALL to go up.

3F:

Go forward, and up the stairway, through the only exit/opening there.

And there it is, if you ROCK CLIMB down either wall, you can fight it. From
the Pokemon Center outside Mt. Silver to here, it should take less than
250 steps, costing you only one MAX REPEL, if you were using one.

ROCK CLIMB down, and battle it!

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #146 MOLTRES LV 50
   -Ability: Pressure
   -Type:    Fire/Flying
   -Moves:
    Air Slash    [Flying/Special] 20/20
    Safeguard    [Normal/Status]  25/25
    Flamethrower [Fire/Special]   15/15
    AncientPower [Rock/Special]   05/05

Tips: It has more moves than Zapdos for offense, making it slightly more
      difficult. However, being in a cave, regardless of time of day, Dusk
      Balls should be very effective against it. Do the usual HP drain and
      status ailment, then start tossing away. If you defeat it by accident/
      on purpose, it will reappear here after defeating the Champion.

*********************************** MEWTWO ***********************************

[MEWTWO]

Where: Cerulean Cave. It is accessed by going to Route 25, then go south to
       the far left grass, taking you into Route 24, and SURF on the linear
       waterway, taking you to the cave entrance.

Requirements: *Defeat BLUE at Viridian City; receiving the Earth Badge

WALKTHROUGH: It will start from the Cerulean Cave entrance.

HM Requirements: SURF, STRENGTH, ROCK CLIMB, ROCK SMASH and FLASH (Not an HM, 
                 but cave is dark, and it would be very helpful).

-------------------------------- CERULEAN CAVE -------------------------------

1F:

Go up, and SURF on the water. Go straight up, then left.

Keep going left until it forces you to turn down. Go up the nearest stairway 
to the left, here. Grab the NUGGET, then go down the stairs below you, 
and past the rocks. Go up the stairway, and go right, and down, and right.

Ignore that ladder.

Go down the stairway to the left of the ladder, then up the next one. Go down,
down the next stairway, following the winding path, which will lead you to a 
larger stairway with a ladder at the top.

Go up this ladder.

2F:

Back here, slightly more maze like this time. Go up the first chance you get,
Then take the right, and follow the very long, yet linear, path to the end, 
where there is another ladder down a stairway. Go down.

1F:

Go to the only other ladder in this room.

B1F:

Go down the stairs, and follow the linear path as it winds. Take the first
right, and go up, grabbing the MAX REVIVE. Backtrack to the fork, then go
down, right, and follow this path, it will take you to a stairway that goes
into the water. SURF here.

Go right, then up, and you will run into land. Go straight up, up the stairs,
down the stairs on the right, and straight down you will run into more water.

Ignore the first right, and go down and to the right, grab the BLACK SLUDGE.
Now backtrack to the first right, and take it.

On land, go up the stairs, and there is Mewtwo. Save, prepare, and then
press A to get started! That's it for Cerulean Cave. The ladder behind Mewtwo
gives quick access to the exit.

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #150 MEWTWO LV 70
   -Ability: Pressure
   -Type:    Psychic
   -Moves:
    Psycho Cut [Psychic/Physical] 20/20
    Amnesia    [Psychic/Status]   20/20
    Power Swap [Psychic/Status]   10/10
    Guard Swap [Psychic/Status]   10/10

Tips: This is easier than it looks. Mewtwo in this game seems to have three
      status moves and just one offensive move, of which it has 20 uses. If
      you apply pressure, than it's just 10 turns of being under fire. Then
      you have 40 unpressured turns of capturing. Use Dusk Balls, as time of
      day does not matter within the cave. Do the usual HP reduction/status
      inflictment, this shouldn't be too hard.

******************************** RAIKOU/ENTEI ********************************

[RAIKOU] [ENTEI]

Like Latias/Latios, these two get their own section as they are almost the
same in terms of requirements and finding them. 

Where: Everywhere! These Pokemon roam around, going into different Routes as
soon as you do. You can check your PokeGear for their current location, to
see if they're in your area or not. I believe they stay within Johto routes,
only, however.

Requirements: *Complete the Burned Tower, so the Legendary Beasts scatter

 -Note: You will do this in the midst of the story

WALKTHROUGH: There is no walkthrough, as they can be anywhere. Instead, just
             follow the tips presented above to eventually find them.

HM: No HM requirements.

[HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]                  [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

#243 RAIKOU LV 40                       #244 ENTEI LV 40
-Ability: Pressure                      -Ability: Pressure
-Type:    Electric                      -Type: Fire
-Moves:                                 -Moves:
 Roar         [Normal/Status]     20/20  Roar         [Normal/Status]   20/20
 Quick Attack [Normal/Physical]   30/30  Fire Spin    [Fire/Special]    15/15
 Spark        [Electric/Physical] 20/20  Flamethrower [Fire/Special]    15/15
 Reflect      [Psychic/Status]    20/20  Stomp        [Normal/Physical] 20/20

A common tactic is to find two Routes that are connected without interruption,
and have fields of grass. You can keep moving back and forth between these
Routes, checking the grass and PokeGear to see if any are near you. This
way, you basically wait until they happen to be in the same Route as you.

Repel is a good way to keep wild Pokemon from getting in the way, as you
will only encounter the Legendary as a result--just watch out for it's level.

Once encountered, they will run on the first chance they get. For this, you
will have to keep them in the battle. Most people prefer to use Wobuffet;
due to it's ability that prevents Pokemon from escaping. However, the move
"Roar" can cause problems, as that in turn scares your Pokemon away anyway.

Any damage you cause will remain on that Pokemon. Any status ailment will
likewise. If they faint, then you can find them roaming again after you
defeat the Champion.

Fast Balls are a nice chance catch, as they are built mostly for this purpose.
You can get Fast Balls by presenting WHT APRICORNS to Kurt, in Azalea Town.

Raikou does not have much on the offensive side, as expected for a running
Pokemon. It has quick moves, all Physical, none Special.

Entei on the other hand has offensive moves, both Special and Physical. These
two points are points of caution.

It should not be too bad. You can try again if you mess up, after all.

********************************** SUICUNE ***********************************

[SUICUNE]

Where: Route 25, specifically Cerulean Cape. You can get there by exiting
       Cerulean City north, across Route 24, then east, through Route 25, past
       Bill's Cottage, and up the stairs.

       If you make it faint, it will reappear in the Burned Tower, located
       in Ecruteak City, after you defeat the Champion again.

Requirements: *Complete the Burned Tower, so the Legendary Beasts scatter
              *Encounter Suicune at Cianwood City
              *Encounter Suicune at Route 42
              *Encounter Suicune at Vermilion City
              *Encounter Suicune at Route 14

 -Note: The majority of these you will cross during the Pokemon League quest;
        that is, the story of the game. Route 14 is optional, but is the
        prime factor.

WALKTHROUGH: There is no Walkthrough required, as it is in an accessible area.

HM: No HM requirements.

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #245 SUICUNE LV 40
   -Ability: Pressure
   -Type:    Water
   -Moves:
    Rain Dance  [Water/Status]    05/05 
    Aurora Beam [Ice/Special]     20/20
    Gust        [Flying/Physical] 35/35
    Mist        [Water/Status]    30/30

Tips: Well, this battle can last quite awhile, seeing as it has a total of
55 PP for offensive moves. The lower level helps though, as by this point in
the game you are expected to have a much higher level, supposedly meaning
your Pokemon can take quite a few hits. Gust isn't particulary powerful,
either is Aurora Beam. Be sure to bring a Pokemon that is resistant, and
begin the process of bringing down the HP. Mist may present problems when it
comes to stats inflicting, and it's ability, in a drawn out battle, may cause
problems regarding your Pokemon and their PP. You could try this battle at
night time and use Dusk Balls, which would certainly help you out. Remember:
If you defeat it, it will reappear at Burned Tower after you fight the
Champion once again.

*********************************** LUGIA ************************************

[LUGIA]

Where: Whirl Islands, within Routes 41 and 40; east of Cianwood City and
       south of Olivine City.

Requirements:

HEARTGOLD: *Receive the Silver Wing from the man in Pewter City

SOULSILVER: *Receive the Silver Wing from the Radio Power president after you
             save it from Team Rocket
            *Acquire the last Johto Badge
            *Defeat the Kimono Girls to receive the Tidal Bell

 Note - In order to proceed in the story, you will have to have done this
        event anyway.

WALKTHROUGH: The walkthrough starts from Cianwood City to help you get to
             the correct entrance of Whirl Islands; as it has four entrances.
             The top right/northeast one is what we are aiming for.

HM: SURF, WHIRLPOOL, FLASH (Not an HM) would be helpful, as the cave is dark.

-------------------------------- CIANWOOD CITY -------------------------------

Go to the northern part of the city, face east, and SURF. We are aiming to
enter the WHIRL ISLANDS from the NORTHEAST (Top RIGHT) side. So we are looking
for the WHIRLPOOL closest to OLIVINE CITY.

----------------------------------- ROUTE 41 ---------------------------------

Basically, if you SURF from north CIANWOOD, skip the first WHIRLPOOL you see,
keep going right, then down, and it will be that one.

Once you cross over it, make your way into the entrance.

-------------------------------- WHIRL ISLANDS -------------------------------

1F:

Use FLASH to illuminate the cave. Now proceed forward and hop off the ledge.
The path splits in two, take the upper path, hop the ledge, go up, and go
down the ladder at the end of the passageway.

B1F:

Go down, and follow the linear path until you reach a ladder, go down this
ladder.

B2F:

Grab the MAX REVIVE to your left, then go down, and take the right path down.
You will see a man standing there. Speak to him!

He moves aside, now go down the series of ramps, ignoring the tunnel. There is
a cave entrance at the bottom of all the ramps. Enter it.

WATERFALL BASIN:

You will enter to see a scene with the Kimono Girls, they will briefly talk,
then begin a ceremony.

LUGIA will appear! Don't worry if you didn't save, you won't battle right
away. After she's done talking, I advise you save, and get ready to battle
LUGIA.

Go up to the water, SURF, head to the LUGIA, and press A to begin the battle!

[HO-OH]

Where: The Bell Tower. Accessible from Ecruteak City.

Requirements:

HEARTGOLD: *Receive the Rainbow Wing from the Radio Tower president after you

HM: No HM requirement.

--------------------------------- BELL TOWER ---------------------------------

1F:

Go left and up, toward a man standing next to a ladder. He will interrupt,
and will then let you through. Go up the ladder.

2F:

Another straightforward floor, go down and there is a ladder at the bottom. Go
up.

3F:

On this floor, you will notice ramps on the sides. You can only cross over
one-way. So first, go to the ramp to the left of you, facing left. Hop across
and get the FULL HEAL.

Now hop back using the ramp above that. Now go right and hop across that
ramp. Go up, and hop left across two ramps. Make your way around the central
pillar, and hop across two more ramps. Go up, and hop across three ramps going
to the right.

You can't see the ramp with the pillar in the way, go all the way up, touching
the wall, then go down one step, and then head right and you will hop across
a ramp. Now go down and hop across two more ramps. Go up the ladder.

4F:

There...are a lot of ramps in this room. I will just name the directions you
should hop to avoid confusion.

First, hop down, left, down, left, down, down, and grab the item to the right,
it's an ULTRA BALL. Now go right, down, left, down, down. You should be on a
platform with an item and a ladder. Grab the PP UP. This ladder serves no
purpose, so ignore it.

Go left, left, then up the platform. Now, hop left, left, left, down, right,
right, down, left, left, down, left, left. You should be at the bottom left
of the room, with another platform with an item and a ladder. Grab the
ESCAPE ROPE. This ladder, like the last one, is also a "return ladder." So
ignore it for now.

Go up this platform, and hop right twice. Go up again, and hop left twice.
There is another ladder. Go up this one.

5F:

If you want a RARE CANDY, then follow the directions below. It will cause you
to go down a floor and come back around, however. If you want to skip it, then
ignore the paragraph below.

Hop right twice, go all the way to the right side, then down a bit. Hop left
across twice, then down twice. You should be at the center of the room, grab
the RARE CANDY. Now hop right, then down, and go down the ladder. On the
fourth floor, follow the instructions from the bottom right ladder (the one
that serves no purpose) and make it back to the fifth floor.

Ignoring the RARE CANDY, or if you picked it up; follow below:

Hop right twice (from the starting ladder), then take the first hop down. Go
left, then hop left once, then down once. Take the left path, hopping down
twice. Then, take the right path, hopping downward four times.

Go up this ladder.

6F:

Go forward and pick up the MAX POTION. Then go right across a bridge, and up.
Ignore the first of the two bridges, and take the top one. Cross it, and grab
the FULL HEAL.

Now hop down twice and go up the ladder.

7F:

Woohoo, Warp Panels. These yellow squares warp you to a corresponding square
elsewhere.

Well, here's a brief side trip for you to take. Take the first warp panel you 
see, going up from the ladder.

Take the only other warp panel on this platform. Now go down.Hop in this
order:

(First) Left, left, left, down, left, left, and left. Warp at this panel.

Hop left, grab the NUGGET, hop right, warp.

Now hop left, down, down, right, right, and right. Warp at this panel.

Grab the MAX ELIXIR. Warp on the panel you came from. Now take four hops
right. Go up and warp at the only other panel. Then warp at the only other
panel here.

We should be back where we started. Hop right five times, grab the MAX
REVIVE. Hop down five times. Head left, and take remaining Warp panel.

8F:

Head down across the bridge, take the first warp panel. Grab the HP UP. Go to
the panel at the end of the area. Warp. Head up across the bridge. Ignore
the panel for a second, cross the bridge going left, grab the FULL RESTORE.

Now head back across the bridge and take the first warp panel you see. Take
this ladder you see, the only other thing on the platform.

9F:

Just one other ladder here. Go up!

10F:

Finally, the top! Go up, and a brief scene will commence involving the Kimono
Girls. HO-OH will appear!

You will have time to save after Zuki is done talking. Once she is, save, and
speak to HO-OH to begin the battle!

******************************** LATIAS/LATIOS *******************************

[LATIAS] [LATIOS]

Like Raikou and Entei, these two roam around. What separates them, however,
is that they are version exclusive. Latias appears in HeartGold, while Latios
appears in SoulSilver.

Where: Everywhere! These Pokemon roam around, going into different Routes as
soon as you do. You can check your PokeGear for their current location, to
see if they're in your area or not. I believe they stay within Kanto routes,
only, however.

Requirements: *Recover the Machine Part, and return it to the Power Plant
               to return the Power Plant to a functioning state
              *Talk to the Copycat girl in Saffron City
              *Receive the Poke Doll from the man inside the Pokemon Fan
               Club in Vermilion City
              *Run into Steven when coming out of the Pokemon Fanclub in
               Vermilion City

WALKTHROUGH: There is no walkthrough, as they can be anywhere. Instead, just
             follow the tips presented above to eventually find them.

HM: No HM requirements.

 Refresh      [Normal/Status]    20/20   Refresh      [Normal/Status]   20/20

A common tactic is to find two Routes that are connected without interruption,
and have fields of grass. You can keep moving back and forth between these
Routes, checking the grass and PokeGear to see if any are near you. This
way, you basically wait until they happen to be in the same Route as you.

Repel is a good way to keep wild Pokemon from getting in the way, as you
will only encounter the Legendary as a result--just watch out for it's level.

Once encountered, they will run on the first chance they get. For this, you
will have to keep them in the battle. Most people prefer to use Wobuffet;
due to it's ability that prevents Pokemon from escaping. They do not have a
move to scare your Pokemon, however, unlike the Legendary Beasts and Roar.

Any damage you cause will remain on that Pokemon. Any status ailment will
likewise. If they faint, then you can find them roaming again after you
defeat the Champion.

Fast Balls are a nice chance catch, as they are built mostly for this purpose.
You can get Fast Balls by presenting WHT APRICORNS to Kurt, in Azalea Town.

But if you're keeping them in the battle, then you can use the standard
Balls and try your best to catch them, lowering HP and giving Status
ailments. Their levels are relatively low, so this should allow for an easier
catch.

Refresh will heal them of status ailments, so you may have to be wary of
this. However, if put to Sleep, or constantly Paralyzed, then there is no
worry, as they will be unable to use it.

It should not be too bad. You can try again if you mess up, after all.

******************************** KYOGRE/GROUDON ******************************

[KYOGRE] [GROUDON]

These two are in the same place, the difference being they are version
exclusive. KYOGRE is for HEARTGOLD, GROUDON is for SOULSILVER.

Where: The Embedded Tower. It is within Route 47, which is west of Cianwood
       City, on your way to the Safari Zone.

Requirements: *Defeated RED atop Mt. Silver
              *Receive a starter Pokemon from Professor Oak
              *Visit Mr. Pokemon in Route 30 to receive the BLUE ORB and RED
               ORB [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

WALKTHROUGH: The walkthrough will actually start at Cianwood City, to guide
             you to the Embedded Tower.

HM Requirements: SURF, ROCK CLIMB

-------------------------------- CIANWOOD CITY -------------------------------

Head up, and left into the cave that leads to the Safari Zone.

------------------------------- CLIFF EDGE GATE ------------------------------

You will meet Chuck in here. He will talk a little bit, then leave. Leave to
Route 47 by going up the stairs, and following all the stairs up, and out
into Route 47.

---------------------------------- ROUTE 47 ----------------------------------

Go into the first entrance you come across, right past this Hiker.

1F:

Go down the ladder on the right.

B1F:

Go out the exit here.

---------------------------------- ROUTE 47 ----------------------------------

Face left, and SURF. Keep surfing left, past all the rocks, until you reach
a shore with a climbable wall on it. Use ROCK CLIMB twice, then enter the
cave entrance.

------------------------------- EMBEDDED TOWER -------------------------------

And there they are. KYOGRE if you're playing HEARTGOLD, and GROUDON if you're
playing SOUL SILVER. Go forward, and push A to begin.

*********************************** RAYQUAZA *********************************

[RAYQUAZA]

Where: The Embedded Tower, where Kyogre and Groudon are/were.

Requirements: *Capture Kyogre/Groudon
              *Trade in Kyogre/Groudon (whichever you don't have) from the
               other version. Has to be the opposite version, cannot be from
               previous games.
              *Put Kyogre and Groudon in your party, and visit Professor Oak
              *Receive the Jade Orb

WALKTHROUGH: It's the same as above, starts at Cianwood City. But to have
             gotten the Jade Orb, you would have to have been to the
             Embedded Tower already, meaning this does not require a
             walkthrough. If you forgot how you got there, then just read
             the walkthrough of the above section.

HM Requirements: SURF, ROCK CLIMB

   [HEARTGOLD/SOULSILVER]

   #384 RAYQUAZA LV 50
   -Ability: Air Lock
   -Type:    Dragon/Flying
   -Moves:
    Rest         [Normal/Status]   10/10
    Air Slash    [Flying/Special]  30/30
    AncientPower [Rock/Special]    05/05
    Outrage      [Dragon/Physical] 15/15

   Tips: So Air Lock prevents the effects of weather, in case you were
   wondering. It has a lot of offensive power, a total of 50 PP of offense,
   and 10 PP of status/HP healing. You could wait for it to sleep with Rest,
   but you would need to be able to take it's HP back down to near death
   in less than two turns to try the low HP + sleep trick. Once again, use
   Dusk Balls to capture it. You will need both good special and normal
   defense to last.

  want you to have this. TM89 contains U-turn. It lets your Pokemon attack,

 -"It's good of you to have come. Here in Ecruteak, Pokemon have long been
   revered. It's said that a rainbow-hued Pokemon will come down to appear
   before a truly powerful Trainer. I believed that tale, so I have secretly
   trained here all my life. As a result, I can now see what others cannot. I
   see a shadow of the person who will make the Pokemon appear. I believe that
   person is me! You're going to help me reach that level!"

   something more than that... So be it. This Badge is yours. By having the
   Fog Badge, Pokemon up to Lv. 50, including traded Pokemon, will obey you.
   Also, Pokemon will be able to use Surf. Here is another thing... I want
   you to have this, too. It's Shadow Ball. It causes damage and may reduce
   Special Defense. Use it if it appeals to you."

   Never mind. You should be strong enough to go across the sea. When you go

   Behind this Gym is a place called Dragon's Den. There is a small shrine
   at its heart. Go there. If you can prove that you've lost your lazy ideals,
   I will admit you are a Trainer worthy of a Gym Badge!"

   What? You passed?  That can't be! You're lying! Even I haven't been
   approved!"

   The Rising Badge will enable your Pokemon to use the move for climbing
   waterfalls. Also, all Pokemon will know you as a Trainer and obey your 
   every command without question."
 -"Wait! I'm sorry about this. Here, take this as my apology. That contains
   Dragon Pulse. Well, Dragon Pulse is kind of er... never mind! It's huge
   energy of some kind. If you don't want it, you don't have to take it. 
   What's the matter? If you are headed to the Pokemon League, go back to New
   Bark Town and Surf along Route 27. Your face...is telling me you have some
   unfinished business... Come on! Whatever you have to face from now, don't
   you dare give up! If you do, I'll feel even worse about having lost to you!
   Give it your all."

   I always welcome challengers! Hey! How about a Double Battle?"

   certainly one way to aim for the top... But that's not all there is to
   Pokemon battle. Although I don't feel it's necessary to remind you guys.
   See you, *TRAINER NAME,* another time!"

   not giving up beating you! I'll train my Pokemon and... my own heart, too.
   I'll come back as the toughest challenge for you!"

--------------------------- Spikey-Eared Pichu: [SEP] ------------------------

WHERE: ILEX FOREST [JL04]

HOW: Bring an EVENT PICHU to the ILEX SHRINE; it must be the party leader. (As
     in the one walking with you.)

WHAT: You get a Spikey-Eared Pichu! A special Pichu with one ear with multiple
      spikes on it. The special thing is the move set, as well as set gender
      and special sprite.

EVENT: (Below is the event dialogue)

---Start of Event---

<Examine Shrine>

<Pichu emerges from Shrine>

"It's a PICHU...! One of its ears is spiky!

<Plays with your Pichu, runs up the left L-shaped path>

<Old man then comes down the L-shaped path, two Pichu in front>

"Hey, hey! You should not tamper with that shrine! People are said to
 disappear."

<Old man looks over at shrine and back>

"Kids and Pokemon sometimes disappear around this shrine. It is believed that
 a Pokemon which wanders across time does that. It is truly a strange
 thing..."

<Old man looks at Pichu, looks back>

"Well, well, this must be... This must be the PICHU that has lived in this
 forest for some time. When I saw it the first time, it looked lonely. It is
 full of energy today."

<Two Pichu play more>

"I see. It seems that these old friends finally meet again after a long time."

<Pichu hops more, getting attention of the TRAINER. TRAINER moves to look at
 Spikey-Eared Pichu>

<It wants to join your party. Let it join you!>

"Zapzap chu!"

<If party is full>

"You are carrying a lot of Pokemon. Why don't you store one of them at the
 Pokemon Center? I will take care of it in the mean time."

<If you talk to Spikey-Eared Pichu with full party>

"Zapzap chu!"

"...Your party is full! First go store a Pokemon in a PC Box."

<If you talk to the Old Man after you freed up space that you did not have
 before>

"It's been waiting for you all this time. Talk to it. That'll make it happy."

<If you talk to Spikey-Eared Pichu after freeing up space in party>

"Zapzap chu!"

"Oh, here it is! Young Pokemon Trainer, I will give you this Poke Ball. I used
 to use them when I was younger. Don't worry. It's still in good condition.

<Trainer receives Poke Ball>

"It seems that Spikey-eared PICHU wants to stay in your Poke Ball."

<Spikey-eared Pichu has joined your party!>

<Choice to Nickname it>

"You named it *Insert what name you named it*? Such a cute name! Being with
 friends should make it happy. Take good care of it."

<Old Man leaves>

to get more background on it. Experiment, have fun. :)

CLOSING/CREDITS/CONTACT INFORMATION [CCC]

==============================================================================

This is my first full length Pokemon FAQ. You will have noticed that I am more
of an in-depth FAQ maker if you checked my profile. However, the original
games that these two games (HeartGold and SoulSilver) are based off of were
one of my favorite games of all time, and I felt I should at least pay my
respects this way.

Although I own the Japanese version of the game, I decided I would base the
FAQ off of the US releases, as it would hold more relevancy. :) All names
and other information used are from the US version of the game.

I hope you found this FAQ hopeful, despite the constant updates and time it
will need.

The mini-sections are currently being done. I removed the incomplete sections
to avoid clutter and make your scrolling easier. They will come as soon as
they're ready! Please stick around for that, if you need to.

If you find any errors, even as small as a typo, please email me! The address
is shown below. Also, if you find missing info (Like some Pokemon moves in
my Trainers' section, or missing amount of EXP), please tell me!

If you would like to help, that would be nice too! Email me if you're
interested. It will mostly be things regarding experience points and Pokemon
Moves and the like. :) I will be sure to credit you!

Please, if you want to use any information in your own guide (or some other
circumstance), please email me. I will gladly accept, but it's nice to ask,
you know? :) I put a lot of hard work into this guide.

If you usually come back and use this guide, please tell me why. I would like
to know what may make this guide good, and at the same time what makes it
bad. The other guides are of much higher quality (the way I see it), so it
would be helpful to know! :)

And yes, that top logo did take me forever.

Thanks for reading, cheers!

CREDITS:

Thanks to the Pokemon Company for this awesome game, the remake of the my two
favorite Pokemon titles!

Thanks to gameFAQs for the easy submission process!

Thanks to user pizzaman123 for the wonderful help recently in collecting
additional Trainer data that I may have missed or had incorrect! Also for
pointing out some mistakes here and there in the Walkthrough. I really
appreciate the help!

Thanks to you, the reader, for making my hard work worthwhile! I know you read
this in every FAQ, but it shows those of us who make FAQs really appreciate it
:) You see this in every FAQ, but that's because it's true!

CONTACT:

Email me at: mkaykitkats@live.com

I read all emails, and respond if necessary. :)

==============================================================================

HOW CAN YOU HELP? [HLP]

==============================================================================

As you can see, the FAQ is still a work in progress, and while I try my best,
I make a lot of mistakes and overshoot some details.

What I ask is simple: If you find mistakes in Rewards, Pokemon Levels,
movesets, move types, etc, or any other error, please, please, email me at
mkaykitkats@live.com.

Also, if there is anything that can make this guide better (Add/Remove
sections), please, tell me.

If you find any mini-section helpful, and find others not-too-helpful and/or
useless, please tell me too, as I am constantly reshaping the guide to be
easy to read and don't want needless clutter.

Also, for anyone who chose TOTODILE or CHIKORITA as their starters, it would
be nice to note down the EXP gained when fighting the RIVAL, as I cannot
write that down as I can't fight him with certain Pokemon for obvious reasons.

If anyone is planning on a re-play, I would appreciate them writing down notes
on EUSINE and his events relating to SUICUNE as seen in the game. I want to
include the dialogue in the EVENTS section, but have already missed the first
few as I originally wasn't intending on doing so.

Lastly, for Trainers who call on the Pokegear, if you could write down their
conversations and resulting dialogue, that would be appreciated.

Please send me a username I can credit you as, I will be sure to give you
full credit on your work. :) Thanks! I really, really, appreciate it.
