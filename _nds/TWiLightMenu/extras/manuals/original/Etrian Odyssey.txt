1.Introduction....................[INRT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my Third FAQ I have made and it's also my third one for Etrian Odyssey.
Etrian Odyssey is my favourite DS game and I don't think it'll change until I 
get Etrian Odyssey 2!! Yes Etrian Odyssey 2 is announced!! Anyways this is my
first walkthrough. I am going to keep this guide very simple. By that I mean I
am very lazy and will only tell you the one way to go. I think Etrian Odyssey
should be a game you play by exploring but if you are really stuck use my FAQ.
If you need help on the quests, missions or bosses get out of this FAQ and go
to my other ones. If you have any questions or things you want to add feel free
to e-mail me. This account is specially made for my guides. It is not connected
to GameFAQs in any other way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Story...........................[STRY]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Story taken directly from the website**

In a vast and fertile land lies a small town known as Etria,a peacful village
taht became famous for a startling discovery. A crack in the Vast forest opened
at Etria's edge, leading downwards like a gaping maw. It all began there...

Those who hear rumors of the Labyrinth of Etria, whether old or young, began to
harbor dreams of exploring it.

Riches...fame...prestige...all that and one more thing, does the the Labyrinth
Promise:the true spirit of adventure, on the perilous edge of death.

Today like any other day in new Etria,a youth walks through the town gates.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Controls........................[CNTR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The controls in this game are very simple. You use the D-Pad to select options
and move in the dungeon. A is used to confirm options. B is to go back in
options Y is used to open the menu and X is used to zoom in and out of the the
map. L and R are used to scroll through the maps. The touch screen is used to 
create maps and most of the button controls. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.The Basics......................[BASC]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Etrian Odyssey you have to explore the Labyrinth and go further in. To make
this easier there is a map on the touch screen. There are several things that
you use to make your map.

Pencil:Used to draw walls.
Paintbrush:Used to draw ground.
Event:Used to mark events such as talking with a soldier.
Treasure:Used to mark where you found treasure
Item Point:Used to mark where you found an item point. (Very useful)
Monster:Used to mark where a FOE or Boss is. (Very useless, since they move)
Door:Used to mark where a door is

Put walls around it like this:
 _
|_|=Door I=Wall
  _
I|_|I

Never put walls on entrance or exit of door.

Pit:Used to mark where you can fall through
Warp:Used to mark elevators and Warp points
Stairs^:Used to mark where stairs to previous level are
Stairsv:Used to mark where the stairs to next level are
Memo:Used to put a message on a box. (Very Useful)

You can only have two icons per a square. One has to be a marking icon and the
other has to be a memo. To make a new icon just click and drag it on to the 
map. To delete an icon drag into the garbage can. Map making isn't that hard 
once you get used to it, you shouldn't have that much trouble.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Terms...........................[TRMS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my walkthrough I use terms to make it easiar for you (and me) to get through
the floor. Some examples are like "all the way" or "around the corner". I have
a list of my terms and thier meanings. If you see anything in the walkthrough
that is there but not in this list e-mail me. This is my e-mail:

contributer_hangid@hotmail.com

Around the corner
All the way
Compass directions
# Spaces
Ignore Passage
Turn around


Around the corner- This means when there is a "U" shaped type of formation in
the path it means to go from either side of the "U" shaped formation to the
other. Here is an ASCII picture showing it.

O=You X=Destination

|X|  |O|
|^|  |v|
|^|__|v|
|<<<<<<|

OR
______
<<<<<<|
    |^|
O>>>>>|


All the way- This means to go one from end of a passage all the way to the 
other end ignoring all passages. Sometimes I will say all the until _____. This
is a map showing it:

O=You X=Destination

_____________________________________________
O>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>X
_____________________________________________

Compass directions- On a compass you have eight different derections. I use 
these some times. North will always be the top. On the top of your map where 
you the gird numbers, that is north. This is the compass:

     N
  NW/ \NE
   W| |E
  SW\_/SE
     S

N=North
NE=North East
E=East
SE=South East
S=South
SW=South West
W=Wast
NW=North West

# spaces or steps- This means to go a number spaces. An example would be, go
right 5 spaces or steps. A space or step is moving one tile forward.

Ignore Passage-This simply means when you're walking to ignore the passage I am
talking about. I may tell you to ignore 1 or more passages depending on the 
situation. Some I tell you to ignore because they have no value and some I tell
you to ignore because they are for later.

Turn around-Simply turn around 180 degrees.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Part 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All floors will have the following setup:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor **...........................[FL**] [Floor title]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: 

Monsters on Floor: 

Secret Area Monsters: 

FOES: 

Bosses: 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you first start a new game you'll see a little text and then you go to the
Verda Plaza. The only thing you can go is the Explorer's Guild. When you get
there. He'll start talking to you and then you have to make a Guild name. I 
called mine Akatsuki. No I am not a naruto fan it was my sister's idea. Anyways
once you decide on a name you'll be given five options. First register five
recruits. The normal party is PLASM but I used LPDSM for both of my 
playthroughs. Once you're done leave you get to go to the plaza. For more 
imformation on it, go to the extra stuff. First thing things first go to The
Rooster Inn to save. Then go Radha Hall and go accept missions and accept
Adventurer's initiation. You'll get a map and then you finally enter the 
Forest.

Stratum 1 Emerald Grove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 01...........................[FL01] The first hope-filled step
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Treerat, Woodfly, Mole, Clawbug

The monsters here pose very little threat except the Clawbug. The only thing
wrong with the Clawbug is that he is resistent to physical attacks and he hits
somewhat hard. Otherwise the monsters are just basic begining monsters.

Monsters on Floor: Treerat,Woodfly,Mole,Clawbug

Secret area monsters: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Waspior, Spider, Sloth

Don't worry about these. They are for later in the game.

FOES:3 Ragelopes(in secret area)

Don't worry about these either, for they are also for later in the game.

Bosses:N/A

Take a few steps forward and it will say you can use skill points. For good
skill guides see the character specific stuff in the extras. Keep going 
straight until you meet with a knight. Ask him what he's doing here and then
he'll start saying you have to create a map of the floor. You'll be given a 
short lesson on how to make a map. You only have to make a map of the floor 
that's in the red box. First head all the way left and then all the way down. 
Remember to draw the walls along the way,the soldier is very picky.If you pick
up the boot moles will ambush you!!! The good thing is if you fight them you
get a whitestone which you can sell for $$$. If you're hurt you can go back 
to town and rest. If you do go back to town go to Shilleka's and sell any drops
you got. Selling stuff to her is the only way to get money other than quests
or missions. It is also the only place to get armour and weapons. To sell 
everything of one kind just press Y. If you have the need to buy stuff go 
ahead but watch your money. Anyways once your done that go back to intersection
where you met the knight only this time take the right passage.

When you go all the way right you can either go left or right. Just to let you
know you can hold A to make battles go faster. If you go left and keep going
on you come to a clearing with chests. This isn't part of the map that you 
have to draw but it has chests! The chests contain Medica II, 200 en and a
Scramasax. Remember if you need to go to town to rest do so. Also remember to
save a lot. A reminder is that Protectors always need to have a shield. So now
if you didn't go to town you should head south and then left on the first 
passage you see. If you came from town go to the top right corner of that large 
in the begining. Either way you end up on a cross road which ever way you took 
just take the other to fill in the map. At the cross road go to the rightmost
hallway and head down. You'll get a message about water. Drink it. Afterwards
head back to the cross road and head down the other hall way. Ignore the 
passage you see on the way and continue down. There's a dead end head back up
to the passage I told you to ignore.

You will now be at a four way intersection. Take the one that heads east. You
end up in a 3x3 room with sparkly stuff in the middle. This is an item point.
If one of your characters have the skill chop you can get items from here. For
a good strategy of how to abuse these go to the stratagies section. In the 
bottom left corner of this room you will find a secret passage. Once you go
through it, it will forever be open. This will grant you easiar access to this
floor. Almost all other floors have atleast one. Since your here you might want
to go back to town to rest and sell your drops. Note:Not all passages are two-
way some of them you can only go through one way.

Anyways head back to the intersection but this time go north. Go up two squares
and you come across a door with vines. This can only be opened by a violet key
that you find later on. Use the "Door" icon to mark that there's a door. 
Afterwards head south then right all the way ignoring the passage. At the dead
end you come across a event. If you eat the red fruit your team leader gets
10HP. Mark this is as an event and head back to the passage I told you to 
ignore. To the left there is a dead end map it and then head right. Go all the
way ignoring the passage. In the dead end pick up the rucksack for 100en. Head 
back to passage I told you to ignore. When you reach the end of the passage you
end up infront of a 3x3 room. If you rest you get jumped by venomflies not
recommended. Map the room with an item point. Once your done head back to the
knight if you mapped properly he will let you pass. Head back to Radha Hall to
report your results. Select report results and then adventurer's initiation.

Once you report the results you get 500en. Go rest at the Rooster Inn and save.
You'll have probably noticed that the inn price has gone up. This has happened
because your party has leveled up. Anyways head to Shilleka's good and talk to 
her. If you show her the letter she'll let you buy Warp Wires. ALWAYS HAVE A
MINIMUM OF THREE WARPWIRES. THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT DUE TO THE FACT THEY CAN
WARP YOU OUT OF THE LABYRINTH AT ANYTIME. That noted, buy three warpwires then
whatever you want. Leave and then head to the Golden Deer Pub. A lady named
Valerie will start talking to you about how you can accept quests. Quests are
very useful and you should always accept as many as you can. If you need help
on these refer to my Quests FAQ. When you complete a quest go to Report results
to beat and get your reward. After your done this you can head on to BF2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 02...........................[FL02] The verdant in-between
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMEMBER BRING WARP WIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

New monsters:Hare,Vemonfly,Fender

The Hares can hit moderately hard but are probably the weakest of the new 
monsters. The Vemonflies are VERY annoying. They have an attack called poison. 
Just by the name you can tell the effect. The poison hits for about 25 damage. 
For low HP characters this is a big problem. If your lucky, hopefully they will
miss or you can kill them fast enough. The fenders are probably the biggest of
the problems. They can hit very hard and have very high HP. It is recommended
to run away from them.

Monsters on Floor: Treerat, Woodfly, Mole, Clawbug, Hare, Vemonfly, Fender

Secret area monsters: N/A

FOES:3 Ragelopes,2 Kuyuthas

The FOES in this floor should be avoided like the plague. For those who don't 
know what a plague is well lets just say it kills a lot of people in a short
time. This, is excactly what the FOES do. Avoid them, as I say in the 
walkthrough. The Ragelopes have higher HP but hit less than Kuyuthas. They also
have way superior defense. The Kuyuthas are the opposite of the Ragelopes but 
they should both be avoided.

Bosses:None

The route to B2F is very simple.You can see the staircase in the top left part
of B1F's map. So head straight until you get to the 3x3 room and take a
right. Keep going around the corner until you get to the stairs. Since this is
an entirely new floor you have no part of the map drawn. First things first put
a "Stairs ^" icon behind you and put walls around it. Don't put walls on the 
front part, the part that you can see the actual stair case. Also don't forget
to paint it. Even though they are staris they are still considered floor. At 
the end of a floor before you go down put a "Stairs v" where the stairs are.
So now that you got new floor basics down lets move on shall we. If you find 
the monsters here hard don't be scared to go back and train a bit.

If you go to the end of this hallway there's an event that makes the first 
person in your party lose 5HP. Not a good idea to do that so lets take the 
other way. When you reach a wall you have a choice of going right or or left.
If you go right you'll meet a soldier. He will either sell you a Shortsword or
a Soma. This is a one time thing and you can only get one of them. The left 
skips the soldier and continues on. When you go a little further you see some
bars near your monster encounter thing-a-majig. This is a bar to show you how
near you are to a FOE. A FOE is a harder almost mini-boss like monster. They
are very strong and are not meant to be treated like normal enemies. FOES are
purple or red. Purple means they have a set path and take a step everytime you
do. Red FOES mean that they chase you down. On the first couple floor AVOID
ALL ANY FOES UNLESS I SAY SO!! When you go around the corner you see an orange
sphere. That my friend is the first FOE! You need to avoid it. Look at the map 
to know how to avoid it.

O=You +=FOE

          _
          O|
         |v|__
         |> __
         | |
         | |
         | |
         |+

You have to wait until the foe is at the bottom then make a run for it. When  
you go through the Z like passageway you come to a hallway. Keep going past the 
first passage and the second passage to the top. Down this hall way there is a
chest with a warpwire in it. Go back to the second passage. You can now go left
or right. There is nothing to the left so go to the right. Keep going until you
get to a three way intersection. If go right and around the corner you come at
a tree. If you eat the fruit the first person in your party will lose 10TP. So
just ignore that and go to the left. Around the corner there will be another 
FOE. Just wait until it turns around and then keep going until you get to the
passage. If you get into battle run away. You'll be at a three way intersection
again. Both ways go to the same place but for FOE avoiding reasons go right. If
you do go left you will see a passage. This leads to a Kuyutha FOE. At your 
level this will be too hard so leave it alone.

As you keep going fromt he right side you come a U shaped turn. In the middle
there is an intersection with a FOE. Around the corner there is a tree with 
fruit that restores 10HP to the first person in your party. Anyways go infront
of the intersection. You need to move back and forth to position the FOE. The
FOE must be here.

O=You +=FOE


      |+|
     _| |_
     O-> _
      |_|

Once you at this position run forward and then up. This will take you a down 
staircase. Mark it as a "Stairs v", put a floor on it and then go down. When
your at B3F it may be in your best interest to warp back to town. Everytime you
come at a new floor new quests open up at the pub. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 03...........................[FL03] Marble orchard of soldiers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters:Mandrake, Roller

The Mandrakes aren't that hard. If you have an Alchemest with fire the 
Mandrakes pose no threat. If you don't have an Alchemest thats Okay too because
they aren't that strong. The rollers however hit hard, are resistent to 
physical attacks and can use defend to raise thier defense. Like with the 
Mandrake an Alchemest is recommened.

Monsters on Floor: Treerat, Woodfly, Mole, Clawbug, Hare, Vemonfly, Mandrake, 
Roller

Secret Area Monsters:Sleepgel, Venomgel, Petaloid, Firebird, Scorpion

Don't worry about these. 

FOES:4 Stalkers,1 Kuyutha,5 Armoths(Secret Area) 

The Stalker should be avoided more than anything in the entire game. The one
Kuyutha you will have to fight to progress. By now your levels should be a 
little higher than when you were in B2F. Don't worry about the Armoths, for 
they are later in the game.

Bosses:Golem(Secret Area)

Don't worry about this guy, it's for later in the game.

Put an "Stairs ^" option behind you. Don't put a wall on the left side of the
staircase. When you come down you hear about how there will more active FOES.
FOES that appear as red will follow you. They don't have that much movement
but they will follow you. There is a red FOE in this giant room. To get past
him run all the way down until you're 1 space away from the wall. Then head 
right. There will be a door here put a door icon here and put walls only on the
side of it. When you go up this room you will see another FOE. This type of FOE
only chases after you when you're infront of it. The front is the way the
arrow is pointing. To avoid it you must do the following:

O=You X=FOE

 ______
 X O-> |
| |    |

 ______
   X O>|
| |    |

 ______
    X O|
| |   v|

 ______
 < ^ X |
  |---O|

After that head four spaces left,one up and then two left. When you do that you
will get past him. Head down until you see a door. When you get there you see
two girls. Thier names are Ren and Tlachtga. Say that you are adventurers. Ren
will then tell you that they are guarding the area and that you must head back 
to town. So you have to go back to town. Hopefully you brought a Warp wire to
get back to town faster. When you get back to town head to Radha Hall. When you
go, Quinn will start talking about how there are monsters prowling lower in
the labyrinth. Go accept the mission called "The terror of Fenrir". He'll start
talking about how there are wolves deeper in the Labyrinth. What you must you 
do is go to B5F and kill Fenrir. Before you head back to the Labyrinth, rest,
sell your drops, buy new equipment if wanted and save. When your done head back
to Ren and Tlachtga.

When you get there Ren will let you pass. Mark a door and then go through it.
You are now in a room with three doors. The top one leads to room with two 
Stalkers and a room with three chests. The chests contain 400en, Medica III and
a Hide Boot. This is not suggested due to the fact that the Stalkers will rape
you. The other rooms lead to the same thing but the lower is faster, so head to
that one. Go straight and then left. You come at an intersection, when you take
the left path you will come at a FOE that you will have to face. This is a
Kuyutha, this guy can hit VERY hard. I suggest you level up a little before you
face him. Also use as many skills as you can on him. As you go down the hallway
ignore the first passageway you see. Take the second one you see and go down 
until you see a door.Put a door icon and pass through.

When you enter this 3x3 room head to the door on the left. Look right and take
the passage way. Then go right ignoring the passage way and heading all the way
to the end. When you go further you'll see Ren. She will talk something about 
secret passages (these are explained earliar in the FAQ). Two spaces down the
hallway turn north and you'll see a "check" option. Press A and then continue
forward. From now on when you want to come back to the lower part of B3F take
this secret way. Now that you've got that settled head back to the 3x3 room.
This time take the door you didn't go through. You're now in a hallway that
has three doors. The one on the left has a chest with a Therica A in it. The 
one on the right has a "take item point". The one in the middle is the one you
need to take to advance. When you enter the room you hear a scream and are
offered to help a soldier. If you are near death don't. If you want to, go 
ahead. I didn't help the knight so I don't know what happens. When you don't
offer to help, Tlachtga shows up. She heals you. Every time you step on the
middle square of this room she heals you. Head through the door and head 
right. Mark the stairs and head down.

Floor 04..........................[FL04] The depths' black teeth
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Clawfly

The Clawfly is basically like the Clawbug except it's stronger, had more HP,
more defense and it's red. It also has the skill Whirr.

Monsters on Floor: Mole, Clawbug, Hare, Vemonfly, Fender, Mandrake, Roller,
Clawfly

Secret Area Monsters: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Fangleaf, Sloth, Maneater

Don't worry about these.

FOES:7 wolves, 3 cutters(secret area)

The wolves are pretty easy FOES. They don't have that great defense or HP. What
they do have is great experience. With Tlachtga near the end of B3F this is a
prime spot for training. Don't worry about the Cutters.

Bosses: N/A

When you take a few steps you hear screams and then FOES appear on your. B4F is
an excellent training floor. This is because the wolves are pretty easy and 
Tlachtga can heal you on B3F. You should go back to town and save if it's been
awhile. If you're there accept the new quests if you can. The thing about B4F
is that it has too many breakoff points. It's hard to tell you what to avoid so
instead I will tell you what to do in steps. North is going up in the map. 
East is going right on the map. South is going down on the map. West is going
left on the map. North is going up.

From the stairs take four steps right. Then eleven steps north. Two steps
east. Three steps north. Two steps east. Two steps north. You should now be at 
a door. It's not so complex here so I can explain normally. You should be in a 
2x4 room. Go right and around the corner. That little spot in the corner is
for nothing. Go up and take the first passage you see. Going all the way leads
to a dead-end. Go down the passage and then up. To your right is a dead-end to
the left is the place where you want to go. Go down ignoring the small little 
break off. There is weird circle type formation here. On the top left part of
is a door with an Amrita. Anyways head up from the door to get to the stairs.
What a short and easy floor!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 05..........................[FL05] Staring down the roar
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Warbull

The big problem with the Warbull is, that it can hit so hard it can OHKO people
with ease. They have more than 100 HP which can also cause problems. The good
thing is that it is very slow and probably will not get to you in time.

Monsters on Floor: Mole, Clawfly, Fender, Mandrake, Roller, Clawfly, Warbull

Secret Area Monsters: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Sloth, Waspior

Don't worry about these.

FOES: 4 wolves(3 in secret area), 7 skolls

The wolves should be no threat. The Skolls are just stronger versions of the
wolves. They chase but can be killed quite easy. They are located only in the
room where Fenrir is.

Bosses: Fenrir

Refer to my Boss FAQ.

This floor may seem long and complex but it really isn't. If you follow the 
directions properly it should be easy. Anyways head down until you get to a 
passage way. Go down and turn left. Take the first passageway you see go down. 
Go right all the way and then go down until you're at a four-way intersection.
Go down and then two steps right. From here go all the way down ignoring other
passages. Go one step right and then all the way down ignoring the passage.
There is a "chop" item point here. Moving on, go left all the way and then 
down. There should be a long passageway to your left. Go all the way down. From
here go up then right. There should be another long passage here. 

Go left and then up and then left again. When you down you'll notice a few 
things. Two doors on the side that both lead to item points. The upper item
point is a "chop" item point. The lower one contains a "mine" item point. 
Adjacent to the doors is a dead-end passage. If you don't want to get items 
just head down to the door. You'll be a room with some open space. In the
bottom right of the room there is a chest with a blaze oil in it. The door is
directly across. When you enter the door turn right and then go all the way up.
In the small little breakoff there is secret passage to the other parts of B5F.
You can you use this shortcut to get to Fenrir easily. Speaking of Fenrir go 
back down and then head the only way possible. When you enter the room you'll 
get a warning. Then all of a sudden FOES! Thousands of them!! Oh and along
with them are Fenrir. This is the boss of this stratum. For a good strategy
see my Boss FAQ. When you beat Fenrir all the FOES dissapear.

GO DOWN THE STAIRS AND THEN FORWARD!!!!! YOU'LL SEE REN AND THEN SHE'LL TELL
YOU ABOUT GEOMAGNETIC FIELDS. GO UP TO IT AND SELECT RETURN TO TOWN. NOW YOU 
CAN WARP TO THE SECOND STRATUM ANYTIME. W00T!!

Floor 06..........................[FL06] Dance of the fairies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Waspior, Spider, Sloth

New stratum, new really hard, really annoying monsters! The sleepgels and the
Venomgels are somewhat resistent to physical attacks. The Sleepgels can put one
of your party members to sleep. The Venomgels can poison you entire party and
the posion can hit for more than 30 damage.

The Waspiors have an attack that can hit you and then poison, but it doesn't 
always poison. The spiders are probably easiest of the new monsters. They don't
hit that hard nor do they have that good defense. The Sloth can hit very hard
and has quite a lot of HP. Should be avoided when you first come here.

Monsters on Floor: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Waspior, Spider, Sloth
                 
Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 6 Cutters, 3 Moas

The Cutters have a lot of HP. They also have VERY hard, so hard will probably
OHKO anyone in your party. They also have very long claws...not that it 
matters. The Moas can also hit hard but not as hard as the Cutters. They have
very good speed. Both of them should be avoided.

Bosses: N/A

The good thing is that B6F is a short floor if you my follow path.The bad 
thing is it that there are several new and very hard monsters. If you find the
monsters resistent use your special attacks. Remember if you're relatively 
close to the Geomagnetic Field go there instead of using a Warp Wire. Anyways
moving on. Go forward around the Geomagnetic Field and to the door. When you 
go through go through the door directly infront of you. There will be 3 FOES in
this room. Avoid them all costs. They are strong and have an abundant amount of
HP. If you had trouble with Fenrir these guys aren't the best things. Head all 
the way right and then all the way up. If you turn right you should see a door.
Enter it. Go all the way down and around, then all the way up and then finally,
go right until you get to a door. Beside it ia "mine" item point.

Go through the door and then around the tree in the middle. When you go down 
a FOE will appear. This is a Moa. Moas, like the cutters, should be avoided. 
Go through the door and you will see a fork in the road. Head to the one on the
right. Head all the way down to a door. It's too complex to say how to get past
these FOEs, but what you will have to do is get to the bottom of the room so 
the FOE guarding the room. Make your way to the door in the bottom left corner 
of the room. Head up and then left one space. Turn right and you will find a 
secret passage. This is great because it is really easy to access to get to the
next floor. Continue forward and then down. Go all the way right and then up to
the stairs. Mark it as a "stairs v" and then go down. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 07..........................[FL07] Trail of enduring pain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Fangleaf, Maneater

The Fangleaves and Maneaters are just palette swaps of each other. The Maneater
is the stronger one though. Neither of them pose much of a problem except that
they both have quite a bit of HP but they don't have that much defense.

Monsters on Floor: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Waspior, Sloth, Fangleaf, Maneater

Secret Area Monsters: Meltworm, Moriyana, Vampbat, Sworder, Redclaw

Don't worry about these.

FOES: 2 Assassins

If you follow my walkthrough you won't have to fight Assassins, but if somehow
you are caught here are some warnings. They have quite high attack and also 
has a posion that can hit for more than 100 damage. You probably won't be able 
to put that much damage on him. Thier speed as okay maybe a S or D may go
before him but other than that, no. You're better off running.

Bosses: Alraune (secret area)

For later in the game.

BRING A WARP WIRE FOR THIS FLOOR!!

First of all go back to town and to Radha Hall. Quinn will tell you about a
dragon in B8F. He says that they need the egg of the dragon for research. 
Accept the mission and then head out. Sell your stuff and check out the new 
quests. After that head back to B7F to continue on. When you head forward 
you'll see some red spiky vines on the floor. Every time you step on these
everyone in your party takes damage. You should check your HP everytime you
get past one of these fields.

Anyways on with the walkthrough. Go all the forward until you get to the first
damage spot. Go right to get a chain helm. Go left and around the tree until
you get to a wall. Head up and then right, then down, then left and then three
spaces up. You should now see two trees, one on you left and one on you right.
Go all the left up and then all the way up. You'll notice when you're going 
left that a chaser FOE. You should avoid this FOE. It's called an Assassin. 
It can hit hard and it's poison is not pushover either. Anyways when you get 
all the way up you'll see a chest, this chest contains something called a clear
key. This opens doors that a have a clear crystal and vines infront of it. Now
use your warp wire because you don't want to fight that Assassin and because
you can now get to areas you couldn't before.

-------------------This is where the back tracking starts----------------------

If you don't want to backtrack just skip this section, although it is highly 
recomended. Anyways head to B1F. Go all the way forward until you get to a 3x3
room. On the left part of this room is a door. Enter it, it contains a Nectar. 
Go back to the 3x3 room and then head to the intersection below. Take the
passage on the east side and go all the way across. Go all the way down until
you see a passage which should be in C4. Head 4 spaces down and turn left. You
should see a check option. This is a one way passage and there are stratum 2
monsters. As well as ragelopes.

If you go all the way forward it leads to a dead-end, so take the first passage
you see. As you go along this passage you will see three doors. They all have
a Ragelope gaurding it. The lower one contains 500en, the middle one contains
a Rapier, and the highest one contains a Medica II. When you are ready to
leave there is a door in the highest room. When you enter the door head right
and around the corner to get a plumed hat. After you have gotten that, go back
to the door. Go the other way, and head all the way down. Then go all the up,
then all the way left and then 8 spaces down. Turn right and you'll see a check
option. Select it and you're finally out.

For the next part you will need to go to B2F. When you get to B2F head to the 
first Ragelope. Beyond it is a another part of B2F. To get there you must 
defeat the Ragelope that is in the way. When you defeat head all the way down
and then all the right until you get to a passage. When you go in the passage
you will be at an intersection. Take the on on the left. You should see a clear
crystal door. There are two hallways, both containing chests the upper contains
a Medica IV, the lower one contains a Soma. 

When you have gotten those two items head back to the intersection. This time
take the other way. Go all the way straight and then down. You should be at an
intersection, head right all the way and then up one space. There are now two
ways you can go. Right or left, you'll end up in the same place. Although you
might want to go the way where you don't have to fight the Kuyutha. If you took
the upper one go straight then down, if you took the lower one just go 
straight all the way. The next part is just zig-zag formations until you get to
the Nectar. After you are done here head back to B7F

------------------------The walkthrough continues here-------------------------

Head back to those trees I mentioned before (the one where you saw them then 
had to go left). Go right through them and go all the way. Then go left and 
then and then all the way until you get to the first passage. Don't go any 
further because there is an Assassin that will chase you. Go all the way down
the passage and then left. Head all the way down past the damage field and down
to the bottom. At this intersection right lead to a dead and left is the way to
go. Go only three steps because when you turn right there is a shortcut. This
is probably the best shortcuts in the game.

Continue on past the secret passage and to the door at the end of the hallway.
Enter the door and head all the way and then left all the way and then all the
way down. When you go one space forward you will see a door. Within there will
be a waterfall type thing that heals you. Remember this place. Leave the room 
and then head left. Go all the way up and then all the way right to the stairs.
Put down a "Stairs v" icon and head down to B8F.

Floor 08..........................[FL08] The Wyvern's nest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Petaloid, Eviloid, Firebird, Scorpion

The Petaloids are complete bitches. They can put your entire party to sleep and
then hit hard to kill them off. They good thing is that they have a little over
a 100 HP. The Eviloid is a palette swap of the Petaloid but not as bad. Can hit
for okay damage but nothing really special.

The Firebirds are really resistent to fire, but you could have told that by the
name. They have bad defense, atleast in my opinion. Thier attack is nothing to
be scared of. The Scorpions are very strong. Not only can they hit hard but 
thier posion can hit for around 100HP. They have ok HP and ok defense. If you
can kill them fast enough they aren't much of a threat.

Monsters on Floor: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Spider, Fangleaf, Maneater, Petaloid,
Eviloid, Firebird, Scorpion

Secret Area Monsters: Vampbat, Sworder, Hexfrog, Cutcrab

Don't worry about these.

FOES: 2 Assassins, 3 Killclaws(secret area), 1 Armoth

The only new FOE is the Armoth. They have quite a lot of HP and can hit hard.
Thier defense isn't that great but it's not bad. Has a nice drop that can sell
for a lot of en. 

Bosses: Wyvern(before accepting The Dread Wyrm, Wyrm (after accepting The Dread
Wrym)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 09..........................[FL09] A labyrinth for monsters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Glowbird

Only one new guy. Nothing too special about him. Can hit above average. Has 
insanely high speed and I doubt anyone can go faster than him. Very weak 
against pierce attacks.

Monsters on Floor: Venomgel, Waspior, Sloth, Fangleaf, Petaloid, Eviloid,
Firebird, Glowbird

Secret Area Monsters: Hexfrog, Moriyana, Vampbat, Cutcrab, Sworder, Redclaw

Don't worry about these.

FOES: 1 Armoth, 2 Cutters, 1 Assassin, 8 Moas (5 in secret area)

Nothing new.

Bosses: N/A


Now you're probably confused as to why I seemed to have skipped B8F. Well I
didn't. B8F and B9F are interconnected, so thats why I am doing them both in 
one part. Even with the both of the floors combined they aren't too long or
hard.

When you come down to B8F new quests will open up. There is one called The
Explorers Guild Trial. The reason that I'm mentioning this quest is that you 
have to spend 5 days in B8F. If fight all 5 of the days you will probably be 
around level 30 by the end. Just something to keep in mind.

When you get down B8F go forward until you get to a passage. Go down it. There
are two doors here, one normal one and one purple crystal one. Enter the normal
one. When you go inside you will see Ren. She will say that this fountain is
being blocked by a monster higher up. Remember that room with that waterfall
and when you entered it you got a warning. Go back there to fight a Pondclaw.

The Pondclaw had quite a lot of defense and can raise it higher with Defend. 
Just use all your skills and hopefully you have Defender or Immunize. When you
defeat him go back to the fountain and it will be working. Everytime you come 
down to B8F going here is recommended. 

Go back to the stairs and head the other way. Keep going until get to a 
passage. When you go a few steps you will get a warning and then you'll see a
FOE pop up. That, is the Wyvern. The Dragon egg right behind it. If its 
pointing towards you it will star chasing you. Move until it turns left or 
right and then go the way it's not looking. Get the egg and get the hell out
of there. 

Go back to Radha Hall. Report your results and then there will be a lot of 
talking. When it's done head back to B8F. In the south-east part of the 
Wyvern's room is a secret passage. Wait until thw Wyvern is facing west and
then head for it. Make your way up the passage and then around the corner.
Go forward, put down a "stairs v" icon and then head down.

When you get to B9F head to back Radha Hall. Quinn will talk about some monster
in B10F. A new mission will then open up. It's called "The hunt for Cernunos",
go accept it. Rest, buy/sell items, check new quests and then head back to B9F
to continue.

Take one step forward and then head all the way left and then around the corner
to get a Medica III. Go back around the corner and get to the first damage
title. Then head down and then head one step right and go in the little spot.
Head all the way down and then all the way left. 

To your left is a dead-end so go right. Go all the way down the passage. When
you go half-way down a FOE will pop-up behind you. Just keep going and don't 
look back, don't look back. When you get all the way down go right. Here there
will be two cutters. The stairs are at the top of this room. They move in 
circles so watch thier patterns and head for the top.

When you go down put a "stairs v" icon behind you. The path here is laid out.
Just keep following the green squares with a red thing on them. The red things
are not the damage tiles. Or you could just move in a "S" shape formation.
Anyways when you to end the end put a "stairs v" icon. In the north-west part
of this room there is secret passage, open it up before you go.

When you get down out a "stairs^" icon beside you. Go a little forward and then
turn right. Go forward then turn right again and go forward. Now turn left and
go forward a bit then turn right and go forward. Finally turn left and go 
forward. Turn left and then head down this corridor. 

To your left is a dead-end. Go all the way right (theres a Nectar surrrounded
by damage tiles on the way) until you get to a passage. Head up the passage,
turn right and then go forward. Turn left and go forward. To the right is a
dead end so go left. Put a "stairs^" icon and then go up.

Put a "stairs v" icon behind you. Take one step forward and then turn left. Go
forward two steps and go down the passage to your right. When you go down this
the FOE you saw earliar will star chasing you. Go up this passage four steps
and then turn right to find a secret passage. Hopefully you activated the well
so can rest here.

If the FOE is blocking you way back the area you were before, go up to B7F and
then come back to B8F. Anyways starting from the shortcut, head all the way 
north and then all the way left. Then go around the corner and then all the
way west. Then go all the way down and turn left and go down the stairs. Go
all the way right and then all the way left and then down the stairs to B10F.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 10..........................[FL10] The forests' silent king
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Stingmaw, Sprout

Stingmaws look like Fenrir but they are weaker. There's nothing really special
about them. They do't have a lot of HP or ATK or DEF. Sprouts are really rare
monsters. They drop S leafs that make a really good item. They can only be
found at E4.
 
Monsters on Floor: Sleepgel, Venomgel, Waspior, Petaloid, Eviloid, Scorpion,
Stingmaw, Sprout

Secret Area Monsters: Woodbat, Vampbat

Don't worry about these.

FOES: 1 Assassin, 5 Armoths, 2 Moas

Once again no new FOES. By now you should be atleast be able to put up a fight
against them.

Bosses: Cernunos, Wyvern (is moved here after accepting The Dread Wyrm)

See my Boss FAQ for help Cernunos. Just remember to not kill both of his 
allies. Wyvern moves to B6 and replaces an Armoth.

When you get down put a "stairs ^" icon behind you. Then go through the door
to your left. Nothing special here, just go through the door straight ahead.
When go through the door there'll be a door directly infront of you, you know
what to do, go through it.

You should be in a 3x3 room. There's ANOTHER door in this room. It's located
on the right side, enter the door. To your right will be a dead end so go all 
the way left to find another door(who would've thought?). In this 3x3 room take
the door see when you enter the door. It's in the southeast part of the room.

Take on step forward to find a door, take another step forward and you find 
nothing. When you enter the door...a FOE!!!! You have to fight it. It's just a 
Moa, easy peasy. Just bombard it with skills and remember to heal. When you
kill go through the door it was blocking.

There will be a "Take" item point in the middle of this 3x3 room. Go through
the door to your left to proceed. Turn left to see another frikin' door. Going
all the way will lead to a dead-end, but that's easy to see. Go through the
door.

When you enter the door you'll find another 3x3 room (what a boring floor). 
Going through the door straight ahead will lead to a pathway with item points,
FOEs, en and items at the end. However, that is not the door to go through.
Instead go through the door to your left.

Go through the door...suddenly FOES thousands of them!! Actually there are only
4 of them and the are Armoths. Just make your way to the northwest part of the
room. If you get into a fight you can fight them or run. If you want to make it
easiar just run.

When you get to the northwest part go up the hall way. The door on the right
leads to another FOE, so take the door on the left. In this 3x3 room take the 
only door possible, it's to your right. To your left is a dead end. Go all the
way right.

When you get to the end turn right and go all the way, it's a long way. When 
you get there turn right and go all the way. It's not as long as the other two.
When you get to the end of this passage turn right and go 4 spaces up. Turn
left to find a secret passage. This good because it's near Cernunos.

Anyways, go north all the way from the secret passage. Turm right and go 
forward. When you come a across a break off point go all the way down. You 
should get a message, so you shouldn't miss it. When you're there you'll will
see a talk option. Talk to Ren Tlatchtga to get your HP healed everytime you
come here until you beat Cernunos. You'll also get an Amrita II.

Go back to the hallway and then go east until you get a break off point. Go all
they way down then turn left and go all the way left. Turn left and then go all
the way. Then turn left AGAIN and go all the way. When you finally get there
you will get a message. Cernunos is right behind this door. When you beat him
go to the south east part of this room to go down to B11F.

REMEMBER TO GO TO DOWN TO B11F AND GO ACTIVATE THE GEOMAGNETIC ROOM. IT'S JUST
AROUND THE CORNER IN A DOOR.

Floor 11..........................[FL11] A mysterious cerulean wood
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Treefrog, Madworm, Guardant, Deathant

New stratum means a lot of new monsters. The Treefrogs are nothing. You could
probably kill them in one shot. They have an ability that allows them to summon
another Treefrog to battle. That not necassairly a bad thing (see strategies
section). I don't know what's wrong with the Madworm but it has really bad
defense. Perhaps it was meant to be like I don't know, but it sucks.

The Guardants and Deathant are not that hard but can still cause troubles. They
can hit between 60-80 damage. If they're hitting quite higher than that there
may be a problem. If they're alone or with another enemy( other than another
ant) they won't be able to decimate your party.

Monsters on Floor: Treefrog, Madworm, Guardant, Deathant

Secret Area Monsters: Woodbat, Meltworm, Moriyana, Redclaw

These guys are on the next couple of floors.

FOES: 5 Sheltors, 3 Bloodants, 2 Muckdiles (secret area)

The Sheltors can cause a lot of trouble. For one they have have relatively high
HP. With that HP count they also have pretty high defense. They can hit 
moderately hard but no so hard they can OHKO. The Bloodants are just like the
other ants except they have increased defense. 

Bosses: N/A

The third stratum besides being shiny is one of the more complax floors. I'm
not saying it's extremly hard but it's annoying. However, it does contain my
favourite and hands down the easiest floor to beat and map, B15F. When you get
down there you'll see what I mean. 

Put a "stairs ^" when you get down. When you first get down walk straight
forward then go a little right until you see a door. When you go through the
door there will be a Geomagnetic Field. Head back up to the town and to Radha
Hall. Quinn will talk about new the stratum blah blah blah accept the mission
to map B11F and B12F. Remember on B1F you had to map it, same thing here except
you have to map everything except the secret area parts.

You have to step on every tile in order to beat this mission. Don't forget to 
put walls when mapping. When you get down walk around the Geomagnetic Field and
then hade out the door (don't forget to map the door. When you go through the
door head all the way right and then all the way right again ignoring the 
passage.

Head back to passage I told you to ignore. When you get there you will see a
soldier. He'll say that they tried to map the floor but they suck and they 
failed. He'll give you crappy not done map, I don't like it. Change the walls
like I have it. Take away the walls on the Gemagnetic field.

Anyways take a step forward and then go all the way right. Turn left and take
a step forward and put a wall. Go back a space and then turn left and go all
the way ignoring that passage (why would want to go to an old area anyways?).
When you get there turn left and go all the way down ignoring the passage. 
Remember this passage though.

When you gone all the way down erase the wall and put a "stairs v" icon. Don't
go down just yet. Head back to the passage I told you to ignore. You should now
be at 4 way crossroad including the way you came from. First head south all the
way. There's nothing of here but intrest except half way through there is 
short-cut that can only be opened from the other side.

Head back up to the crossroad but this time head north. Ignore the door and 
head all the way up. Nothing here either. Now go back down but this time go in
the door. Go up a space and there will be chest with a Medica IV inside. Mark
the chest and go back to the crossroad.

Now to head the only new way, east. Go all the way east and then all the way
north. You can now go either right or left, go right go all the way. Then go 
all the way north. Then go back to place where you could either go right or
left, take the left way now.

Take the first passage you see and go up it.  Go right, go
all the way right. Turn left and go all the way up and ignore the passage, but
remember it. Then turn left again and go all the way until you see a door. When
you go inside, you see Ren! She will talk about warriors from far away and then
you get to enlist Ronins. 

Now go back to that passage earliar I told you to ignore. Go all the way down
it and turn right and go all the way ignoring the passage. You'll see another
soldier who'll give you another crappy map piece of a map. Now go back to the
ignored passage. Take a step left and then go south and enter the first passage
you come across, not the one you come from the one after that.

Go down it and then go back to the entrance of this passage and then head all 
the way south. Then turn left and then go all the way and remember to draw the 
walls that the lazy soldier didn't draw. Anyways turn one step to your left and 
then go right all the way.

Then go all the way north and then all the way left ignoring the passage but
remember it. Go in the small little part at the end and then go back to the
passage you ignored. By the way, when going through this next part there will
probaly be a Sheltor unless you've already faced it when you went in that small
hole.

Now go up the passage and then around the corner and then all the way. Then go
north all the way. Now you can either go left or right. Head right first all 
the way. There is a "mine" item point here. Now head in the oppsoite direction.
Go all the way and into the door.

When you enter the door you will see a strange purple spot on the floor. This 
is a pit. Pits drop you down to the next floor. Pits are not very good, atleast
not this one, right now. Instead remember that way you went right and then up
to get Ronins head back to that place. It's 5 paragraphs up.

Now when you're back here (B3) head left then all the way up. Head left all the
way. Turn right and go infront of the door. Now turn around 180 degrees and go
all the way. Turn right and you should see a passage. Hopefully you won't get
caught by the Sheltor and the sheltor coming up.

Go in the passage and go the way that the FOE will not come into contact with
you. When you get to the other side go in the door open the chest that contains 
700en and then walk around the room. When you're done here leave this room and
make sure that the FOE won't get in your way. When you leave go the way that 
you didn't take before. 

Do the same thing in the next part going the way you didn't go before. Now go
go forward but not into that part where the Ronin door is. Go south and then
left until you get to the first passage. This place should be familiar. Go down
the passage and go all the way then turn right and go around the corner.

Now head south ignoring the first passage. Turn right and go all the way down
the passage. If you're doing the quest Remembering the Fallen there's something
here for it. Now go back to the ignored passage. Go down it all the way 
ignoring the passage to meet another soldier.

He'll give you a map...a very pathectic map! Now go back to the ignored passage
and go all the up it ignoring the passage (a lot ignoring thos floor). It's
just a dead-end so go back to the ignored passage. Go all the way ignoring
this passage.

Turn left and go all the way. Now turn left and go all the way then turn right 
and go all the way. (If there is a FOE just walk back and forth in the previous
area.)  Now turn right again and go to the door. The soldier made this room 
very wierd. Erase the wall where the door is supposed to go. There is nothing
in here, so leave.

There should passage right infront of you, go in it. First turn right and go 
all the way. Then go in the small little alcove. Then go back to the place
where you could left or right go left instead of right. Go all the way then go 
a step right then turn left and go all the way.

Ignore all the doors on your way. Enter the last door, it's along the wall.
Go inside and take a step forward, turn right and open the secret passage. Now
go back to the door that had that one tile square. Go in the small room leave
and go all the way left. 

Take a step back and head north ignoring the passage. Just walk along this top
part of this room and then head back to the ignored passage. Go down the
passage. Turn left and go around the corner ignoring the door. There is "mine"
item point here.

Now head back to that door from before. Go in it and walk around. Then head
back to that place where you could left or right. Head right this time. 
You should now hae gotten the message that you have mapped B11F. If you do not
the get map for any wall mistakes.

Floor 12..........................[FL12] The insect queens palace
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Hexfrog

The hexfrogs look like the treefrogs except the can curse. What curse does is
when someone attacks the enemy you take some damage. For your hard hitters like
Landsknetchs this can be big problem. Just kill them before they can do a lot
of damage from that.

Monsters on Floor: Treefrog, Hexfrog, Madworm, Deathant, Hexfrog

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 3 Servants, 11 Bloodants

The Gaurdants and Bloodants are very mean. They can hit hard and can stand for 
awhile. The good thing is that most Bloodants can be automatically killed by
killing the Servant in that area. Some can be automatically killed by killing
Royalant. There's only one lonely bastard that can't be killed like that.

Bosses: Royalant

Her FOEs will keep responding until you kill her.

When you get down put a "stairs v" icon behind you. Go forward all the way. 
Half way there will be a passage ignore it and keep going but remember it. At
the end of the long hallway there will a chest with a Medica III in it. Now go
back to the ignored passage.

You can either go left or right. Go right first. Go all the way and then turn 
left and go forward. There's a shortcut on the other side of this wall. Go back
to the place where you could left or right. Head left this time. Head forward
and then go the first passage, nothing here. Continue along the passage.

There will be another breakoff, go down it. Nothing here either so just keep 
going along the passage. At the end of this passage you can either go left or
right, go left first. Go all the way, there's nothing here so turn around and
go all the way. 

Turn left and go all the way. Now turn right and go all the way. Well you're
probaly thinking where to go next? There's no other place to go in this area.
This problem can be fixed though (it's much of a problem anyways...). Go to the
D3 area of B11F. If you opened the short cut this will be much easiar. 

You will see four doors along this area. Take the door in the middle left. 
There will be a Bloodant in this corridor. Kill it and go fall in the pit.
When you fall down open the short-cut right in-front of you. Now go back 
and go forward all the way. Remember this from after you go left.

Turn left and go all the way around the corner ignoring the door. Nothing here,
go back to that ignored door. Kill the Bloodant in this room. Walk in all the
spaces in this room. In the south east part of this room there is a Gum Helm.
In the north west part of this room there is a Bravant. 

In the north east part of this room there is a door. Enter it. There will be 
nothing here. Now go back to that first two way passage when you first fell 
down the pit. This time head the other way. Go all the way then go all the way
north ignoring the passage. Nothing here so go back to the ignored passage.

Now you can either go left or right. Go left and go around the corner. You will
run into a Bloodant (which respawns until you kill the servant) on the way.
When you around the corner you will come across the Servant you want to kill.
Kill it and then head back to the two passage.

This time head the other way. Go all the way ignoring the passage. Nothing here
so go into that ignored passage. Go down it then turn right and go all the way.
Go right all the way, nothing here so turn around and go all the way. Now head
all the way ignoring the door near the end. 

Nothing here so go back to the door. When you enter the door just head north
until you get to the Servant. You'll probably run into a Bloodant or two on the
way. Now walk around this room and make sure to walk everywhere. You should
have 3, 2 space walls at the end. Now head to the north west part of this room
to proceed. 

Go around the corner when you get there and then go around the corner again.
Now you will either be able to go right or left, go right. Go all the way and
then turn right and go all the way and then go in the small little hole at the
end. Head back to the place where you could go left or right.

Head the other way now. Head north and go into the first passage you see. Just
keep going and going until you get to the Servant. Kill it and then walk around
the room. When you're done you should four 1 space squares. Go to south west
part of this room and enter this door.

There will be an Amrita II in this room. Leave this room and go back to the 
begining of the passage that led you this room. Head north and go down the 
passage. Go all the way down. Open the shortcut right in front of. Then turn
to your right to open the passage to Royalant.

When you kill her walk around the room. If you didn't get the message go down
the stairs located on the south part of this room and then come back up. Return
to Radha Hall and report your results. Then head back to this room and head 
down the stairs to get to B13F.

Floor 13..........................[FL13] The soldiers' washbasin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Woodbat, Vampbat, Meltworm, Moriyana, Redclaw

The woodbats have a fair amount of HP and defense. Try using pierce attacks
on them. The Vampbats also have an attack that can drain your HP. The meltworms
are just like the Madworms. Just use normal attacks and they should go down in
a shot or two.

There's nothing special about he Moriyanas. They have pretty much average 
stats. They shouldn't couse that much trouble. The Redclaws can hit really 
hard. Their other stats aren't something to worry about. If you do get into a
battle with them, go after them first.

Monsters on Floor: Treefrog, Madworm, Hexfrog, Woodbat, Vampbat, Meltworm, 
Moriyana, Redclaw

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 5 Killclaws, 3 Muckdiles

The Killclaws will only spawn when you get into a battle near them. They have
very high defense. They can also hit very hard. There's nothing much else to
them. Try using elemental attacks. There are only five so there isn't a high
chance that will come into contact with you.

Bosses: N/A

When you get down put a "stairs ^" up icon behind you. Go forward all the way.
Go all the way right ignore the passage and keep going. Turn right and get the
treasure chest that contains a Medica III. Go back to the ignored passage. Go
down the passage and into the door. There will be a water well here. Head back
to the three way passage when you got here.

This time go other the other. Go all the way. Turn left and go all the way 
ignoring the passage. A Killclaw will appear along this passage. Now turn left 
and go all the way. Turn left, go all the way and then turn right all the way.
Now go around the corner and go all the way forward.

Turn left and go all the way and then turn right and go all the way. Turn left
and go all the way then turn and go all the way. Then turn left go down, turn
left again and go all the way until you get to a passage. Go all the way up 
this passage. 

Take a step to the left and then head all the way north. To your left is secret
passage. Open it, go back through and go all the way until you get to the first
passage. Go down the passage and then go all the way left. Turn right and go 
forward until you get to the passage.

Take two steps to the left and then head all the way south. Then go all the way
east. Then finally go all the way north to get to the stairs that leas to B14F.
That was a quite short but boring as well. The follwing floors are pretty short
too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 14..........................[FL14] The flood of gods' tear
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Cutcrab, Sworder

The cutcrab has very high defense. They are just like the Killclaws except
weaker. The sworders can hit for okay damage. If you want to get rid of them
really try using pierce attacks like Trueshot or Drain. Pierce attacks are
their worst enemies.

Monsters on Floor: Hexfrog, Woodbat, Moriyana, Vampbat, Cutcrab, Sworder, 
Redclaw

Secret Area Monsters: N/A 

FOES: 5 Killclaws, 1 Muckdile

Bosses: N/A

On B14F there are flower pads that help you cross the vast amounts of water on
this floor. There isn't a lot of land so it's rather easy to map. Put a 
"stairs ^" icon behind you when you get down. Go all the way forward turn left
and go all the way until you see the first flower pad.

Ride the flower. You'll land an island that looks like a + sign. Go forward and 
ride the flower. Take one step to the north and then one step to the west. Ride
the flower here. Now go all the way north then go all the west then go all the
way south. Ride the flower. 

Head all the way west, one step south and the all the way west again. Ride the
flower. Head all the way east and then all the way north. Ride the flower. Just
walk forward and take the flower. Go south until you get to a passage, go 
through to get to a set of stairs. Go up them.

You're now back to B13F. You're here to get something very important. Go
forward and then go left all the way. Turn left and go all the way, then turn
right and go all the way. Go right all the way and then go left until you get
to a passage. Go down the passage and go all the way left. In the chest there
will be Violet key, you can now open purple doors.

--------------------------Backtracking starts here-----------------------------

For the first part of this backtracking go B1F (it's been a long time). Take 
the short cut right at the begining. Go forward all the way then take a step 
north. Go all the way down this passage. Go a step south and then go east until
you get to four way passage. Go north into the purple door.

In the east part of this room there will be a Nectar II and a Gem Staff. For 
the next part go to B8F. Go in the door right infront of the Well. In this room
the items are 500en ,1000 en, 1500en, Medica V, Nectar II, Hamao and Moccasins.
That's the end head back to B14F

--------------------------Backtracking ends here-------------------------------

Go back to the island that looked like a + sign. Once again ride the flower on
the east part. Go south all the way and then east all the way. You meet some
weird girl. She says something about not going any further and some other stuff
and then leaves.

Go south and then one step east. Get the Medica III in the chest and then ride
the flower. Ride the flower directly infront of you. Go all the way east and
ride the flower. Now go north and ride the flower. Go forward a step and north
a step, ride the flower. 

Take a step south and then take a step west, ride the flower. In the south west
part of this room there will be the stairs to B15F. You're almost to the end
of the third stratum, good for you!!

New monsters: N/A

Monsters on Floor: Moriyana, Cutcrab, Redclaw

Secret Area Monsters: Flamerat, Goldeer, Mantis, Sabremaw, Hexroot, Immoa

Don' worry about these.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 16..........................[FL16] The pathless drifting sand
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Flamerat, Goldeer, Mantis, Sabremaw, Immoa

The flamerats are probably the weakest of the new enemies. They have average
stats but can be killed by a few shots. Their attack is okay but not so strong
that they can OHKO. The goldeer have above average stats. They can hit 
moderatly strong but like the flamerat not enough to OHKO.

The mantis is probably the biggest worry of the floor. Not only does is it
resistant to physical attacks but it can hit high. It should be your priority
to kill in battle. The sabremaws look like Fenrir but don't reflect his
difficulty.

They can hit moderatly hard and have okay defence but nothing really special.
Although you should watch out for that Coldfang of his. The Immoa has nothing
really special. He neer really uses Stunner and has rather weak defence.

Monsters on Floor: Flamerat, Goldeer, Mantis, Sabremaw, Immoa

Secret Area Monsters: Darkhare, Maul, Burstgel

Don't woory about these.

FOES: 10 Sickwoods (5 secret area)

The sickwoods are of rather little threat. They almost never attack and when
they do it doesn't do much. All they do is spam thier poison. Just have a medic
use Refrsh every turn and have you fighters attac him. Defender and Immunize
aren't necasairy.

Bosses: N/A

On B16F there are these things called sand conveyor belts. These conveyor belts
automatically move you from one place to another. This is actually a good thing
because they don't count as steps so the chances of getting into a fight are
lessened.

When you get down put a "stairs ^" icon behind you. Head left until you get to
a door. When you enter it you will see your first conveyor belt. When you get
off the sand belt go on the one directly infront of you. When you get of this
one go on the one right infront of you.

Head right all the way and get on the belt. When you get off, take step to the
right turn left on go on the belt. Go left all the way and get on the belt. 
Now turn right and go on this belt. Turn left and take the belt. Turn left 
and take this belt (almost there). 

Turn right and go forward. You will meet up with Tlachtga. She will start
talking and she'll give you a Hex Bell. With this you can now register Hexers.
Anyways go forward then then turn right and go all the way. Turn right again 
and go all the way.

You will get a message about how you can't go further and how there seems to be
a place for a tablet. Head back to Radha. There will be some talking and then
you will get the tablet. Had back to the plce where you needed to put the 
tablet. Put it in open the passage and then go down the stairs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 17..........................[FL17] Doorway into the Unknown
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Hexroot

The hexroot much like the other monsters so far don't pose much of a threat.
They can hit average and don't have a lot of Defence or Hp on them. You should
be able to kill them before they use Scream.

Monsters on Floor: Flamerat, Goldeer, Mantis, Sabremaw, Immoa, Hexroot

Secret Area Monsters: Burstgel, Direwolf, Clawlord, Silker 

FOES: 3 Sickwoods, 3 Kingdiles(secret area), 3 Desoulers(secret area),
3 Dinolich (secret area)

Sickwoods are old and all the other FOEs are in the secret area.

Bosses: Manticor (secret area)

This is in the secret area of this floor and for the later part of the game.


When you get down put a "stairs ^" behind you. Go all the forward and you will 
see that forest folk girl again. There will be a lot of talking and then she'll
run away. Go all the way right and then all the way right again. Turn right and
go through the secret passage.

Turn right and go 3 steps forward. Turn left and open the secret passage. Take 
a step forward and turn left and go 3 steps forward. Turn right and open the
secret passage. Turn right and go all the way forward. Turn left and go 
through the secret passage.

Turn left and go all the way forward. Turn right and go through the secret
pasasage. Turn left and go all the way forward. Turn left and go through the
secret passage. Turn left take a step forward and go through the secret 
passage.

Take 5 steps forward and there will be two passage. Take 4 more steps and open
go through the passage to your left. Go down the stairs. Take a few steps 
forward a message will say you need to go back to Radha. Go back to Radha there
will talking then head back to B18F.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 18..........................[FL18] 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Soldier, Mystic, Pixie, Warrior, Druid

Well, here come the forest folk. All the new enemies are part of the Forest
Folk infantry. The soldier have a fair amount of HP. Although they have wooden
sticks as weapons they can still hit quite hard. The mystic uses magic instead
of attacking. Watch out for it's Voltshot and hope it doesn't use Salve.

The Warriors look like the soldiers but they have claw things as weapons. They
have more HP and hit way higher than the soldiers. The Druids are like the 
Mystics except they have Ice shot, Barrier and Blaze. You should watch out for
Iceshot and Blaze. Pixies just status magic like Petrify, Slumber and Shine.

Monsters on Floor: Soldier, Mystic, Mantis, Sabremaw, Pixie, Warrior, Druid,
Immoa, Hexroot

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 2 Cruellas, 1 Diabolix, 1 Bud

The Cruellas are the weaker version of Diabolix's. They still have quite a lot
of HP, defense and attack. They also have an attack called Siren. This annoying
attack has a chance of confusing your entire party.

The Diabolixes are just the stronger version on the Cruella except they can
have an attack that has a chance of cursing your entire party. Curse makes the
person who attacks the enemy take damage. The Bud is a weak enemy that warps
around and doesn't attack in battle. It also has very bad stats except HP.

Bosses: N/A

When you come down you will see Ren and she will start talking. After she's 
done talking head all the way west until you're one space away from the wall.
Then head all the way south. You'll get a message about some passage. Take a 
step west, take a step south, face the wall with the green plant and go 
through the passage.

Go three spaces north, two spaces west and turn right and face the Diabolix.
After you kill the Diabolix go all the way forward and go through the passage. 
Go all the way right, then turn left and go 7 steps forward. Turn right and 
open the passage.

Go back through the passage and go all the way right. Now go all the way left
and then go all the way left. Go all the way right and then go all the way
right. Put a "stairs \/" icon infront of you. Go down the stairs and get ready
for B19F.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 19..........................[FL19] An excursian into Despair
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Faerie, Redbeak

The pixies are stronger version of Pixies. They are not that great in stats
but can can blind and terrify your entire party. The Redbeaks are very first
they can even go faster than Survivilists. They can hit moderatly high but
nothing else except they are weak to pierce attacks.

Monsters on Floor: Pixie, Hexroot, Warrior, Druid, Faerie, Redbeak, Immoa

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 1 Sickwood, 1 Cruella, 3 Diabolixes

All old FOEs.

Bosses: N/A

On B19F to get to the next area you must take warp points. B19F is similar to
B14F if it helps. It's a very short floor like B14F as well. When you get down
go all the way forward turn left and go through the warp (I don't know why it
looks like a bush).

Turn left and go all the way then turn left again and go through the warp.
Turn left and go all the way forward and then turn right and go all the way 
right. Now go through the warp to your right. Take a step forward, go all the
way left and go through the warp.

Go all the way forward and go through the warp. Turn left and go all the way
forward and turn left again and go forward. Go through the warp. Go all the way
then go all the way left, all the way right, all the way right again, left all
the way and go through the warp on your right. 

Go all the way right and enter the warp to the right. You'll now be on a place
that looks like a + sign. Go through the warp on the east side. Turn right and
go around the corner and go through the warp. Go all the way west ignoring the
passage then go through the warp. You will come across a Diabolix on the way.

Go all the way forward ignoring the passage and go through the warp. You will
come across another Diabolix on the way. Go all the way forward and then go all
the way left. Enter the warp turn left and go forward. Enter the warp. When you
take a step forward you will get a message about a lot of Forest Folk.

Go all the way forward then go all the way left. Open the secret passage, you 
will be back at the begining. Go back through passage. The stairs to B20F is in
the south west part of this room. Kill the Cruella and Diabolix and go down the
stairs.

New monsters: N/A

Monsters on Floor: N/A

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 4 Diabolixes, 4 Cruellas, 2 Hunters, 4 Ogres

The hunters have good defense but not as good as hunters. They can hit 
moderately high with physical attacks. The main thing you should watch out
for is his Blaze attack. He has a somewhat high HP but not so much that it 
will be hard to kill.

The Ogres have really high defense and attack. Not only can they hit hard but
they have an attack that can increase their attack. They also have a lot of HP
on them. It would be in your best intrest to kill the other FOEs around them
before facing them.

Bosses: Iwaopeln

Iwaopeln will not die until all other FOEs have been killed. Iwaopeln can warp
and join or get into a battle at any time.


B20F is a very strange floor. For one it has no random encounters whatsoever.
There are a lot of FOEs. The FOEs move around too much so all I can tell you is
the path it go through. The FOEs on this floor can become chasers if you get 
into a battle with a FOE near by. Also don't go back to town and rest the FOEs
will respawn.

When you get down go all the way forward and you'll get a message about danger.
Then Kupala will come, start talking and then a bunch of FOEs will appear. Head
east all the way. Go one step south. Along this passage there will be a 
Diabolix. 

There will be a Cruella that goes around in circles within D1,D2,E1 and E2.
There will an ogre in the D2 area. There is a long vertical passage. There will
a Hunter that roams in B2, B3 and B4. Now head to the north west part of the 
floor.

In B2 there will an ogre sitting still. There will be a Cruella walking back 
and forth in A2 and B2. As well there will be a Diabolix walking in a right 
angle formation in A1, A2 and B2. Now to head to the northwest corner of this
floor. In B2 there will be a long passage leading to it.

In this corner there will be a Cruella walking back and forth in B6 and C6.
There will also be an ogre standing still in B6. There will also be a Diabolix
roaming in a right angle formation in A6, A5 and B5. Are you starting to see 
the pattern?

There will be a Hunter walking back and forth in B5, C5 and D5. Go to the 
southwest corner of the floor for the final batch. There will be an Ogre 
standing still in D6. There will be a Cruella walking back and forth in 6E, E5
and E4.

To end the final batch go get the Diabolix walking in a right angle formation
in E6, E5 and D5. When all the FOEs are dead go to Iwaopeln. Assuming he has
not warped he will be standing in C4. If he did warp just go find him. Once
you defeat him head to A4.

There will be a part that has four squares that make a square. Go to the bottom
left square and go through the passage. Go to the top left part of this room.
It will tell you to go back to Radha. When you go to Radha report your 
results. Quinn will start talking. After that head back to the stairs when
go through the secret passage on B20F to proceed to B21F

Floor 21..........................[FL21] A bounty of relics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Darkhare, Maul, Burstgel, Kingfrog, Silker

New stratum means new monsters, fortunately they're are palette swaps.  The
Darkhares are the average monsters of the bunch. They don't have that great
defense and can hit for moderately high damage. The maul is like the mole. 
Lacking in the defense department ok attack and high HP.

The Burstgels are like Sleepgels. They are very resistent to physical attacks
and can do high damage. You should watch out for blaze. The kingfrogs don't
have that great defense nor attack but have a high amount of HP. The Silkers
are also lacking in defense, attack is okay, but you should really watch out
for all their binds.

Monsters on Floor: Darkhare, Maul, Burstgel, Kingfrog, Silker

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 2 Dinolichs, 1 Kingdile

Kingdiles are very troublesome. They have a high defense and have high attack
as well. They have a nasty attack called shred. It hurts and kill someone with
ease. The Dinolichs have an ok amount of defense but thier attack is the main
thing to worry about. Try treating it like a boss and watch out for thier
skills especially Devour.

Bosses: Ren (only once), Tlatchga (only once)

Ren and Tlatchtga are together in a fight. Go for Ren first.


When you get down put a "stairs ^" icon behind you. Take a step forward and 
then turn right and go forward. Turn left and go all the way forward. Then turn
right and go forward until you get to a door. Go inside and activate the 
Geomagnetic field.

Go back through the door, turn right and go three steps forward. Turn left
and go all the way forward until you get to a door. Go all the way forward, 
when you get to the bridge you'll get a message. Keep going forward and about
halfway there you meet Ren and Tlatchga. You get a card key after you beat
them.

Once you defeat them continue along the bridge, you may want to go to town and
rest though. Once you're off the bridge keep going forward. You'll come across
a door, enter it. Go forward once again and then turn left and go forward. Turn
right, go all the way and then turn left and go all the way. Go down the 
stairs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 22...........................[FL22] The steel rendezvous
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Direwolf, Clawlord

Monsters on Floor: Darkhare, Maul, Burstgel, Direwolf, Kingfrog, Clawlord,
Silker

The direwolves are similar to the Wolves from the first stratum. Their defense
isn't really high but thier attack is high. Blaze can also really hurt your
party. The Clawlords are very resistent to physical attacks. Elemental attacks
are reccomened against them

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 1 Dinolich, 1 Kingdile, 4 Desoulers

The Desoulers are the blue version of the Cutters. They have very high attack
and defense isn't all that bad either. Thier skill slash is hard hitting 
attack that should be watched our for. Several of Desoulers randomly appear
and chase you.

Bosses: N/A

When you get down take a step forward and open the door on your left. Turn
right and go all the way forward. Turn left and go all the way forward and
then turn right and go forward. Turn left and go all the way down the passage
and then go through the door on your right.

When you go through turn right go all the way, turn left go all the way and 
then turn left and go all the way until you get to a passage or rather a 
bridge. Go all the way across the bridge. When you get off the bridge turn 
right, go around the corner and go all the way forward. Go through the door.

Turn right and go all the way forward (it's a long way). Turn right go all the
way and open the door to your left. Turn right go all the way forward, turn
left go all the way forward ignoring the passage/bridge and then left and go
all the way forward.

Turn left go forward and then turn right and go all the way forward ignoring 
the passage. Turn right and out a "stairs ^" icon infront of you. Then go down
the stairs to proceed to B23F.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 23...........................[FL23] Ghost town of granted dreams
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Muskoid, Varaha, Hellbull

The Muskoids have relatively high defense but not a big worry. Defense is 
rather low. The main problem with them is they can put your entire party to
sleep. The Hellbulls can hit very hard so hard it's like crazy. Thier defense
is thier major backfire, exploit it.

The Varaha are like the Hellbull's weaker pallete swap but doesnt like them. 
They too, can hit very hard but not as hard as the Hellbulls. Thier defense
is about the same, perhaps a bit better. Bullrush is an attack that can really
hurt.

Monsters on Floor: Maul, Direwolf, Muskoid, Kingfrog, Clawlord, Silker,
Varaha, Hellbull

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 2 Kingdiles, 4 Desoulers

Both are old FOEs.

Bosses: N/A

When you get down go all the way forward, go a step to the right and open the
door to your left. Go all the way forward and then turn left and go all the 
way forward. Now turn right and go 4 steps forward. Turn left and then go
all the way forward. Open the door when you get there.

Once you're through the door go all the way forward then turn right go all the
forward. Turn right again and go all the way forward. Now turn left and go all
the way forward. Turn left again, go all the way forward then turn right
and go all the way forward.

Turn left go all the way forward, turn left again take step forward, turn right
go all the way, then turn right again go all the way forward. Now turn left
and go all the way forward, turn left again and go forward and then turn right
and go all the way forward.

Turn right once again go all the way forward, ignore the passage. Turn right
AGAIN and go all the way forward AGAIN (it's a long way by the way). Turn
right go 2 steps forward and turn left and go all the way forward. Now turn
right go all the way forward and turn left and go all the way forward.

Turn left once again, go forward. Turn right go all the way forward until you
get to the first passage. Go down this passage and take the first passage you
see. Go to the end of this passage then turn left and go all the way. Go all
the way to your right and then one step to your left. Go down the passage
and then go up the stairs.

Well, we're now back on B22F, don't fret there's a reason. When you get down
go all the way forward (I bet you're sick of that word) then turn left and
go all the way forward. Go all the way east (I'm changing the format because
I'm sick of forward).

Now head all the way south and then head all the way east. Go north all the
way ignoring the bridge/passage.  Head west all the way until you get to a 
door, enter the door. Turn right and go around the corner. Then go all the way
north.

Turn left and go around the corner. You'll be at a bridge now. Nothing left
to do but to cross it. When you get off the bridge go north all the way then
all the way east. Head all the way south then turn left and go around the
corner.

Now go all the way west then all the way south and then all the way east until
you get to a door. I suggest staying away from the FOE. When you're through
the door go east a step and go up the stairs to B21F. You're almost there!
When you get down put a "stairs ^" behind you.

When you get down go all the way north and then all the way west. Stop after
you get to the third you see. Go through it. When you're through go a step west
and then all the way north. You should see a bridge now. Go all the way west.
Head all the way south and then a step west, open the door.

Head west until you come across the second door you see. Go through the and
go to the south part of this room. Check the machine. You'll get about 
something getting turned on (something, not someone). Anyways head to D7 of
B21F. Look for the elevator and go down to B24F.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floor 24...........................[FL24] Road of inner sorrow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New monsters: Kingaspis, Armoroll, Kingyana

The Kingaspis' have rather low defense. Their attack is much to worry about,
thier skill Venom is the thing to worry about. The Kingyanas also have thier
defense as thier weakspot. Attack is okay. They have cure as a skill but rarely
ever use it.

Meet the Armorolls. These little bastards are the most annoying enemies in the
game. Thier resistence to physical attacks is so high it can take an entire 
team to kill one. Their only weakness is fire. Not only do they have high 
attack they have extremely high attack as well.

Monsters on Floor: Kingaspis, Clawlord, Varaha, Armoroll, Hellbull, Kingyana

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 3 Dinolichs, 6 Desoulers

Both old FOEs.

Bosses: N/A

There's nothing to do on B24F. This floor is basically useless. All it pretty
much does is unlock a quest or two. Nothing here, go back up to B21F via
elevator. Head north until you get to another elevator. Go down to B25F to 
face your fate!!!

Varaha, Armoroll, Hellbull, Kingyana

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 6 Desoulers, 3 Kingdiles, 3 Treetusks

Treetusks hit hard. Thier defense is really high but has some tough skin on
them. It has an okay amount of HP but nothing to worry about. It's weakness
is elemental attacks.

Bosses: Etreant, Dragon (after putting ankh motor in the machine for the
"awakening the serpent" quest.

You can only face Etreant one and it not a black FOE but is faced after an
event.

When you get down to B25F via the elevator head all the way west until you get 
to a passage. Head all the way north and then all the way east. Head all the
way north and head all the way west, you may run into a treetusk along the way.
Head south until you get to a passage and then all the way east.

Go south and then one step west. Then head all the way south. Go a step west 
again and then all the way south again. Head all the way east then all the way
north. Then go all the way east now (it's a long way). Now head all the way
south and then all the way west until you get to a passage.

Head south and then and then all the way west until you get to a passage. Head
south and then all the way east (almost there...). Head all the way south, 
face west and go around the corner. Head all the way north until you get to a
passage, go all the way east.

Face north and go all the way north (it's quite a long way). Head 4 steps east
and then all the way north. You'll meet someone, I won't say who. Use the key
card on the door and go in and watch the scene. After you defeat Etreant you'll
watch the ending scene and the credits. 

After you're with all the ending stuff go back to where Etreant was. Go two
steps east and then all the way north. Head west until you get a message about
a hidden stratum. Face the wall and go down the stairs to the sixth stratum.
The next 5 floors are known as post-game.

New monsters: Hellfly, Ironcrab, Monocyte, Rockwood

The hellflies have an okay amount if defense but probably the weakest of the 
new monsters. They can hit moderately hard, but same as defense the weakest of
the bunch. Ironclaws hit extremely high and they also have a deadly attack
called siccors. They are very resistent to physical and elemental attacks are
their weakness.

Monocytes hit hard and have moderately high defense. They also have a very 
annoying attack called W Plasma that petrifies a party number. The rockwoods

against pierce attacks.

Secret Area Monsters: N/A

FOES: 7 Songbirds, 4 Teralichs

Bosses: Drakoid, Dragoid, Wyrmoid, Primevil

The oid monsters are just copies of the Dragons. Primevil is an event and can 
be fought as many times as you want.

Before you continue on you must have beaten Wrym and Dragon. Beating the Drake
is recomended by not neccasairy. Most of B30F is straight corridors. Head all
the way north and then all the way west. Now go all the way south. Now go all
the way west and then all the way north.

Go all the way west, then all the way south, then all the way west, then all 
the way north, then all the way west, then all the way south, then all the way
west, then all the way north and then all the way west. Now head all the way
south and all the way east.

Now go all the way north, all the way west (that's annoying) and then all the 
way south. Along the passage to your east there are three doors. The one the 
left you need to beat Drake to get in. It holds a fountain. The middle door
requires you to beat the Wrym. It's way to continue.

The one on the right requires you to beat Dragon. It holds a back and forth
warp to the room right infront of the Geomagentic on B26F. Enter the middle 
door. Go all the way north, open the door. Head all the way north again. There
will be a secret passage here. There is no way out once you go through unless 
you use a Warpwire.

When you're through go forward open the door. Beat the Drakoid and then enter
the door. Now defeat the Dragoid and go through the door. Now defeat the 
Wyrmoid. The door the Wrymoid was guarding leads to Primevil. Get prepared and
then head through the door. Once you defeat Primevil you beat the game.

Rank in Tier List:5

My Description: Landskenchts are the balanced class of the game. They can hit
pretty hard, have OK defense, agility is average, vitality is pretty good. They
use swords and axes are thier weapon of choice. I've used both axes and swords
and I think swords are much better.

Swords have much more techs but are weaker than axes. While axes, have only 3
techs and have far superior attack. Attacks like crush can completely destroy
one opponent, but allslash can take out a group. Allslash is probably the best
of the Landsknecht skills, because of the fact it can hit hard and at higher
levels it can hit up to four enemies.

Another up that that sword side has, are the chasers. Chasers are Blazer, 
Freezer and Shocker. These attacks follow up an Alchemest's atttack. Blazer
activates when a fire spell activates, Freezer activates after an ice spell is
used and Shocker is activated after a lightning spell is used. This can be a 
deadly combo against enemies (especially bosses) who are weak to elemental 
attacks.

Another cool feature that Landskenchts have is 2-Hit. This nifty little feature
has a chance of making you attack twice when attacking normally. With an axe
this is very deadly, and with a sword it's deadly not very deadly but deadly.

All in all, a Landsknecht is a great person to be in your party. Looking at
the position in the tier list, they are right in the middle. They may seem a 
little low but competition is very tough in the tier list world.

1.2 Protector......................[PROT]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name:Protector
Description: Holy defenders of the weak. A protector's sword are invaluable
when in the dungeon.
Skill list:

HP Up
TP Up
DEF Up
Shields
Aegis
En garde
Provoke
Flee
Parry
Fortify
Defender
F. Guard
B. Guard
Antifire
Antivolt
Anticold
Smite
Cure
Cure II
Stalker
Mine

Rank in Tier List:3

My Description: Protectors are the Paladins of the game. They have great 
defense, good attack, good vitality and meh agility. They can only use swords
but they can hold shields. If you have a protector, he/she must be wearing a 
shield. You can't use some of the Protector skills without shield equiped.

A lot of the protector skills are used for defensive methods. F. Guard protects
everyone in the frontline and B. Guard protects everyone in the back line. 
Defender is one of the most useful skills in the game. It increases the entire
party's defense. It's quite useful in bosss fights.

The anti skills are another thing to look at when you have a protector. What
these skills do is they reduce damage from elemental attacks. At LVL 5 they
nullify them. If they are higher than LVL 5 they absorb. These skills are
absolutely needed in post game (after beating floor 25) for bosses.

In my opinion, Aegis and En Garde are useless. Aegis makes it possible to
survive a killing blow with 1 HP, but after that you're screwed if up against
a fast enemy. En Garde randomly stops a blow, but it's not that common and if
you try increase the level you're wasting skill points.

A good method for defensive purposes is P&P or P&F (stupid names I know). P&P
stands for Provoke and Parry. P&F stands for Provoke and Fortify. Provoke
increases your defense and attracts the enemy to you. Parry automatically 
blocks attacks. Fortify greatly increases you defense. P&P is recommendeded
for boss fights and P&F is recommended for hard enemy fights and FOE fights.

Smite is another interesting skill. Smite is the only protector skill that is 
used for offensive combat. In order for Smite to work, you need to have a 
shield. Smite is a bash skill (like staves) so keep that in mind. It is one of
the strongest skills in the entire so be sure to get it.

Cure and Cure II aren't all that good for Protectors. They can heal but they
don't heal that much. Flee is pointless since you could just run and then use
a warpwire or magnet. Stalker is a waste of skill points. All it does it reduce
chances of getting into a battle.

The protector is a highly recommened class for defensive purposes and 
offensive. They are also absolutely needed for the post game bosses. They are
number three in tier list. They are the third highest and have tons of stuff
to back up for that position.

1.3 Dark Hunter....................[DRKH]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Dark Hunter
Description: Pinpoint lashes of thier whip can weaken opponents. Use thier 
skills wisely to turn the tide of battle.
Skill list:

HP Up
TP Up
ATK Up
Swords
Boost Up
Cloak
Viper
Gag
Cuffs
Shackles
Ecstasy
Climax
Hypnos
Nerve
Mirage
Drain
Bait
Petrify
Take

Rank in Tier List:7

My Description: Dark Hunters are the status inflictors of the game. They have
OK attack, less than average defense, good speed and OK vitality. Dark Hunters
can either wield swords or whips. They each have thier own pros so lets see a 
rundown.

The whips side has Viper,Gag,Shackles, Ecstasy and Climax. Gag binds the head,
meaning you can't do magic, Cuffs binds the arms meaning you can't basically
all of your skills. Shackles binds you legs meaning you can't do some attacks
but other than that no other effects.

Ecstasy is a skill, in which when an enemy fully binded (head,arms and legs are
binded) it deals massive damage. Against normal enemies this is useless, but is
good against strong FOEs and bosses. Though, keep in mind that some bosses are 
resistent to binds. Climax is an attack that OHKO's at low HP. Only really 
useful against Golem for the rare drop.

The sword side has Hypnos, Nerve, Mirage, Drain, Bait and Petrify. Hypnos 
puts an enemy to sleep. Nerve paralyzes an enemy. Mirage confuses an enemy.
Petrify, well pertifies an enemy. Drain is probably the best Dark Hunter skill
because it can do good damage and when maxed out, the the damage you do, you 
get that much HP.

Cloak is useless. Boost up causes increases the improvement when boosting, 
meaning you get stronger. Fury is a usefull skill especially in boss fights. 
What it does is, when your HP is low your damage increases. Bosses can do 
heavy damage and with the less than average defense, some hits can take you to
low HP. Your Dark Hunter will probably attack before your Medic heals so it 
can help to get revenge with you still living.

Looking at the position in the tier list you must think that Dark Hunters are
useless pieces of garbage. They are low in the tier list but that by no means
they suck. I have a Dark Hunter in my party and hes doin' great. I'd even
choose him over a Troubador.

1.4 Survivalist....................[SURV]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Survivalist
Description: Fleet-footed and wise in the ways of the forest, thier bow skills
make them desirable allies. 
Skill list:

HP Up
Tp Up
AGI Up
Bows
Ambush
Aware
1st Hit
Trickery
Quicken
Cloak
Escape
1st Turn
Trueshot
Multihit
Disable
Apollon
Owl-Eye
Stalker
Chop
Mine
Take

Rank in Tier List:2

My Description: Survivalists are the rangers or archers of the game, due to the
fact that they use bows. Survivalists have very high speed, good attack, good
defense and OK vitality. Like I said before, Survivalists can only use bows as
weapons. Survivalists are the only class that have three of the obtain skills.

Survivalists don't have many attacking skills. Multihit attacks several 
enemies, the higher the level the more enemies attacked. Trueshot is a very
useful skill. It does stong, piercing bow attack. Apollon is one of the games
strongest attacks. You fire a shot in the air and then three turns later it 
comes down with heavy damage. Another good thing is, you can do other attacks
while Apollon is in effect.

Ambush increases chance of getting preemtive strikes and Aware decreases the
chance of an enemy ambuhsing you. If you have extra skill points these two
aren't so bad. 1st Hit is useless since you will probably go first the next
turn anyways. 1st Turn however, is very good. In boss fights like the dragon
fights, it can really help your Medic.

Trickery lowers the enemy's evasion. Quicken increases the speed of your entire
party. They are both OK, but not worth maxing. I find Owl-Eye and Stalker
useless. Disable binds the enemies legs, not worth it if you have a Dark Hunter
or Hexer. Cloak is useless, it takes up a turn and wastes skill points. I mean
why would you want to hide? Escape is also useless since you have five people
to run with.

Survivalists are one of my favourite classes. In my first playthrough I always
had him in my party. They are great attackers even in the back line (I always
keep mine in my backline). They are great addition to any party and I would
definately recommend one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5 Medic..........................[MEDC]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Medic
Description: Unskilled in battle, thier healing arts allow experienced warriors
to survive difficult battles.
Skill list:

HP Up
TP Up
Atk Up
Healer
Patch Up
Scavenge
TP Regen
Cure
Cure II
Cure III
Salve 
Salve II
Revive
Unbind
Refresh
Immunize
CPR
Regen
Caduceus
H. Touch
Chop

Rank in Tier List:1

My Description: Medics are the healer or the White Mages of the game. Medics
have low attack, okay speed, good tec, okay vitality, and okay defense. They
use staves as weapons. I strongly reccomend that every party has a medic.

The only attacking skill that the Medic has is Caduceus. For a medic, it's 
surprisingly strong. The only problem is that you need 10 skill points into
ATK UP, which can really cut into your healing skill points. 

Patch up isn't worth putting a lot of skill points into. Just getting is okay,
but don't rely on it for your healing. TP Regen is useless because how little
TP it restores and it's even more useless if you have a Troubador with 
relaxing. Scavenge is a good skill for getting rare items drops like from 
the Drake.

Cure will be good starting healing skill but later on you should get Cure II
and Cure III.  All three of those shouldn't really go past 3 for a final build
in the end of the game. Salve heal more than Cure and heals all members of
your party. Like the cures it shouldn't really go beyond 3. Salve II heals
better than Cure II and heals all of your party. You should max this skill
out for it's an extremely useful skill.

You should only put one point into Revive. Unbind, when you first get it, gets
rid of 1 bind. At level 3 it gets rid of 2 and at level 5, 3 binds. For 
Refresh just get to level 8 because thats when you get all the status ailments
cured. Immunize should be maxed as soon as possible. It is one the best skills
in the game. It makes everything a hell lot easiar. It raises you party's 
defense to everything in the game.

CPR is useless since they come back low HP. Regen is pointless as well since
your better with just normal healing. H. Touch is also useless. Don't waste
skill points on chop for the medic.

Overall the Medic should be a part of any party. They're number one because
they keep your party alive, they can do good damage (Cadaceus) and they 
are like all the items packed in to one (cute, if you have medi-loli) package.

1.6 Alchemest......................[ALCH]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Alchemest
Description: Those who study control of nature. The power of fire, ice and 
lightning are at thier command.
Skill list:

TP Up
Fire Up
Ice Up
Volt Up
Toxins
Scavenge
TP Regen
Fire
Flame
Inferno
Ice
Freeze
Cocytus
Volt
Thunder
Thor
Poison
Venom
Sight
Warp
Chop

Rank in Tier List:6

My Description:Alchemests have pretty much okay every thing except for strength
and maybe defense. Thier Tec however is good.Alchemests are the elemental magic
damage dealers or the black mages of the game. They're very useful because 
thier magic is strong and they elemental advantages. They also work very well 
with Landsknetchs who have chasers.

Poison is a skill that it seen everywhere in RPGs, but for those of you who 
don't know what it is, it's an attack that deals damage every turns (in turn
based games anyways). Poison hits one person and Vemon hits all enemies. Early
in the game poison can be useful, but later they aren't as good.

Just a note. Inferno, Cocytus and Thor don't need Flame, Freeze and thunder
(respectively) as pre-requisites, instead they need Fire Up, Ice Up and Volt
Up (respectively, once again) at level 5. That means you have the option
of skipping the middle tier.

Warp is pretty useful skill since you can warp back to the Geomagnetic Field,
thus rendering Warp Wires and Magents useless. Only put one point into it
though. Only use sight if you are very cautious FOES, otherwise ignore it.
Scavenge can be useful for getting rare items.

What I recommend for Alchemests is focus on one or two elemental trees. 
Although it is possible for them to have tri-elemental build it's very skill
point consuming. I would recommend the fire tree because most bosses are
weak to fire. Un-like the Medic the Alchemest doesn't have a melee attack 
besides the normal attack.

Overall Alchemests are great damage dealers. They can totally decimate some
parties. They may seem low in the tier list but they are actually quite useful.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.7 Troubadour.....................[TROU]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Troubadour
Description: Lively dancers and singers who inspire the party. Thier support
is always welcome in combat.
Skill list:

Hp Up
TP Up
Songs
Divinity
Bravery
Shelter
Mercury
Erasure
Recovery
Stamina
Blaze
Frost
Shock
Ifrit
Ymir
Taranis
Healing
Relaxing
Stalker
Return
Take

Rank in Tier List:4

My Description: Troubadors are the support characters of the game. I can't seem
to find another character from a game that is similar to it. Troubadors can
put buffs (status ailments that help you) on your party. Troubadors have pretty
much average stats. Troubadors can use swords, staffs and bows. Just remember
that

Divinty is an okay passive skill though maxed out, you get 30% of experience
added, which doesn't make much of a difference in the begining of the game.
Stalker could be useful if your in real danger, but you should always a Warp
Wire. Return is useful for forgetful people who don't bring Warp Wires.

Bravery is a very useful skill that increases attacks, especially against
bosses with a lot of defense. Shelter is another useful skill that increases
defense. Good against enemies that hit hard. Mercury is okay, but it's not
really worth it since you only have three buff spaces.

Eruasure removes buffs on the enemy. Don't bother going past level five since
you get rid of three (the max amount of buffs) buffs at level 5. Recovery
is pointless if you have a Medic (which you should). Stamina increases party
only for that battle so it's pretty stupid and you better of with better buffs.

Flame, Forst and Shock change your attack attribute. It's good against bosses
with elemental weakness. There's not point to putting a lot skill points into 
them because it just lowers TP cost.

Ifrit, Ymir and Taranis all do the same thing. Ifrit is fire, Ymir is Ice
and Taranis is Volt. What they do is, they lower the enemy resistence to
the element and increase yours. It good be useful against the three dragons
but that's what the Protector is for. When you put more points the increase/
decrease increases.

Healing and Relaxing are both excellent skills. In really long boss/FOE fights
these skills are really useful. Healing gives a little HP every turn and 
Relaxing gives a little TP every turn. I'd say that relaxing is better though.
The more you level them up the more the HP/TP increase.

Troubadors are great support members. They are especially great for boss and
FOE fights. They are also useful in post game. They are fourth in the Tier
list and they should definately be there.

1.8 Ronin..........................[RONI]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Ronin
Description:Foreign masters of all forms of combat. Considering honorable
death a virtue, their defense is lacking. Proud soldiers who demand the front.
Skill list:

HP Up
TP Up
ATK Up
Katanas
Sight
Crit Up
Ibuki
Kesagiri
Overhead
Zamba
Midareba
Orochi
Seigan
Mikiri
Koteuchi
Raizuki
Iai
Kubichi
Gatotsu
Hyosetsu
Mine


Rank in Tier List: 8
My Description: Ronins have great maybe the best attack. Agility is good, tec 
is a little less than average. Vitality is good and defense is absolutely the
worst in the entire game. Ronins have special buffs called stances. They need
to be in certain stances to use certain attacks.

The Overhead stance is probaly the best stance for the Ronin. Zamba is just
one strong slice, nothing special. Midareba is one the most strongest attacks
in the game. It hit an enemy several for VERY high damage. Orochi is simply
a slash with fire imbued with it.

Seigan has the same effect as Overhead. Mikiri is just stops on enemy, bad side
is that is only happens once. Koteuchi does damage as well has a chance of
binding their arms. Raizuki is like Orochi except it does lighting damage
instead if fire damage.

Iai increases speed. Kubiuchi is one of the two OHKO moves in the game. Even
maxed it has a rather low chance of working. Gatotsu is a really strong, really
fast pierce attack. Hyosetsu is like the other two elemental attacks except
it does ice damage instead.

Sight is a really good passive if you're going for long runs because after a 
long time it turns night. Crit up increases chances of critical attack but
when maxed it doesn't have that much a difference. Ibuki is useless, let your
medic do the healing. Kesagiri is just one really strong slash attack.

Ronins are the tanks of the game. You might want to give them the best armor
you can get due to their extremely low defense. Looking at the tier list you
think that they are garbage but theres not a lot of classes so it's kind of
messed. Regardless of tier position they still own.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.9 Hexer..........................[HEXR]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name:Hexer
Description: Thier hexes dictate whether an enemy lives or dies. Thier innate
gifts are rarely seen. Tormentors used to the back line.
Skill list:

HP Up
TP Up
Curses
Stagger
Sapping
Fraility
Leaden
Blinding
Relapse
Cranial
Abdomen
Immobile
Torpor
Corrupt
Revenge
Evil Eye
Paralyze
Betrayal
Suicide
Lure
Mine

Rank in Tier List:9
My Description: Hexers are the status inflictors of the game, but they don't do
damage like D's. They have weak attack, ok speed, good tec, and less than
average vitality. Almost all thier skills involve some sort of status ailment.
They can induce almost every status ailment.

Sapping decreases attack, good for hard hitting monsters. Fraility decreases
defense go against high defense people and bosses or FOEs. Leaden decreases
speed good for really fast enemies like Macabres. Blinding blinds the enemy.
Relaspe decreases recovery time against status aliments meaning they'll be
afflicted for more turns.

Cranial just binds the head, Abdomen binds the enemy's arms and Immobile binds
the enemy's legs. Torpor has a chance putting all the enemies to sleep, but
from my experience it doesn't work very well. Corrupt is one of my favourite
skills because it curses the entire party. 

Revenge simply does damage. From my experiences it is very weak. Evil eye 
terrifies one enemy. It links to a lot of attacks. Paralyze paralyzes the enemy
but only when terrified (evil eye). Betryal makes one enemy attack another one.
Suicide makes an enemy hit itself until it dies.

Stagger is useful skill. Whenever you enter a battle there is a chance that all
the enemies will be stunned meaning they can't do anything on the first turn.
Lure is the opposite of the ward chime, it makes the enemy encounter rate
increase but only for 50 steps.

Hexers can be useful if you don't have a D but are not that great in boss
fight because several bosses are resistant to status. They aren't great melee
fighters either. Just because they are last in the tier list doesn't mean they
suck. They can be useful in some cases like Etreant or monsters with high 
stats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Quests...........................[QEST]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quests are are mini-missions that be can accepted in the Golden Deer Pub from
Valerie. Almost everytime you get to a new floor atleast one quest will open
up. Some quests can only be opened up beating other Quests. If you need help on
quests go to my Quests/missions guide. It's in the Etrian Odyssey In-Depth 
walkthroughs section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Missions.........................[MISS]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missions can be accepted from Radha Hall. You need to defeat missions to 
proceed in the game. Most missions have to with defeating bosses. After the 
20th floor mission there are no missions. If you need help on the missions
go to my Quests/Missions walkthrough. It's in the In-Depth section of Etrian
Odyssey guides. My walkthrough also explains how to beat them, the walkthrough
is probably better though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Stratagies.......................[STRA]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the strategies section of my the Walkthough (but I think you've 
probably already noticed...). So far there are only two strategies, but I hope
there are more to come.

Treefrog/Immoa method: Go get into a battle with either a Treefrog or an Immoa.
Then wait until they summon another Treefrog/Immoa. Kill the newly summoned
monster. Then repeat until you have killed thirty of them. If you kill more 
than thirty the monsters killed after that won't go into the experience count.
This is better done solo for there is massive experience gain. Treefrogs are
located on B11F-B13F. Immoas are located on B16F-B19F.

Easy money: For this strategy get five survivilists. Then give them either
chop, mine or take. Then send them into the labyrinth and get items from item
points. Early in the game the best place is B1F. Just take the shortcut in the
begining and chop there. The best place is in B21F. There is mine point right
beside the Geomagnetic Field. Each item sells for 400-500 en. This is the best
place for farming En.
