       020 - Introduction
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Hello everyone, and thank you
for clicking the link to view
this guide. I hope that this
will be a helpful tool for you
while playing Revenant Wings.
Use the glossary numbers to find
what you need.

The game is a sequel to its PS2
predecessor, where we last saw
our heroes on Sky Fortress
Bahamut to prevent a war from
occurring. They succeeded, and
Ivalice fell into an era of
peace. However, as what
inevitably happens in any
sequel, new problems arise. Vaan
and Penelo stand up to these
challenges.

Before I speak further I must
warn all who read this that
there will be some spoilers
throughout, both for this game
and the previous one. I assume
you have played the first game,
and if you didn't, the portable
version won't make too much
sense otherwise.

I'll note that I WILL mix
storyline missions with
optional/melee missions. I will
cover these as soon as they
become available, not in a
different section.

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

--------------------------------

034 - Gambits

Gambits allow group leaders to
automatically use a single
magick or ability they've
previously learned. You can set
gambits from the Equip Screen or
at any time during battle.

Unfortunately in this FFXII game
you can only equip one gambit
per character in any given
moment. Make good use of which
one you choose. It is up to you
and what you value best--
however, your preferred setup
can change depending on the
battle you wish to complete.

Here is a complete list of each
character's gambits:

035 - Quickenings

Quickenings are powerful
abilities that can instantly
turn the tide of battle. Using
quickenings consumes a unit's
Mist charge, which accumulates
as you defeat enemies. Defeating
certain boss monsters unlocks
new quickenings.

Here is a complete list of each
character's quickening:

Vaan: Pyroclasm
  - Deal heavy damage to all foe
  - You obtain this after beatin

Penelo: Dance of Rapture
  - Fully restore all allies' HP
  - You obtain this after beatin

Ashe: Empyrean's Edict
  - Prevent all foes from summon
  - You obtain this after beatin

Basch: Apocalypse Shield
  - Nullifies all damage to lead
  - You obtain this after beatin

036 - Attack Types

There are three types of attack,
which act in a rock-paper-
scissors relationship.

Melee units attack at a close
range. While effective against
ranged units, their attacks have
difficulty reaching flying
units.

Ranged units attack from a
distance. Though very effective
against flying units, ranged
units are little use against
foes in melee range.

Flying units attack from the
air. Although they can pick off
melee units with ease, they're
extremely vulnerable to ranged
attacks.

037 - Natures

All attacks and Espers have a
nature associated with the
damage they deal. Each unit is
vulnerable to attacks of a
certain nature. Attacks of this
nature will deal additional
damage. You can view each unit's
weakness from the Status Screen
before battle.

Here is a list of all the
different kinds and their
weaknesses:

       Nature | Weakness
      --------+----------
        None   |   None
        Fire   |   Water
       Water  |  Thunder*
      Thunder |  Ground**
        Ground  |   Fire
        Healing |   None

* The exception is Shivan, Shiva
also enemies with a water (but
ice really) nature who are weak
to fire.

** The exception is Remora and R

038 - Summoning 101

Groups
--------------------------------
Before we talk about summoning,
it is important to know about
group leaders. Party members who
accompany you in battle are
referred to as group leaders. Up
to five group leaders can join a
mission. Some missions may
require that certain party
members be present.

A group is made up of its leader
and the Espers under his
control. Each group leader can
control up to eight Espers.

Gates
--------------------------------
Now to summoning gates. These
are portals that open on the
World of Illusion. These gates
enable their controller to
summon Espers. You must control
a summoning gate in order to use
it. Blue gates are gates that
you control, red gates are
controlled by your enemies, and
colorless gates are neutral
gates that have not been
captured.

Move a group leader to a neutral
or enemy-controlled summoning
gate to capture it. Espers
cannot capture summoning gates.
Be aware that enemies will try
to capture gates as well.

Touching a blue summoning gate
will bring up the following
commands: Summon, Fortify
Espers, and Queue. Certain
requirements must be met before
the Fortify Espers command
becomes available.

Commands
--------------------------------
Select Summon and choose the
group to which the Esper will be
assigned. Then, select which
Esper to summon. Touch the
Summon command repeatedly to
summon the previously selected
Esper.

Select Queue to view the Espers
being summoned through the gate.
Touch an Esper in the queue
twice to cancel the summon.

Select Fortify Espers to
temporarily raise the level of
all allied Espers. Each
fortification raises the Espers'
levels by one, up to a maximum
of five. Each successive
fortification requires more
Astral Power (AP). AP can be
used to fortify your Espers,
temporarily raising their level.
The first fortification consumes
one unit of AP, the second two,
etc.

Some Espers can use magicks and
abilities. A list of each
Esper's magicks and abilities
can be found on the Status
Screen. Select an Esper to bring
up the Magicks/Abilities
command.

Select an Esper and use the
Dismiss command to return the
Esper to the World of Illusion.
The battle party's Affinity
determines the number of Espers
you can have summoned at once.

Affinity
--------------------------------
The battle party's Affinity is
the total of each group leader's
Affinity. If the Affinity bar is
full, you cannot summon more
Espers. Controlling higher-
ranked Espers costs more
Affinity. This is an Esper's
summoning cost. Balance the
strength and cost of Espers when
forming your battle party. When
an Esper falls in battle or is
dismissed, the Affinity used to
control it becomes available
again after a short time.

Pacts
--------------------------------
If you want to summon a
particular Esper, you must make
a pact with it. Forging a pact
with an Esper requires an amount
of auracite equal to its rank.
There is no particular benefit
to amassing auracite, so it is
best to forge pacts early and
often.

Espers with which pacts can be
formed glow yellow on the Ring
of Pacts. You can form a pact
with an Esper once the Esper
adjacent to it is enlisted,
moving from the inside of the
ring outward. Some Espers only
become available once certain
conditions are met.

Troupes
--------------------------------
Regardless of how may pacts
you've forged, you cannot summon
more than five types of Espers
in a battle. That set of Espers
is an Esper Troupe. New Espers
must be assigned to a troupe
using the Modify command before
you can summon them. You can
create up to three troupes for
use in different situations.

At the start of battle, group
leaders are assigned Espers from
the selected troupe that match
their attack type. Starting
Espers are indicated by a
crystal icon on the Battle Party
Screen.

039 - Other Basics

Here are some more game elements
that will be helpful to review:

Foraging: Some battlefields
contain Foraging Points,
locations at which a group
leader can forage for food to
restore the HP of all members of
his group.

Scavenging: Many valuable
resources lie strewn across the
battlefields you discover. Group
leaders can scavenge these
resources, recovering items for
later use.

Soul Crystals: Possess the power
to revive fallen group leaders.
Destroying enemy soul crystals
is often the key to victory.

World Map: You can access menus
and functions using the icons in
the bottom- right corner of the
World Map Screen.
 - Menu Icon: Opens the Party Me
  pressing the X button.
 - Tomaj Icon: Talk to Tomaj to 
  identically to the notice boar
 - Airship Icon: Opens the Airsh
  disembark the airship.
 - Named locations on the World 
  interest. Locations containing
  marked with a flag.

Melee Battles: Entering a
location not marked by a flag
allows for melee battles with
unbound Yarhi or freebooting sky
pirates. If you reach an
encounter where enemies are too
powerful, use melee battles to
raise your characters' levels.

Not too complicated, in most
cases. Well, that's about all
the beginning stuff I have,
let's get one with the rest
already...remember, although I
said it before I'll say it now
too--I will explain side/melee
missions in the chapter section
they appear, not in a separate
place.

| Vaan The Sky Pirate - The
Glabados Ruins |
|                               
| While exploring the Glabados
Ruins, Vaan is soon separated
from the others. | | He must
find his friends before they
leave him behind! |
|                               
| Red Flan - Gelatinous mass
that attacks with a lunge of its
fiery head. | | Type: Melee

| Mandatory Characters: Vaan,
Penelo, Balthier, and Fran |
|                               
| Here we find Vaan wandering by
himself. A flan approaches, and
a tutorial of | | the game
begins. "You must get past the
flan to proceed." Then the game
| | launches into details about
controlling, moving, and
attacking. Anyway, do | | what
it instructs. Vaan will be quite
proud of his accomplishment of
killing | | the lone flan.
Whatever. Next, find Penelo.
She's straight ahead. You will |
| need to kill another flan
first. Yay, we found her. The
game will go on to | | explain
that Penelo heals only in this
version and a short explanation
about | | handling multiple
units. |
|                               
| Time to find Balthier and
Fran. You will have to kill
THREE flans (=o!) Then | | after
a little bit more of walking
Vaan finds them. They will enter
together | | and the mission is
completed. Vaan and Penelo will
level up. |
|

Now we reach a cutscene. The
crew has found some treasure.
But oh noes, there's trouble.
Seems as though Ifrit decided to
show up...

| Joined by Balthier and Fran,
Vaan and Penelo reach the heart
of the Glabados | | Ruins. But
something stands between them
and the coveted treasure... |

| Here we go. This battle is so
easy you don't even have to do
anything except | | stand there.
Ifrit will perform his trademark
Hellfire move, which summons | |
up fiery columns for damage
towards characters nearby.
Nothing at all to | | worry
about though. This battle is
over as soon as it started. |
|

After the battle our heroes
quickly realize the whole place
will soon cave in. This leads to
the separation of Balthier and
Fran from Vaan and Penelo, and
also the beginning of the first
chapter.

Prologue Complete!

Here we are introduced to Milo,
Kytes, and Tomaj. Then a
cutscene involving a falling
airship. Hmm. Sounds like
mission time.

| Treasure is all well and good

| Ugh, another stupid tutorial
battle. Oh well. This is good
practice. Now we | | learn about
all the different attack types
and the "rock-paper-scissors" |
| relationship this game has.
Attack the Slyph with Vaan, the
Garchimacera by | | Kytes, and
the Alraune by Filo. They'll
fall quickly. You pretty much
don't | | even have to do
anything. Until more come in
pairs of two. Then you simply |
| redirect your characters
towards their respective
enemies. |

game. Anyway, take out the
Slyph. Next is a tutorial over
area attacks. | | Do as it asks.
Note that if you walk over to
the Giza Rabbits, they'll give |

lesson is given about point-

Kill the rest of the Alraune and

| This battle can be hard for

summon one extra | | Esper (I
recommend the imp because all
but one of your enemies are
Melee). I | | suggest taking
care of Gijuk first (group your
party to the bottom of the | |
screen where he'll go). After
that, stay on top of resummoning
your Espers; | | and don't
forget to use those handy
abilities everyone has! If
you're pretty | | careful and
swift everything should be fine
here. |

For obvious reasons everyone
leaves the room. Vaan takes off
after Penelo and Tomaj meet up
with the rest. Ba'Gamnan seems
to tag along too. Once they
reach the sky, a new chapter
begins.

Chapter 1 complete!

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
       200 - Chapter Two
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Time to name the new airship.
You can pick whatever you want.
The default is The Galbana. Then
a tutorial will explain things
about talking and shopping--just
interaction in general. Try it
out now. Talk to Penelo twice to
hear different things. Then talk
with Filo twice to take off.

Yay, another tutorial about
piloting the airship. -_- This
is in case you are a total
airhead who's never played a
game ever. Once you land, a
cutscene will occur. It's off to
a place called:

The Bosco Pampa - Verdant
flatland broken by patches of
sky. Well-preserved ruins dot
the plain, attestation to an
ancient civilization that
survives to this day.

| First of all, the Antions will
never actually hurt the unknown
man. Simply | | walk up to them
and defeat all three. You will
not need to fight any of the | |
other monsters...until the
second part of this mission,
that is. Now you | | need to
save his companion. They never
hurt her either, so don't worry
about | | that. Time to look
around for all the treasures and
scavenging items. After | | all
this, approach the friend and
beat the surrounding Antlions. |

So yeah, as it turns out this
guy's name is Lluyd. From now on
he is a permanent member of the
party. Another cutscene with him
explaining stuff. You may equip
the vest and the rod. Fane of
Gucuma Qul has become available.
In case you're wonder what the
manual is for, we'll get to that
shortly. First another tutorial
about world map navigation. Also
don't forget to equip the new
guy's gambit.

Before we head over to the new
area, let's go back to where we
just completed the previous
mission. A Monster Melee fight
has become available. Head back
to areas frequently to see if
you missed a free fight.

soar above the temple, catching

adjust your Troupe accordingly,

| No summoning gates for this
battle. I should note that once
you open some of | | the chests,
hidden monsters will then
appear. So be sure to clear the
area | | before opening
something. As the small demo
beforehand will tell you, press
| | the switches with a leader
to unlock passages. Obviously
the switch color | | corresponds
with the wall color. |
|                               
| Defeating the area with the
mage moogle is tough, I'd say
it's better to | | take out his
surrounding Espers first. You
will probably lose an Esper in |
| the process. Finishing that,
heal, and unlock the yellow
wall. Fight the | | Alraune,
take the treasure, then go back
to eventually bring down the
blue | | wall. Fight the sky
pirate here. Examine the green
switch. Go back and down | | the
hall to fight the white mage-
looking guy. After that, battle
more of the | | Sagittarius to
find the final treasure. Then
make your way to the flag. |
|                               
| ...Only to find that it was a
trap! Great, Espers are gone.
You'll have to | | do this the
old fashioned way. It's too bad
you can't use Bombs, as Titan is
| | weak against Fire. At least
there's still Kytes. Make use of
his Firaga move | | while
fighting. Not long into battle,
Ba'Gamnan will show up...and
help! He | | will make the fight
much more beatable. If someone
falls, have Lluyd perform | |
his Revive move, which he should
have learned by now. |

This means | | that your enemy
can resurrect continuously until
it's destroyed, but you can | |
also do this too. So this means
you'll have to be somewhat quick
with this | | fight. Capture
summon gates when you can. Watch
carefully, because they will | |
try to sneak to your soul

keep a constant eye | | on your
Esper amount and replenish when
they die (because they will). |
| Eventually you should just be

still much to do in where we

Whew, this area is FINALLY done.
Rummage through your spoils and
be happy. We're finally starting
to make some money in the game.
Talk to everyone on the airship
if you wish. Let's head over to
the next place. This is where
Tomaj will first talk about the
Notice Board, something you
should be very familiar with if
you have played the first game.

In fact, there are three new
missions available. To view them
click the Tomaj icon once you're
wandering around. Let's try out
the first one.

|                               
| Fortunately, since I made you
complete the optional missions
before this, | | these leaders
should be no match. You DID
train with other missions,
right? | | Anyway, this time the
enemy really WILL attack the
neutral ally. So you must | |
hurry here. Take the first
leader to the left that's
attacking the aegyl. | | Then go
right and defeat the next
leader, sealing the summon gate.
Once you | | approach the third
aegyl, another Seeq leader will
show up. So he will try | | to
rush the aegyl coming back
(because it's stupid and won't
go the other | | way) so hurry
to where you were and take him
out ASAP. Then finish the rest.
| | Lots of things have a
weakness of fire so summon
Espers that inflict fire. |

You can now buy stuff from
Tomaj's little shop. Go to the
airship and talk with him. The
Sky Saloon is still not
available at this time. In
addition, you should already
have all of the weapons and
armor he offers. The only thing
new is the Accessory tab, which
should be: Winged Boots, Corsage
Bracelet, Traveler's Pouch, Gold
Earrings, Gauntlets, and Mythril
Gloves. Check my Tomaj's Shop
part of the guide to see the
full list available at this
point and their prices.

Back to the Rise again. It's
time for another Melee.

Okay, it's time to take the trip
towards our next goal. Which
happens to be:

Fane Of Tehp Qul: Central shrine
on the Isle of the Megalith. A
natural cave leads to the dais
holding the auralith within, the
sole auralith whose location is
known to the aegyl.

| Rendezvous Round Back - Fane
Of Tehp Qul |
|                               
| After saving the aegyl, the
party heads for the shrine
holding the auralith, | | but a
watch has already bee posted
outside! How does Vaan plan to
sneak |
| past?                         
|                               
|                               
| !--Sneak into the temple; Vaan
must survive--! |
|                               
| This is a...different kind of
mission. I won't bother listing
the enemies | | and their stats.
You shouldn't try to take them
on. PLEASE, PLEASE remember | |
that there are several Viera
archers throughout who will cast
vanishing | | spells on
themselves. Try your best to
memorize where they are before
you |
| start moving.                 
|                               
| Secondly, some people forget
about Vaan's abilities. I had on
his Sprint | | Shoes when I did
this, also you can set his
Gambit under Sprint. This will |
| help you. I'm sure a lot of
people will be tempted by the
treasure chests | | sprinkled
throughout, but as you can see
at the bottom here you'll find |
| better things soon enough.
Still, I managed to do this
after casting Sprint. |
|                               
| If you don't want treasure you
can make a dash towards the
entrance and the | | mission
will be completed. If you want
all three of the chests then you
will | | probably be caught, so
be prepared to lose some health.
If you did what I | | told you
by completing everything else
(aka training) up until this
point, |
| you will last.                
|

| So as far as the first half of
this goes...the Judge will
approach you fast. | |
Therefore, it is probably better
to stay where you are and wait.
This way | | you won't have
other enemies to deal with. Then
we need to take care of the | |
rank III Esper Shiva. She is
weak to fire, so...keep that in
mind. The other | | enemies will
approach throughout, so I would
wait until the coast is all | |
clear before approaching Shiva.
Save Kyte's Firaga spell. |

Gijuk will give a tip, saying
that the Judge of Wings went to

means. At least we can leave
this place now.

Chapter 3 Complete!

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
       400 - Chapter Four
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

We begin this chapter with Tomaj
showing you around the newly
accessible Sky Saloon. There are
four shops around here. Check
their sections of my walkthrough
to learn more. When you can
control Vaan, fiddle with the
Ring of Pacts.

Now let's look around. To the
left is Penelo's shop, above her
is Llyud's shop where you can
purchase materials for crafting,
right of him is a funky little
dude called Namingway who can
rename the airship, to the right
of THAT is Cu Sith's craft shop,
and below is Tomaj's weapon, etc
shop. If you speak to Lluyd
after Tomaj explains what he's
doing there he'll say something
funny ( I thought so anyway).

These are the new weapons etc.
he has that you shouldn't right
now: Flametongue, Rod of
Lightning, Rod of Ice, Ruby
Chestplate, Bard's Tunic,
Hermit's Robes, Survival Vest,
Steel Gorget, Battle Boots, and
the Goblin Pouch. I recommend
you at least buy the pouch.

The material shop Lluyd runs
sells low-grade only right now.
You shouldn't have just the Pink
Silver and Peridot at this
point. Don't buy anything
though, you will be desperate
later on to sell all the crap...

I will also advise you to begin
crafting things. Certain
missions will only unlock after
you have crafted a certain
number of weapons, in addition
to there being a chapter
requirement. So start now. Craft
everything you can.

For now, we head back to the
Fane...

| We've got quite a few
different types of weaknesses
here. Two leaders here | | are
weak towards lightning, so maybe
stick with that. Take care of
the Time | | Mage, and a shot of
Firaga should take care of the
Gnoam easily. The enemy | | has
a habit of running away after
you do a little damage to them,
so try not | | to chase after
and just focus on the task at
hand. They'll get theirs soon |
| enough. Don't forget to
fortify Espers continuously.
Other than that this is |
| a standard battle here.

same that the crystal will be.
The | | hardest enemies are weak
to fire, so use Kytes there and
any Esper with a | | nature of

| !--Destroy the enemy soul
crystal; your soul crystal must

|                               
| This is a very tough battle at
this stage of the game. First,
take care of | | the enemy right
above you. Then go east and
attack there, sealing everything
| | on the way and getting the
scavenge items. Then return to
the first summon | | gate and
defend, gathering your troops
again and fortifying them. Make
sure | | you have plenty of
White Hares for this one. There
are a variety of natures | | but
the majority are weak towards
fire. Summon Espers that
correspond. |
|                               
| When you reach the top things
become a bit tricky. Try to
reach the third | | gate as soon
as you can after taking care of
the first wave of Golem. You | |
need to seal that off. After
that, recover again and rush
over to the soul | | crystal.
Don't bother trying to seal the
last gate. This will probably
take | | several tries. Utilize
Kytes' abilities as much as
possible. Keep summoning | |
fresh Espers to aid you in the
fight. |
|                               
| If I were you, I would summon
Bombs and Lamia for this battle.
Not only are | | the Lamia fire
in nature, but they can confuse
enemies. As for Bombs, you | |
can self-destruct them once you
reach the third summon gate and
quickly | | summon them again.
Very handy... |

| I hope you all read the enemy
info correctly--the Minotaur is
at twice the | | level of
everything else. Sooo proceed
with extreme caution. Obviously
units | | that are flyers will
be of big help. First take care
of the Rock Wolf to the | |
right and gather the items found
nearby. Once you kill the Green
Wyrms...a | | lone Minotaur
should approach, which triggers
a whoooole group of them to | |
shortly follow. All I can say is
that it reallly helps to have at
least one | | type of rank II
flyers here. I also really like
Lamia to confuse them and I | |
also had Golem to immobilize. |
|                               
| That aside it should be fairly
straightforward...there is
another group of | | high
leveled Minotaur next to the
timber, but I just avoided
those, so try | | not to attract
their attention as some of your
Esper will be down for the | |
count. Gather the remaining
materials. |

|_______________________________

Acquire an Esper or two from the
Auracite you should have just
gained. There are no more of
Tomaj's side missions, so now we
need to tackle a storyline
mission. Board the airship and
travel to the skysea.

Port Marilith: Breathtaking port
overlooking the skysea. It is
customary for the aegyl to
travel the skysea by ship rather
than fly, and the port bustles
with travelers.

Make your way over to Rikken and
speak with him. Once the
dialogue is over, return to
Penelo and speak with her. More
cutscenes, and it seems as
though you will be participating
in the contest. Now canoe over
to:

Isshu, Jewel Of The SkySea:
Island paradise where aegyl
crossing the skysea often
sojourn. The crystal-blue waters
and shimmering white beaches
offer welcome to the weary
wayfarer.

| Yeah...the main thing to worry
about is grabbing the treasure.
The others | | should be okay--
in fact, they'll be your rivals
for this. What will REALLY | |
help is to step back and let
them spend the time opening the
Mimic chests | | and making them
fight those things. I would also
suggest splitting up into | |
two separate groups at some
point. Maybe one person mine the
bones while the | | other grabs
the treasure while the neutrals
are still standing quietly. Also
| | it's pretty obvious Vaan's
Sprint ability and his Sprint

| handy for this mission.       
|                               
| I went like this: took the

to where Rikken's | | chest is
while another scavenged, then
one person picked up the Pure
Silver | | while another (Vaan
with Sprint) went South for the
Beastlord bone and then | |
mined the crystal. And then my

it. Hopefully at some point a

| | you can summon the hares (if

the bones if | | a group has a
chance. Recuperate and make a
final attack against the enemy |

go in order from start to

cast Vaan's sprint or wear his
Sprint Shoes to get the
treasure. | | The battle tactics
will soon become clearer once
Ba'Gamnan joins the fray. | |
You must kill him as well. Have
Lluyd or Vaan get the west
treasure since | | they are the
fastest. Then send other party
members east, then quickly up to
| | nab that treasure as well.
Lamia will soon spawn once you
approach Ba'Gamnan | | so try to
take care of them with Kytes'
Blizzaga. |

| Yeah so your three favorite
allies will be helping you here.
Personally I | | went northwest
first, but that is up to you.
Capture the gate and take the |
| time to fortify. I also
summoned an extra hare. Don't
worry about where your | |
allies are this time, as now
they will follow you. At some
point Ba'Gamnan's | | cronies
will appear. The Sagittarius are
annoying, so consider a ground |
| Esper like Golem or something.
Just focus on Ba'Gamnan and
perhaps Penelo | | should cast
her magick that increases
strength. |

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

For the time being you cannot
access the saloon or any of the
newest of Tomaj's missions. Add
a new Esper to your collection
if you can. Three new areas will
become available. Although you
cannot return to the airship you
can still buy things from Tomaj
at the camp. New equipment is
available. Let's begin a Melee
to start things out.

Zwaua Rainwood: Rare and
splendid Yarhi crawl through the
dense tropical brush in the
hidden depths of the wood. They
do not readily welcome
outsiders.

| We have a general weakness

for now and try to | | capture
the lone summon gate. A bunch of
tortoise are walking around in a
| | circle. Be careful, as some
Aquarius will surprise you. As a
side note, at | | the beginning
you can also have your flyers go
over to take the summon gate | |
as a bit of a shortcut. Don't
need to, though. Make your way
back to Titan | | after grabbing
the scavenge items, etc. Prep
everyone with Penelo's dances |
| and attack. Vaan's Quickening
might appear, so take advantage
if it does. |

A new area is now available on

Now we head back to camp.

Tomaj's Camp: Jungle clearing
where the Galbana came to rest.
Tomaj looks after the camp and
diligently tills the soil,
preparing for the worst.

|                               
| Yeah, this one is tough.
Basically what you need to do is
stay in the middle | | of the
area and wait for the monsters
to come to you (or you can go to
them | | if there's time, but
that isn't recommended for too
many occasions). Use all | | of
Kytes's spells when he can. Have
Penelo increase magick and
strength. You | | must
continuously fortify Espers and
summon new ones. Heal Velis if
he is | | under attack and
never, ever leave him for too
long. If all else fails, try | |
to have Vaan's Quickening ready
once the Great Malboro appears.

| Ugh...no Penelo for this
mission. That means a few
things. First, you cannot | |
forget about the various
foraging points throughout the
battlefield. They | | will give
back much needed HP. Secondly,
you should dismiss at least one
or | | two of your Espers and
replace them with a White Hare
(Carbuncle?). Lastly, | | The
Judge of Wings will NOT attack
you, so long as you do not
approach her. | | Wait until
Velis comes towards you. If you
fight the lesser enemies with |
| Vaan a lot you might just gain
his Quickening. You don't even
need to take | | away all his
health, the battle will end
before that point. There is no
way | | to take back Penelo's
health unless you summon a
healing thing. Watch her | |
carefully because the enemies
will keep trying to attack her.

A cutscene begins. Tomaj is
excited because the airship has
finally been fixed. How he knew
how to fix an airship that is
from another place I'll never
know.

Chapter 5 Complete!

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
       600 - Chapter Six
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Talk to Cu Sith and Tomaj at the
beginning of this chapter. If
you've been crafting things Cu
will have a new mission for you
to complete. Tomaj will also
have one for you. If you talk
with Lluyd he'll mention the
first price discount of the
game. Things will now cost five
percent less than before.
Lastly, speak with Penelo to
unlock yet another mission
(involving food).

Go to the Bridge for a cutscene.
After that, launch the airship.
There are many different things
we can do at this point, but
right now I wish to have those
pesky melee missions out of the
way.

Time to move on. There's a newly
unlocked area by the skysea.

Oghu, the Veiled Isle:
Mysterious island revealed by
the skysea's destruction. The
aegyl dare not approach for fear
they should disturb the Lord of
the Seas said to dwell thereon.

Gee, I wonder who this Lord of

| In case you haven't noticed,
most of the enemies are weak
towards lightning. | | So it
would be to your great advantage
to change your Esper lineup so
that | | a few are
more...lightning-y. Anyway, I'd
go after the Seeq first if I
were | | you. He'll cause more
trouble later. Seal off his
gate. Then go after the | |
Ninja, who will be in the area,
and the Warmage, who will
approach. Go to | | her gate and
seal that off too, collecting
the crystal items. You probably
| | have noticed by now that
Flyers have an easy time cutting
across paths. So I | | used this
to send Filo and Lluyd to
scavenge the northwest bones.
After you | | seal off the other
western gate this should become
easier. Don't forget to | |
fortify. Thunder-nature Espers,
again, will really, really help
you. |

Okay, it is at this point in the
game that I would recommend
selling certain low grade
materials. Otherwise you'll end
up discarding them with no money
back. Sell enough so you have
only 4 or 5 of something (the
low grade). After that go a bit
northeast of the skysea.

Underfane of Huin Qul: Sister of
the shrine destroyed with the
skysea. The balance of auracite
held within the shrines--one of
fire, one of water-- preserved
the balance of the skysea. With
one lost, the skysea could not
long last.

For the moment, if you choose to

equipping them. This is because
we'll be facing a water enemy

then. On the other hand, you can
craft them and equip it for
other fights, but just be sure
to switch for another thing if
you are not that powerful.

|                               
| This is a very, very hard
battle. It is also the first I
recommend using | | Carbuncles.
If you fail within the first few
tries I would recommend going |
| to different missions
available and leveling up some
more. Set both Penelo's | |
Raise and Lluyd's Revive as
gambits! And be sure to have
Penelo cast her | | spells that
increase strength and magick
right before you encounter
Ultima. | | And if you attack
behind Ultima you will be able
to avoid her very powerful | |
attack, although that is very
hard to maneuver. My recommended
Espers are: | | Shivan (meh),
Cuchulainn, Carbuncle, and
Siren. The last one can be
whatever | | you want, really.
Don't bother with Vaan's
Quickening, there's not enough |
| time, usually. It'll only
happen if you can survive for
long enough, or if | | you equip
the Germinas Boots (maybe,
haven't tried that). |
|                               
| Lastly, there is one "trick" I
have learned that can help you
greatly. There | | are two
summoning gates to either side.
Ahead of the downward-right one
is a | | rock. Hopefully you can
see what I'm talking about. If
you stand just so | | behind it
then Ultima's attacks will not
be able to reach you. Obviously
| | you'll need to use Melee
people as bait while your Ranged
fighters hammer | | away. This
can take a little time to
perfect. I managed to beat
Ultima using | | characters in
the 27 level range with this
trick. |

choose. Reform your Espers to

If you want to | | pause and

Ugh, the blade we picked up is

| Yep, this is where that

of Fire-natured Espers. Make
your way slowly around the paths
while | | hopefully building
Vaan's Quickening. When it comes
time to face Hashmal | | have
Lluyd Jump and Wyvern/Kytes
perform their far-away fire
moves to get | | rid of a good
chunk of the Golems' HP. Also
once you see Hashmal approaching
| | have Penelo perform her
usual dances to increase magick
and strength. You | | will
probably lose lots of Espers but
it's not as bad as Ultima. |

Cool, we now have Lluyd's
Quickening. And Hashmal is
unlocked on the ring. Neat.
Well, that's it for optional
missions right now. We've put
off the inevitable. It's time to
tackle those storyline things.

Heaven's Vigil: The aegyl stage
their watch of the Ymir Qul from
this quiet village. Legend holds
that the sacred mountain lies at
the foot of the heavens, the
stairway fallen aegyl must
ascend to reach the afterlife.

Enter the place and speak with
Fran. A short dialogue will
occur. After this move to the
next place, which is...

The Ymir Qul Range: Holy peaks
higher than aegyl wings can
soar. Jagged skystone claws at
the sky along its twisting
paths, while sheer cliffs stand
their silent watch, unforgiving
of those who would trespass.

Levi) and | | also an extra
Carbuncle. Have Vaan go after
the pesky white mage while the |

Lamia. Vaan will probably die,
so have Lluyd use | | Revive. If
you are lucky the tide should
turn and you'll defeat the
Bangaa. | | Capture the gate and
QUICKLY move back to where Fran
is. After that you will | | be
in the clear, for the most part.
Just concentrate on the Ninja
and Time | | Mage while casting
Water spells like crazy. |

Yay, Fran joined your party!
You're probably wondering right
now whether or not you should
kick someone else out and fit
her in. Well I'd say yes, and
I'd make it Filo. She doesn't
really have anything special
going on for her.

| Lightning Espers are of course
recommended. If you lead them
away you won't | | really need

| This is an...interesting
battle. Not only do you have
Fran/Balthier to worry | |
about, but that pesky Ba'Gamnan
guy showed up. Since those two
hate each | | other, they WILL
fight one another. This means
the best way to deal with his |
| team is to send Espers over to
the left under Lluyd's Vanishga
spell. The | | best is a rank
III Esper. Lead Ba'Gamnan over
to where Balthier is. After he |
| is out of the way you're free
to take his summoning gate.
After that it's a | | matter of
dealing with Balthier and Fran.
Vaan should obtain his
Quickening | | somewhere in
there, so make use of it. Lots
of Sagittarius will show up. If
| | you're not comfortable
fighting that area yet send more
Espers up to clear | | the field
for you. And summon at least
four Carbuncles just in case. |

More scenes follow. Things
become a little confusing.

Chapter 6 Complete!

    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
      700 - Chapter Seven
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

The End of Dreams: Currents of
dense Mist coil and whirl here,
where Vaan first awoke in this
realm. Vespterine light stirs a
longing for home.

Lots and lots of scenes. What
you need to do and where you
need to move is pretty self-
explanatory. Watch Penelo,
Kytes, and Filo. Move to where
Lluyd is and speak to him.
Approach Balthier/Fran. After
another short scene approach the
Alraune. The world map will
appear. Approach the left area.

Illusion's Home: Waves of Mist
radiate from this secluded
spring, lapping at the blooming
flowers of remembrance. Herein
all creatures revisit their
home. It is the place of birth
and return for all Yarhi.

Glad to get that out of the way.
Strangely even though you are
"supposedly" separated from your
companions you can still fight
alongside them. Oh well. Now go
to the right on the map.

The Neverwood: Dark forest of
the Yarhi where shadow and shade
chase through perpetual
twilight. Shifting trees and
softly flickering stones animate
this surreal wood.

I'm happy we're finished with

After several scenes the whole

airship. There's no time to
think, though. Gotta fight one
more battle in this chapter. Go
around the Sky Saloon and buy
things if you wish. I also took
this opportunity to sell my
excess materials. Go to the
bridge and speak with Balthier.

      800 - Chapter Eight
    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

A royal airship will approach.
Lolz who could it be!? Once you
gain control, head up to where
the Leviathan is. If you touch
that airship you can descend
back down to Ivalice. Finally,
all your party members are
accounted for.

Talk to everyone on the airship.
Penelo will have another mission
available once you speak with
her. So will Cu and Nono. Lluyd
will offer a discount and fresh
materials. Tomaj has some new
equipment worth looking at.

Let's begin with a simple
summoning melee.

Balthier. Neat. Also equip his
armor because it's probably
better than what you have. Let's
acquire one more scion before we

take care of the archer so she
doesn't destroy your soul

become a little tricky. You'll

Once back at the airship, speak

unlock for you to visit. Now
speak with Cu...she should tell
you about a new Tomaj mission if

Now that we've taken care of
this we can concentrate on
mandatory missions. I like to
finish Giza Plains because it's
annoying.

Giza Plains: Savannah to the
south of the Royal City of
Rabanastre, currently in the
Dry. Members of the Rabanstre
watch have been dispatched to
patrol the plains amid reports
of Yarhi sightings.

| This battle is as hard or as

That's because the | | informant
you're looking for is the one to
the north. Sometimes he will go
| | to the right a little bit.
Scramble over there (Vaan with

recommended). If you find the

not...the | | Yarhi will attack
and eventually kill him. |

Let's look at the new place now.

Roda Volcano: Active volcano
that dominates the Bervenian
countryside. Not so much as a
weed grows in its barren shadow.
The races of Ivalice have long
avoided this desolate wasteland.

| This is very hard. The zombies
will always respawn, so don't
bother with | | trying to beat
them down. Also in case you were
wondering, my rank III Esper | |
was Tiamat, because he is ranged
so he won't get in the way, and
also since | | he knows Mighty
Guard, which is very helpful.
Capture the second summoning | |
gate after fighting your way
through the crowd. Whenever you
feel there is a | | brief lull
in the enemies, head over to
Zalera. He doesn't have as much
HP | | as you'd suspect. As for
your party...you need at LEAST
Penelo and Lluyd so | | that
they can revive people. I like
Kytes for his abilities and
quickening, | | which can wipe
out the Vampyr in front of
Zally. Basch is mandatory, so
the | | last character is up to
you (Vaan's quickening is good).
The rest is luck. |

| or Lluyd (or both) to fly over
to the treasure chests while
hopefully | | avoiding enemies.
You won't have time for it
otherwise. Also do the usual of
| | having a flyer sneak over to
the crystal from the backside.
As for Famfrit, | | have Shell
ready. Lightning things are
great here. |

Yay. Also Fammy is now available
on the ring, so check that out.
Equip the new items. Okay, now
it's finally time for all the
mandatory missions of the
chapter.

Gates of Shattered Time: Gate
before the Keep of Forgotten
Time. Long ages have weathered
the stone gate, but its glory is
undiminished. The Mist drifting
about the gate projects
illusions of times long past.

| I recommend taking the middle
gate first. Things will just
become chaotic | | otherwise.
You NEED to take all the gates
to make this mission run as best
| | as possible. I suggest the
center, then southeast, then
southwest, then | | northeast,
then northwest. For me Mydia
always approached me when I was
at | | the northwest gate, so
save that until the very last.
She has a move that'll | |
basically do massive damage, so
be near a gate to immediately
resummon your | | Carbuncles.
And take care of her Lamia!
They'll be a pain if left alone.
I | | summoned as many Carbuncle
as I possibly could, so you may
try that. Also, I | | recommend
have Lluyd's and Penelo's gambit
set to their revival abilities.

|_______________________________

Now that we're done with that
mission, you probably want to
take on the rest of the side
missions, right? Wrong. You're
not ready yet. The easiest fight
is the one against Bahamut and
the like, and there's no way you
can win that battle unless
you're a) really, really lucky,
or b) you've trained and crafted
the best weapons you can at this
point. I think we should opt for
the latter choice.

First you should concentrate on
gathering the highest grade
craft materials, so that you can
train simultaneously. Don't
waste time with weapons for
people who already have their
ultimates, though. Here's a list
of what you should have at this
point for your characters:
  - Kytes (if crafted--to me tha
  - Filo's Vortex
  - Balthier's Formalhaut
  - Fran's Sagittarius
  - Ashe's Volcano

That's not to say something you
craft cannot turn out to be more
powerful, however. So experiment
around with things. For right
now, I'd make the best that you
can with Cu's Forbidden Grimoire
book. So train while hunting
down materials in various
places. See materials section
for more details.

I'd also recommend double-
checking Tomaj's shop for any
armor you may need to purchase
that is stronger than what you
may have currently.

|                               
| I only listed the starting
rank III Esper, but there are
lots more. As we | | can see,
the regular Espers have fire-
weaknesses, so exploit that. I
used | | Bomb, Shivan, Balasa,
Carbuncle of course, and Zalera
because...I just like | | him, I
dunno. Next, let's talk
characters. Basch is amazing
with his Shining | | Ray move.
It'll pwn everything. I
recommend that for a gambit.
Kytes is also | | very helpful,
I set his gambit to Charge and
then mainly kept my eye on him |
| and what spells he could cast.
Penelo and Lluyd should both be
here, with | | their gambits set
to their Revival abilities. The
last char is up to you (I | |
used Balthier because it's not
good to have more than one melee
character, | | they take up too
much space and waste time). |
|                               
| First I recommend taking the
southern-east gate. After that,
summon the rank | | III and
proceed as fast as you can to
the west gate. Take care of the
Goblin | | things there
(shouldn't be hard). And take
the gate. Then the Shivan group
| | should approach. After that,
take care of the Carbuncle/Golem
group (do NOT | | approach the
Titan group yet, go around). If
you don't, the Carbuncles are |
| much more of a pain later.
When you feel ready, Shell,
Protect, and raise |
| Strength and Magick.          
|                               
| BEFORE you defeat Titan,
capture the gate. This is very,
very important. And | | then
resummon when necessary. Fortify
if you get the chance. Ramuh,
Shiva, | | Ifrit, and Bahamut
will appear, in that order. At
some point you should have | |
quickenings appearing. Kytes's
is very, very helpful for
Bahamut's group of | | minions.
Carbuncles are annoying, try to
take them out. And keep your own
| | supply of Carbuncles up.
Fortify them before all the
others. |
|                               
| Lastly, there's a little trick
I'd like to mention to you.
Titan will NOT | | approach you
before you attack him. So this
means you can be a little sneaky
| | using Lluyd. Have your whole
party stay near the left gate.
Then have Lluyd | | attack using
his jump move and then RUN back
to the party. Titan should walk
| | over to you here. If Lluyd
is under immobilize, have Penelo
close to get rid | | of that.
Being in this location can save
you precious seconds of heal and
| | recover time. I chose the
left gate because Ramuh is not
that bad, unlike | | Shiva. Have
Kytes be a little daring in the
beginning by leaving him under |
| attack for a short while to
build his quickening for
Bahamut's group. |
|                               
| When it was all said and done
I managed to win with a level 55
party (barely | | though). I
don't recommend that however,
try to train at least to 60. |

| ...It's too bad we don't have
any dark masks to nullify that
Final Eclipse | | move this
time...sigh. Well, a lot of my
character strategy is similar to
| | Bahamut's fight--gambits and
all. Check that so I don't
repeat myself. |
|                               
| Now the important thing to
remember here is that Zodiark
will never actively | | seek you
out and attack, so the first
part of this battle should be
pretty | | obvious in capturing
the gates. Then, stay in the
middle and wait for the | |
enemies to approach you. Use
this time to obtain quickenings
and fortify the | | Espers (I
used Bahamut for this fight,
naturally). I also recommend
Golems | | and Lamias. This is a
matter of personal preference
though. |
|                               
| Now onto Zodiark himself. My
strategy was as follows: have
Bahamut be part | | of Basch's
group. Then summon as many
Golems/whatever under him so he
has a | | total of eight things
(maybe one Carbuncle as well).
Then while the party is | | in
the center, send Bahamut and
anything else Basch has in his
group to | | Zodiark. Right
before they attack, have him
perform his quickening which can
| | make them totally immune to
damage for a short period. While
they are there | | and attacking
things (hopefully mainly
Zodiark), his quickening will
quickly | | build again. Rinse
and repeat. If he doesn't obtain
it again right away, you | |
only need to simply resummon and
continue it again. Don't bring
the main | | party near him.
Using this strategy I defeated
him around level 60. |

| 1005 - Midlight's Deep |______
|                               
| Well of Whispered Oaths |
|                               
| The dungeon extends untold
reaches beneath the keep. The
creature that waits | | in its
depths is said to possess the
power to defy the gods
themselves. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Destroy the enemy soul
crystal; your soul crystal must
survive--! |
|                               
| This makes things hard because
there are so many enemy leaders.
What I did | | is I took the
first gate to the left, then
killed the center leader, and |
| then I made a mad dash for
their crystal. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat all enemies; at
least one ally must survive--! |
|                               
| No summon gates here, so
replace the rank III. I chose
Golems and Shivars, | | but
other things like Lamia can work
well. Great Malboro will spawn
in the | | center, first one,
then two, and so on. I cast
Shell each time (and also | |
Bravery) before taking the bombs
on just in case. You'll need to
move quick | | around the place.
It doesn't matter which section
you chose first. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat the War-chief; at
least one ally must survive--! |
|                               
| Uhh, this is hard. Your team
will be separated and you'll
need to battle | | your way to
the Seeq leader. So basically
all I did was ignore everyone
else | | and simply pressed X
and dashed over to the Seeq.
Seemed to work well. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Survive the enemy
onslaught; at least one ally
must survive--! |
|                               
| No gates again. Get rid of the
rank III. Odin will walk in a
specific path | | around the
circle. Whatever you do, do NOT
save him until the very end.
Kill | | him when there are no
enemies around. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Destroy the enemy soul
crystal; your soul crystal must
survive--! |
|                               
| Here we face off against our
characters' "evil twins" or
something. They are | |
identical to your leaders in
every way. I had one leader stay
behind to take | | care of the
soul crystal (I chose Basch) and
the rest made their way around |
| to the enemy soul crystal.
Summon lots of Carbuncle and
this should work. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Open all the treasure
chests; at least one ally must
survive--! |
|                               
| You may only have three
leaders (I picked my same from
Gilgamesh's battle, | | Basch,
Kytes, and Penelo). So basically
the things around the area will
be | | patrolling around and you
need to avoid them as best you
can. You absolutely | | MUST
avoid Bahamut. As you can
imagine. Also, the northeast
group of Espers | | is hiding a
treasure chest since their
number obscures it on the map. |
|

| !--Capture the summoning
gates; your soul crystal must
survive--! |
|                               
| Here's how I did this one. I
had one person capture the
northeast gate while | | the
rest stood near the soul crystal
and defended it. The important
thing to | | remember is that
the Tricksters have the
capability to cast Vanishing
spells | | on themselves and
their group. This means you'll
have to keep a mental note | |
of how many Tricksters you've
killed. After I had one gate
captured and some | | leaders
started to go down, I had
someone go to the other gates
while the | | rest stood guard.
And you'll have to be good about
standing guard because if | |
not they only need one chance to
destroy the crystal (especially
the ones | | that can create the
flameball, pay special attention
to them). |
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat all enemies; at
least one ally must survive--! |
|                               
| You'll need to have Espers
that are immune to confusion.
This means anything | | that is
the lightning nature. This isn't
too hard, but it'll be much
easier | | to have Penelo's
quickening when the wolves come
out. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat all enemy leaders;
at least one ally must
survive--! |
|                               
| No gates to be seen. You can
breathe easy with this battle,
because you can | | actually
take your time for once. I
highly suggest going
counterclockwise | | for this
circle, because then the enemy
leaders will be exposed. The
last | | two groups will
approach you, so think carefully
about which ones you want | |
left. I suggest the Ninja and
Champion. I recommend taking
care of the Aegyl | | and like,
then going in the center, then
kill the Viera, then the Moogle
at | | his back so you might
have a chance of surviving him.
|
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat Yiazmat; at least
one ally must survive--! |
|                               
| It figures this guy would show
up. Sigh. As in FFXII, he knows
a move called | | Death Strike,
which is pretty self
explanatory. So have a revival
gambit | | ready. Surprisingly,
he's at only level 70. He's also
weak to ground, so I'd | | keep
that in mind. Now before you
freak out, you may use the same
strategy | | we used for
Zodiark, with Basch using his
shield. This time, summon
Zodiark, | | plenty of Golems,
and one or two Carbuncle. Your
other characters should die | |
probably, but that's alright.
Lastly, you should probably
focus on killing | | the four
surrounding Carbuncle of his
before attacking him. |

| !--Defeat Feolthanos; at least

|                               
| The enemy's level depends on
how much you've completed the
game. If you have | | 100%,
they'll all be at level 99.
Yeeeah. Here's what I recommend:
The Wing | | Wraiths are Melee,
so have Wyverns in your troupe.
Melee Espers will do you | | no
good for this fight. Then
Carbuncles and Bombs and one
other random rank | | I Esper.
You can go with Rabbits if
you're daring but I would not
suggest to | | do that at all.
Then the rank III should
probably be Zodiark if you have
him | | or Bahamut if you have
him, and if not then a ranged
rank III of your choice | |
(it's best to have at least one
good ranged...you'll see why
soon). |
|                               
| Character gambits should look
something like this: Basch's set
to Shell (at | | least in the
beginning when the right arm is
still there), Lluyd's set to | |
either Revive or Jump, Vaan's
set to Dervish, Penelo's to
either Holy or her | | Raise
ability, Ashe's to Comet,
Balthier's to Tri-Shot, Kytes's
to Charge | | and then watch
when his abilities become
available, Filo and Fran...well
| | let's just face it, by now
you should know not to use them
ever. |
|                               
| So the first thing you need to
do is take out the arm with the
magic staff | | that can hurt
you regardless of where you are
on the battlefield. When the | |
battle starts, summon two
Carbuncles/Rabbits under Basch
(USE him for this, | | you'll be
sorry if you don't) and as many
Wyverns as you can after that.
You | | should probably summon
them from the left gate, not
right. Next take care of | | the
Wing Wraiths that will approach
or who are already in groups. |
|                               
| Piece of advice--do NOT
continue to attack his arms when
the Wing Wraiths | | show up.
Stop and take care of them
before their number becomes too
much to | | handle. Keep careful
tabs on your Esper count.
FORTIFY...and keep Basch's | |
Shell gambit up when the right
arm decides to attack. Use
Lluyd's quickening | | as much
as possible. Once that arms
falls, this fight becomes much
more | | manageable for now.
Once you start attacking the
left arm, you should change | |
Basch's gambit to Protect,
probably. You won't need to
worry about magickal | | spells
for now. Continue the pain until
both arms are gone. |
|                               
| The core is left now...things
become tricky. Here is where
Basch's Shield | | quickening
will start to come into play.
Set his gambit back to Shell
first | | of all. Have Espers
under his command completely
fortified before you make | |
them approach Feolthanos. Send
about three Carbuncles up, the
rank III, and | | the Wyverns.
Do NOT send Basch up with them
because it's too risky. |
|                               
| After this you should know the
strategy by now...before Basch's
group is | | attacked, use his
quickening so they are immune to
damage. Have them attack | | the
core while the Wing Wraiths
pummel them to gain Basch's
quickening again | | for you to
repeat. Meanwhile, your main
party should be clear on the
other | | side of the room, away
from the middle and by a gate.
Bahamut will appear on | | the
top of the stairs once
Feolthano's HP has been drained
60%. He will be | | 30 levels
higher than you. So have Basch's
group turn their attention to
the | | dragon now while he
continues to use his quickening.
Then once he's gone, | | return
your concentration to the core
and it won't be long. |
|                               
| Another way to do this is to
have your ranged fighters stand
by the stairs | | and damage him
from there while not being hit
by his beam...I don't prefer | |
this method though, because it's
hard to get them to stand there
and hit him | | at the same time
and Bahamut kinda messes that
up. |
|                               
|                               
| !--Defeat Feolthanos; Vaan
must survive--! |
|                               
| Yes, there's more. Now Vaan
must fight him alone. Which
sucked for me since | | I never
used Vaan after my main party
arrived on the scene. Anyway,
running | | away from Feolthanos
won't do any good, you need to
battle with him before | | your
allies appear to help. Once they
do, get Vaan out of the way
(even if | | he's not
underleveled, you don't want to
risk him being killed). This
isn't | | a part to worry about
or anything, the allies will
arrive only after Vaan | | has
lost a certain percentage of his
HP. |

This part of the airship first
opens up at the start of Chapter
4. There are many useful things
here, and you should talk to
people frequently (it can open
up new missions by doing so).
Let's examine the different
places:

081 - Material Shop

This section includes at what
point certain materials become
available to buy, how much they
cost, their grade, type,
description, and where you can
find them. In other words, I'm
putting all this stuff in one
section. After each mission I
list the possible scavenge items
you could have gotten, so also
consider using the search
feature to find what you're
looking for.

Note: More in-depth stuff on
these materials can be found
under Equipment.

091 - FAQs for Revenant Wings

Q: My Esper troupe ranks won't
move up. Two of them are staying
at rank I. What do I need to do
to fix this?

  A: Once you unlock at least 3 
spots will upgrade to rank II.
Two of the spots will always
stay at rank I. When you unlock
a rank III Esper, one spot will
upgrade to a rank III. So when
you have Espers of all ranks
there should be two rank I
spots, two rank II spots, and a
rank III spot in your troupe.

Q: Should I use low grade
materials and save my higher
grade materials when I craft
things, or should I ignore the
low grade and use the higher
ones?

  A: It depends how much you sca
the higher grade quality.
Generally though, it's okay to
at least go medium. See above to
know exactly how many times
you'll need a certain group of
materials.

Q: I've heard that there is a
New Game+ mode in Revenant
Wings. Is this true?

  A: No, once you finish the gam
screen will show like all the
other Final Fantasy games.

Q: What is the significance
behind the craft master's
questions?

  A: That has to do with the ass
a bonus in strength or agility,
etc). I won't make a list of all
the questions and the bonuses
that go with them, but just so
you know that's what it means.

Q: Does Penelo EVER sell
anything in her shop?

  A: Not that I have seen. You d
missions, though.

Q: Which characters should I use
in my party?

  A: Well for awhile it won't ma
deal with anyway. Do NOT use
Ba'Gamnan in your party when he
is available since he'll be gone
soon from the group. After this,
try to really spread out your
attack types. I leave it up to
you what you value more. Also,
this of course depends on the
attack type of your enemies.
Generally though: Basch, Ashe,
Lluyd, Penelo, and Kytes is my
recommendation. Ashe only for
Comet, really, and Combustion.
Her gambit sorta sucks. :/

Q: Which gambits for ____ player
should I use?

  A: See above. It depends on wh
situation you are in.

Q: What happens if you complete
all the mandatory and optional
missions?

  A: When you reach a game compl
additional ending. Note that the
final confrontation, if you
choose to do this, will have
enemies at level 99. Also keep
in mind that some missions will
NOT become available after
awhile, so be sure to do
everything.

094 - Disclaimer/Legal Stuff

It was very painstaking to write
stuff for the missions down.
With this in mind, I'd be very
unhappy if someone takes this
without asking. If one of you
readers out there see it in
another place, notify me
immediately. This guide will
only be found on Gamefaqs.com.

So if you see this walkthrough
there, that's okay. Otherwise,
it hasn't been authorized for
anywhere else. Thank you, and I
hope this guide has helped.
