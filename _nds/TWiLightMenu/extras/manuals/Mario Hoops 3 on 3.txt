 *| Introduction [A.00]|*
 *+-----------------------------

Hello. I'm Devicho, the author
of this guide. This is my first
FAQ, so I apologize if the
quality is lower than expected.
I hope this guide can aid you in
some way.

 *| Game Information [B.00]|*
 *+-----------------------------

Mario Hoops 3 on 3 is a game
created by Nintendo and Square
Enix. It is another entry in the
Mario Sports line of games.

+------------------------------+
| Basics                 [B.01]|
+------------------------------+

A normal game in Mario Hoops 3
on 3 is 2 periods long, each
period lasting 2:30. Scoring is
different than a normal
basketball game. A regular
basket inside the 3-point line
is worth 20 points, a basket
from outside the 3-point line is
worth 30 points, and a special
shot is worth 40 points.
Collecting coins also boosts
your score. Each coin in your
possession when you make a
basket adds one point. You can
collect 100 coins at a time,
meaning you can earn up to 140
points in a single basket.

40 + 100 coins = 140 points.

There is one stage where even
more can be added, but I'll go
over that a little later.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *+-----------------------------

This is a little minigame with a
simple objective: collect 100
coins, and cross the finish
line. There are three stages to
play this on.


   *Peach's Castle*

A simple stage, it is an open
court with three pipes at the
finish line. Be careful,
however, as the pipes will shoot
out green shells, which will
make you drop some coins if you
get hit.

Time to beat: 0:45:00


   *Sunshine Road*

This stage has tires that rotate
around the stage, which will
flatten you and cause you to
drop coins if you come in
contact with them.

Time to beat: 0:55:00


   *Rainbow Road*

This stage is fairly random
compared to the previous two.
Fireballs will shoot up in
random areas, and Bombs from
Final Fantasy will roam around.
Coming in contact with either
will cause you to lose coins.

Time to beat: 1:00:00

 *| Character Information
  [G.00]|*
 *+-----------------------------

Here is an overview of each
playable charater in Mario Hoops
3 on 3.

There are five character types
to be based on:

All-around: No apparent
weaknesses or advantages.
 Technical: Great at shooting,
 but take a while to shoot.
  Powerful: Good defense and
  stealing, but slow.
    Tricky: Best trick moves,
    but slow dunks. Speedy: Fast
    running and dunking, but
    poor defense.

+------------------------------+
| Mario                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: All-around
 Special: Fire Shot
  Baller Name: The Jumpman

Mario's shadow looms large on
every court. The best ballers in
the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond
have come to take thier shot at
the overalled wonder. But are
they ready for his vicious Fire
Shot?

+------------------------------+
| Luigi                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: All-around
 Special: Green Fire Shot
  Baller Name: Mushroom Dynamite

The L might as well be for
"ludicrous" because that's how
you'll feel after he schools
you. He's big on defense and
bigger with the ball. Once his
Green Fire Shot gets rolling,
pack your bags. You're going
home.

+------------------------------+
| Peach                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Technical
 Special: Heart Shot
  Baller Name: 3-point Royalty

The grace of a princess shows in
Peach's 3-point stroke. When she
unleashes her Heart Shot, her
opponents can only sit in marvel
at her silky smooth shot, the
technique fit for queen in the
making.

+------------------------------+
| Daisy                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Technical
 Special: Flower Shot
  Baller Name: Cash Money Coin
  Collector

Diamonds might be a girl's best
friend, but tons of coins are a
good substitute. Daisy's speed
and quick hands help her pile up
the bling. When it's time to
cash in, you can count on her
Flower Shot every time.

+------------------------------+
| Yoshi                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: All-around
 Special: Flutter Dunk
Baller Name: Piranha Playa Hater

He's the hardest working man-er-
Yoshi on the hardwood. Wherever
the ball is, you'll find Yoshi
sweating over it. Watch out when
he drives to the hoop. His hops
are so big on his Flutter Dunk,
he levitates.

+------------------------------+
| Birdo                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: All-around
 Special: Broken Egg Shot
  Baller Name: Diamond Dino

*No bio avaliable.*

+------------------------------+
| Wario                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Powerful
 Special: Move-It Dunk
  Baller Name: Sir Stomp

Wario takes pride in his girth
and uses it to move bodies that
don't want to get moved. For
such a big-boned boy, he shows
amazing ups. For proof, look no
further than his acrobatic Move-
It Dunk, then question gravity.

+------------------------------+
| Waluigi                      |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Technical
 Special: Twist Dunk
  Baller Name: The Question

Waluigi is one weird, loud
baller. The only thing normal
about him is that his points
count the same as everyone
else's. When he sets off his
Twist Dunk, he swims through the
air and brings down a showerful
of coins.

+------------------------------+
| Bowser                       |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Powerful
 Special: Bomber Dunk
  Baller Name: The Big Shell

He's literally a monster on the
court. Bowser may not have
speed, has few friends and may
be ugly, but he can jam with
unstoppable force. Try to stand
in the way of his Bomber Dunk.
You'll be sorry.

+------------------------------+
| Bowser Jr.                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Speedy
 Special: Graffiti Shot
  Baller Name: Masked Man

Who is that masked man? He's a
vicious gamer trapped inside a
small package. Bowser Jr. will
rip out your heart with his
Graffiti Shot and make you
respect the boy as he grows up
on the court.

+------------------------------+
| Donkey Kong                  |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Powerful
 Special: Konga Dunk
  Baller Name: Dunky Monkey

Donkey Kong might be a brick
wall on defense, but you're
dreaming if you think you can
stand between him and the
basket. Is there a baller around
that doesn't fear the king's
Konga Dunk? Didn't think so.

+------------------------------+
| Diddy Kong                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Speedy
 Special: Jet Shot
  Baller Name: Diddy? No he
  didn't!

Diddy Kong's aerobatics are
nothing short of amazing. Just
when he's cornered, he pulls a
jet pack out of nowhere and
blasts into the stratosphere.
His Jet Shot will make you say,
"Diddy? No he didn't!"

+------------------------------+
| Dixie Kong                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Speedy
 Special: Cannon Shot
  Baller Name: ???

*No bio avaliable.*

+------------------------------+
| Paratroopa                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Tricky
 Special: Wing Shot
  Baller Name: ???

*No bio avaliable.*

+------------------------------+

 Special: Thriller Dunk
  Baller Name: ???

*No bio avaliable.*

+------------------------------+
| Fly Guy                      |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Tricky
 Special: Lightning Shot
  Baller Name: ???

*No bio avaliable.*

+------------------------------+
| Black Mage                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Tricky
 Special: Meteor Shot
  Baller Name: Abracadabra Kid

It doesn't take some alignment
of the stars for Black Mage to
dominate on the hardwood. He has
more than a few shots up his
sleeve, not the east of which is
his Meteor Shot, a homage to the
big rocks in the sky.

+------------------------------+
| White Mage                   |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Technical
 Special: Holy Shot
  Baller Name: The Light

She doesn't need an introduction
on the court. Everyone knows the
power of the White Mage and her
skills honed through the way of
the ancients. Shield your eyes
when she delivers her Holy Shot
if you want to see again.

+------------------------------+
| Ninja                        |
+------------------------------+

  Type: All-around
 Special: Leaf Veil
  Baller Name: Mr. Invincible

Speed, grace and power sum up
Ninja's game. To stop him, you
have to catch him, but when you
think you have him where you
want him, he really has you set
up to be the fool. His Leaf Veil
is a thing of beauty.

+------------------------------+
| Moogle                       |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Tricky
 Special: Moogle Dance
  Baller Name: Game & Watch Me!

What makes Moogle so dangerous?
Cuteness. Just when you think
you can steamroll a furry
friend, you find yourself flat
on your back. When the Moogle
Dance gets rolling, you're going
to get stepped on.

+------------------------------+
| Cactaur                      |
+------------------------------+

  Type: Speedy
 Special: 1000 Needles
  Baller Name: Stick & Sting

Cactaur is tough to guard. Not
only does he have wicked moves,
he's covered in needles. One way
or another, he'll make you pay
with pain. Stay out of his way
when he unleashes his 1000
Needles shot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *+-----------------------------
 *| Court Information [H.00]|*
 *+-----------------------------

Here is an overview of each
court accessable in Mario Hoops
3 on 3.

+------------------------------+
| Mario Stadium                |

A very basic court, no obsticles
to get in your way.

+------------------------------+

+------------------------------+
| Luigi Mansion                |

A court with ghosts flying
around. If a ghost catches the
ball, you will have to steal it
back from them.

+------------------------------+
| Daisy Garden                 |
+------------------------------+

This court is set in a beautiful
garden, with flowers everywhere.
In this stage, Petey Piranha is
the basket. If you try to dunk
while he is awake, he will bite
you, preventing you from
scoring. You can only dunk when
he is asleep, which happens
every 40~ seconds.

+------------------------------+
| Malboro Garden               |
+------------------------------+

This court is located in a
garden, with Malboros from Final
Fantasy hanging out near the
baskets. If you get too close to
them, they will attack you with
Bad Breath, which has the effect
on a Poision Mushroom.

+------------------------------+
| Wario Factory                |
+------------------------------+

Inside a gold factory setting is
this court. The court moves up
and down, stopping occasionally

the court, which can be picked
up and thrown.

| Jr. Street                   |
+------------------------------+

A court in a large city, this
court has slot machines behind
the baskets, that are activated
when you make a basket after
collecting one or more Slot
Coins. The slots can add points,
even double or triple the points
recieved from the basket you

lining up 3 Bowser Jrs. will
deduct 1000 points!

+------------------------------+
| Bowser Castle                |
+------------------------------+

A court inside Bowser's Castle.
Fireballs fly up through the
floor, and Bombs from Final

| Bloocheep Sea                |

also moves quite slowly in this
court.

+------------------------------+

A court on a pirate ship, with
very stormy seas and heavy rain.

Cactaur is unlocked in a
different way. To unlock him,
you must unlock Glare Desert,
and you will see his head
sticking out of the sand.
Dribble the ball on his head for
a while and he will pop out and
run off. From there, win the
match, and he's yours.
