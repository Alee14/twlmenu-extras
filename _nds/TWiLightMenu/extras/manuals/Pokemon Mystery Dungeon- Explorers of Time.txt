3.- WELCOME TO THIS FAQ!
--------------------------------


Hi guys! Let me introduce myself
first. I'm Carlos Knox but
mynickname is CarlosPit. I'm 15
and I live in Peru (That's why
you may find some grammar
mistakes in this guide). I'm a
huge Pokemon Fan. I've played
both Pokemon D/P and Mystery
Dungeon Series. I love both of
them. Since I enjoyed Blue
Rescue Team a lot, I decided to
buy this one. Pokemon Mystery
Dungeon Explorers of Darkness.
And, since there are no "Step by
Step" guides, I decided to make
one. In this one, you'll find
what to do in each part of the
game. So, please enjoy this
walkthrough!

Please, this is the First Time
I'm going through the game, so
be patient with me and with the
updates, because while I play I
have to take notes, so it takes
long. But don't worry, I'll give
my 100%.

5.- INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME
--------------------------------


Now I'm done with the Storyline,
I'll make this section.

If you have played Pokemon
Mystery Dungeon: Blue/Red Rescue
Team, you'll know the main
problem. YOU ARE A POKEMON! Zomg
how can this be? There must be a
reason. Maybe you have a mission
in this Pkmn world? Maybe you're
like a God? Maybe you just had
amnesia. Who knows? But in this
new Pokemon World, everything is
new to you. You don't know a
single thing about this. You
will also start noticing that
your feelings are more like a
Pokemon's one.

Intrigued? Then go buy Pokemon
Mystery Dungeon 2: Explorers of
Darkness/Time

7.- STORYLINE
--------------------------------

*Note: Instead of Saying "The
 Hero" I'll say YOU, cause in
 this
game you're the hero.*

 =============
7.1 Getting Started
 =============

Turn on your Nintendo DS and
choose New Game. Then you'll
have to answer a questionaire,
this will determine your
personality. You'll also be
asked to put your finger on the
screen so they can detect your
aura. Put either the tip of your
finger or the stylus for about
10 seconds and then stop. A
Pokemon will be assigned
according to your personality.
If you don't like what you got,
there's a nice guide in GameFaqs
about Starter Pokemons. Anyway,
back to MY guide, when you're
happy with what you got as
Starter, you'll need to choose a
Partner. This Pokemon will help
you during the story. Remember
that you can't have two pokemons
of the same type. IE: You can't
be a Charmander and have
Chimchar as your partner, since
both of them are fire types. I
chose Chimchar as Starter and
Piplup as partner. But it's up
to you.


 ========================
7.2  CHAPTER 1: STORMY SEA
 ========================

On the screen you'll see someone
talking, suddenly the screen
will turn white. When you have
vision again, you'll see a rock
that looks like a sharpedo. Then
you'll see a quiet beach.
Conclusion: you'll see pictures.
Finally, when you stop watching
images, you'll see your Main
Pokemon at the shore of the
beach. He can't even get up.
After that, you'll see your
Partner in front of a building.
He'll say something about being
brave, and stand on a grate, but
immediately step off. He's
afraid of it for some reason. He
feels dissapointed because he
even had his personal treasure
to give him courage. He's so
dissapointed he leaves to his
relax spot. What your partner
didn't know, was that Zubat and
Koffing were listening to
everything he was saying and
they heard about his personal
treasure and they decide to get
it.

Again, you'll see some images. A
beautiful beach and lots of
bubbles, these are produced by
Krabbies. Your partner appears
and says the reason why the
Krabbies appeared, which I can't
remember at the moment 'cause I
pressed A before I took note.

Your partner then realized there
was something weird by the other
side of the shore. When he goes
to check, he found you! He asks
if you're ok but you don't
reply. You finally get up and
your partner feels relieved. You
ask yourself where are you, but
you don't remember at all what
happened. Your partner will
introduce himself. He asks for
your name. That's when you have
to choose a nickname. I
reccomend using a nickname
because I don't think it would
be nice if there existed a
Pokemon with your name. I chose
Timatria. You will also say that
you're not a Pokemon! You're a
human! When you tell this to
your partner he thinks you're a
liar but later he thinks you're
saying the truth and he feels
sorry for doubting. He also says
that the Bad Pokemon number has
increased lately. Suddenly,
Zubat and Koffing hit your
partner and his treasure fell in
the ground.They pick it up and
say your partner is way too
coward to make a move and they
take off. That treasure means
everything to your partner so he
wants it back and he asks you
for help. Accept to his request
and you'll head to your first
dungeon of Explorers of
Darkness.

Notes:

*Easiest Dungeon In-Game
*Wonder Tile: Heal Stat Changes
*You can only carry 1 item
*Kill 6+ foes = Level Up
*Foes HP = Less than 20

--------------------------------

MINI-BOSS BATTLE:

Zubat + Koffing

Location: Beach Cave Pit

Strategy: It's fairly easy, just
use attacks that inflict damage.
You probably only have one
attack that inflicts dmg (Pound,
Scratch, etc).

--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level (IN):

Timatria = 5
Dinasty = 5

Level (OUT):

Timatria = 6
Dinasty = 6

------------BEACH CAVE----------


When you reach Beach Cave Pit,
you'll meet Zubat and Koffing.
They'll keep calling your
partner a coward. They intend to
sell it. Want it back? Fight for
it! After u beat them, they will
return the treasure and run
away. Your Partner will say
thanks and you guys will return
to the beach.

Once you're there, your partner
will explain you about the
treasure he has. It's called
Relic Fragment. He gives a LOT
of information, so enjoy...

He also tells you that he always
wanted to be in an exploration
team. He tried joining one, but
he chickened out. He asks you
what are you going to do. Let's
see, you're a human in a Pkmn
body... what are you supposed to
do? Maybe a picnic? NO! You have
no idea what to do! So, your
Partner asks you if you want to
form and exploration team with
him. He has a lot of confidence.
He's sure that team would pwn.
If you decline, he will beg you.
So just accept. As a matter of
fact you only accept because you
want to know why did you become
a pokemon. Your partner says you
gus have to go with Wigglytuff
to sign up as exploration team.
Training will be tough... But do
your best!!


"And so, Dinasty and Timatria
formed and Exploration Team.
This turned out to be their very
first step into many fantastic
realms of adventure that await
their arrival"


AND NOW ENJOY.............

POKEMON MYSTERY DUNGEON
EXPLORERS OF DARKNESS/TIME

Starring: YOU

:::Save Point:::


 ===============================
7.3 CHAPTER 2: THE NEW GUILD
  RECRUITS
 ===============================

You'll see Wigglytuff's guild as
soon as you can see again. You
must register there to have an
Exploration Team. You gotta
train until you become First
Rate Explorers. Your Partner
starts chickening out again, but
he decides to be brave ´cause
you're next to him now. He steps
on the Grate and his footprints
get scanned. He's still afraid,
but he's allowed to go in.

"Partner must step on the grave
too"

"..."

"That's you idiot!"

Uh... ok! Step on the grate, but
they won't be able to be sure
about which pokemon are you. But
who cares... come on in! There's
a hatch leading underground. You
go down. Woah! So many
Pokemons!! It's Wigglytuff's
guild! You'll see a Chatot
appear. He's Wigglytuff's right
hand. He thinks you guys are
salespersons. Your partner will
clarify that you want to become
an Exploration Team. He finds it
weird 'cause usually young
pokemons do not tend to make an
Exploration Team because the
training is tough... but I DON'T
KNOW WHY... he changed his
mind... and said training is a
piece of cake. Oh well, who
cares. You're about to meet the
GuildMaster! Be Nice! Always say
Please and Thanks!!

You'll meet Wigglytuff and asks
you the name you want for your
Exploration Team. I chose
HostleX ´cause... it sounds
kewl. W/e you choose, it's going
to be a good name for your
partner. REMEMBER that the word
TEAM is automatically put before
your name, so don't make the
silly mistake to choose
"FlameTeam" as your team's name
because it would be "Team
FlameTeam". Ohhh, Blue Rescue
Team Memories...

Back to Explorers of Darkness...
Once you say the name you want,
your team will now be OFFICIAL!
Yay! Now you will receive your
Pkmn Exploration Team Kit which
contains:

-Explorer Badge: Team ID
-Wonder Map: Just a Map, they
 added the word Wonder
-Treasure Bag: It's the Bag
 where you carry the items
   you get in dungeons. 16 Items
   max atm.

Inside your Treasure Bag you'll
find a rare item and a *Color*
Bow which are pretty kewl items.


CarlosPit Note: *Color* is
decided depending on your aura
color. Thanks Mipe for the
correction.

Now you're an official
apprentice, you gotta train your
ass off. After that, Chatot will
show you guys your room and your
... wait ...there's gotta be a
mistake... WHAT? Those are our
beds?!?!?!? What are we
chickens? (Sorry Torchic). Oh
well, as long as you're are
inside the guild.

While you're trying to sleep,
your partner will start
talking... a LOT. He says how
cool it is that you guys are
already in the guild bla bla
bla. But you start wondering why
did you become a Pkmn and what
the hell you're doing there.
You're too tired to think about
it.

::Save Point::

TIP: From now on, you can save
your game by climbing on your
 bed.


Next Morning, an annoying voice
will FORCE you to get up. It's
Loudred (Yesh, indeed. He's
loud) Loudred say you guys
better get up 'cause Wigglytuff
(From now on we'll call him WT),
may sound cool, but he can get
mad. And, oh man, we don't want
that right? So you better hurry!
After that you'll see like an
assembly. After that the
apprentices will start singing a
tacky song. Now it's time to
work!

As soon as you try to go
somewhere, Chatot will talk to
you. And you will follow
wherever he goes. He'll head to
the Bulletin Board. He'll talk
about the evil pokemons that are
appearing in the world
apparently 'cause the time got
whacked. That also caused a mass
outbreak of mystery dungeons.
Your partner will explain you
what the Mystery Dungeons are.
When he stops talking, Chatot
will look for an easy job for
you.

Your first job is rescuing a
pearl that belongs to Spoink.
Your partner will think that it
is way too lame, he wants to go
for treasures. But do you think
WT cares? No. You gotta go
'cause you're a rookie.

HostleX team:

Level (IN):

Timatria = 6

Level (OUT):

---------DRENCHED
         BLUFF----------------


When you reach the seventh
floor, you'll see the pearl and
get it. Somehow, you're back in
WT's guild again and have Chatot
in front of you. Spoink will be
very thankful and give you:

-Protein
-Calcium
-Iron
-3000 Coins

Wow! 3000 Coins! Unfortunately,
you won't get them! That's
right! ALL THE MONEY goes to
Wigglytuff. That big fat
bastard... Well, let's be fair.
You can keep 200 coins... yay...

Then you'll see Chimecho
announcing that the dinner's
ready and you'll see a lot of
munch munch munch...

Again, when your trying to
sleep, your partner will start
talking alone. He'll say how
cool it was when you got thanked
by Spoink and then he'll finally
fall asleep.




 ========================
7.4  CHAPTER 3: THE SCREAM
 ========================

Next Morning... Loudred Again

::Save Point::

Routine: Go out of the room!
Sing the Tacky Song! Work time!

Talk to Chatot and he will ask
you guys to follow him. You guys
will go to the bulletin board,
but this time he heads to the
Outlaw's Board. That means Bad
Pokemons who are wanted. Before
he assigns you a mission, Chatot
will call Bidoof so he can give
you guys a tour for you guys to
know everything.

Bidoof will explain you
everything about the Guild Room
and the Treasure Town, but
everything is even better
explained in your Instruction
Booklet. I will not cover this
part. C'mon just read your
Instruction Booklet... u lazy
ass.

Bidoof says he will be waiting
you guys by the Outlaw Board.
Before that, head to Kecleon's
Brothers Shop. Talk to him and
then close it. Don't buy. Marill
Team (Azurill+Marill) will
appear and buy an apple. Kecleon
will tell you guys that their
mother is sick. Immediately
after that, Azurill appears
again saying he found an extra
apple in his bag and he can't
afford it, but Kecleon is one
nice Pokemon so he let Azurill
keep it for free, but when
Azurill is leaving he fall down
and the extra apple too. You
pick it up, but when you return
it, you have a terrible
headache. And you hear Azurill
screaming...

 " H - h - h... HELP!!"

Unfortunately, you were the only
one who listened it and Azurill
was right in front of you, so
you probably were daydreaming.
Of course, you're prolly sleepy
since Loudred woke you up so
damn early right?

When Azurill leaves, follow him
and you'll see the Marill Team
talking with a Drowzee that
looks pretty cool and nice.
Marill Team will explain you
that they've lost an important
item for them and Drowzee's
going to help them find it.
Cool!

But when they are going to the
montains to look for the item,
Drowzee bumped with you and you
had another vision...


Drowzee: "Talking won't help
you... you're going to get hurt
now!"
     Azurill: "H... help!!"

You tell your partner what you
saw, but he convinces you that
you probably were daydreaming
again, since that Drowzee looked
like a really kewl pokemon.

What now? Oh yea... Bidoof...
Zomg poor bidoof! He's still
waiting! xD Hurry! To the Outlaw
Board!!

When you get to the Outlaw
Board, Bidoof will ask you what
kind of Outlaw you want. Your
partner, showing how brave he
is, asks for one that is not too
scary...

When Bidoof is about to choose
one... the Outlaw Board flips,
that means it's updating, so
you'll have to wait a little
bit. He'll explain that updating
the board is Dugtrio's job and
even though is not noticed, it's
really important. When the
update is over, your partner
starts shivering out of
nowhere... You know why? Do you?
No Idea? Could it be? YES!!
Drowzee! Outlaw!! Meanie!!
Without thinking, you guys will
run to save Azurill. When you're
heading to the mountains, you'll
meet with Marill., which is
afraid because he got lost while
they were exploring the
mountains. He started calling
Drowzee's and Azurill's names,
but he got no reply. He'll show
you where was the last time he
saw them, so, are you ready? I
hope you are 'casue it is rescue
time!!!


7.4.2 BOSS BATTLE: DROWZEE


---------------------MT. BRISTLE

Floors:

7 Floors

--------------------------------

Pokemons:

Lileep
Anorith
Shellos
Chingling

--------------------------------

Notes:

*Be level 7/8 when you go in
*Be careful with quick attack
*I was level 9 and my partner
 got pwned, so check your
 partner too!
*Foes HP: No more than 45

--------------------------------

BOSS BATTLE:

Drowzee

HP: No more than 100

Strategy:

If you have any seed that
inflicts paralysis or make the
foe sleep, USE IT! It would be
really helpful! When he's
asleep, use ONLY attacks that
inflict damage. Make sure your
partner too. If you follow this
strategy, Drowzee'll be gone
before you can say Carlos Knox!

--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level (IN):

Timatria = 8/9
Dinasty = 8/9

Level (OUT):

Timatria = 10
Dinasty = 10

--------------------MT. BRISTLE-


Drowzee will be very shocked
when he see you guys, but your
partner will start shivering so
he realized he's afraid. He has
no idea you guys kick his ass!
He has no idea you guys are
reading MY walkthrough! Ha!
Pwned!

When Drowzee's pwned, you'll
talk to Azurill to make sure he
is fine. He is. When you're
returning home, you'll meet
Magnezone Team (Magnezone + 2
Magnemite). Magnezone is like
the sheriff of that zone and the
magnemites are holding Drowzee
so he won't escape. They'll be
very thankful and they'll say
that the money will be sent to
your Guild. Sniff, Bye Bye
Money! When the Magnezone Team
is gone, Marill Team will say
thanks and give a big bug *Sniff
Sniff* Love happy endings!


  "Exploration Team Federation
  has sent a message...
 Timatria's Team was awarded
 with an enlarged Treasure Bag!"


You'll appear in the guild
(How?) and Chatot will inform
you guys that he received the
money, 3000 Coins, but WT's part
is 2700...

So... 3000-27000= 300... Yay?

But... how come you were able to
predict what was going to
happen? Are you an Alakazam?
Weird...

It's dark outside and you wanna
sleep, but your talkative
partner will start talking about
the storm. Then he will ask you
if you remember something before
you were a Pokemon, but you
don't. He thinks there's some
kind of relation between your
dream and you (Duh)

Then he'll start talking about
Time Gears. These are hidden in
forests, underground caverns and
even Volcanoes! They have an
important function, which is
protect time and keep time
flowing properly in it's region.
If one of this is taken away,
time would probably stop running
in that zone.

You'll see a new image, a
Pokemon, you know which one is
it? Yup, Grovile (I don't know
if it's always Grovile) and
looks like he is going to steal
a Time Gear! Was he able to
steal it? We don't know...

::Save Point::

Wake Up, Routine, Hooray! Chatot
will assign you a job. Go
downstairs and check the
Job/Outlaw Bulletin. Choose any
job, I'm pretty sure the ones I
get are not the same ones you
get, but still, I'll post the
ones I did and if I had any
difficulties.

*Reccomendation: Stay with Level
 C missions atm*

*When I post 3 Missions, that
 means that in no more than 3
 days
you'll be able to go on with the

7.5  CHAPTER 4: GATEKEEPERS
 =======================


After sleeping and doing the
rutine, Loudred will call you
two guys, then Digglet ask you
guys if you can do his Sentry
Duty because he gotta help
Dugtrio in his updating job. You
obviously accept. The game is
fairly easy, you get to see the
footprint of a Pokemon in the
upper screen of your DS. In the
other screen you'll have 4
options and you gotta decide
from which Pokemon those
footprints belong. Consider it a
Mini-Game 'cause if you don't do
it ok, it's not important during
the storyline. Still, try to do
it ok because you can get nice
items if you have more than 5k
of score.

 ===============================
7.6 CHAPTER 5: THE FIRST
  OFFICIAL EXPLORATION
 ===============================

After you get up, Chatot will
make an announcement for all the
guild. He'll say that in a place
named Treeshroud Forest, a Time
Gear has been stolen. Chatot
says that Magnezone has started
the investigations because if
one was stolen, than means many
Time Gears can be stolen.
Everyone seems worried about it.
When all of them go to work,
Chatot will assign you two guys
your first official exploration.
Apparently there's a waterfall
nearby and he wants you to
explore it. Yay! No time to
lose! Well, we can make an
exception for Chimecho. He'll
call you when you go downstairs.
He'll explain you that he has
started an assembly, which means
you can now recruit other
Pokemon! So, your Exploration
Team will be bigger and bigger!
How does this works? When you
defeat Pokemons, some of them
will respect you and, therefore,
will want to join your
Exploration Team. You can either
accept them or refuse to their
request. He'll explain you the
basics, even though I already
did.

Also, if you go to Treasure
Town, you'll see that Marowak's
Dojo is now open! Let's go take
a look! Awww, Marowak has no
clients at all... But YAY! Since
you guys were his first clients,
he will let you guys get in for
free. Marowak will explain you
that when you enter to his
Practice Dungeons, you'll lose
all the items that were in your
inventory, so you should
probably store them before you
train. Coins are safe tho.

Anyway... Let's head to
Waterfall! Prepare your
inventory. When you go there
you'll see a big waterfall in
front of you. It's soo strong
you can't even stand close to
it. Your partner tells you to
try it but the waterfall is a
strong one so you get pushed by
it. After that, you have a
vision. According to your
vision, if you jump towards the
waterfall, you can trespass it
and get to a hidden cave. Your
partner trusts you, and there
you go! Zomg!!! It was true! You
get to a totally new Dungeon!
Welcome to Waterfall Cave!

 at all (Except Tangela).

-----------------WATERFALL CAVE-


When you get to the Gem Zone
(Name invented by me!), you'll
see a giant gem stucked in the
wall. Your partner thinks that
if you guys take it, it would be
awesome. He tries to get it but
he can't because it's REALLY
stucked. Your partner says you
should give it a shot. You'll
try to, but you have no success.
After trying, you have ANOTHER
vision. A Pokemon trying to get
the gem but when the gem started
moving, a giant wave came. As
soon as you finish having your
vision you'll see your partner
saying "Hey! It's moving" ...
Damn it. A Huge wave is coming!
You try to escape, but your legs
are way too short, so the wave
got you guys, but hey... at
least now you know how it feels
to fly. You'll land in a place
called Hot Springs. These hot
waters are good for you to
recover yout tired muscles and
creaky joins. Torkoal will show
you were is Hot Springs located
in the Wonder Map. You guys
decide to stay there so you can
recover.

::Save Point::

Back in the guild, you will
explain what happened in the
Waterfalls. Chatot considers it
a MAJOR, HUGE discovery! You
should be happy, but you're not,
because you're still thinking in
the vision you had. The shape of
that Pokemon looked familiar...
Yes... No doubt about it..
WIGGLYTUFF! You tell your
partner that you had a vision
where WT intended to take the
gem. Your partner tells the same
to Chatot and he thinks that has
no sense at all Still, he
decided to ask WT about it, even
though he has no idea why would
some rookies accept they were
not the ones who discovered the
dungeon. Oh well, immediately
Chatot will say that, indeed, WT
had already been there.
Actually, WT said something
like: "Yes, I think so...
YOOOMTAH!!!!". We guess he tried
to say yes.

Time to sleep... or not? You're
trying to sleep but your
comprehensive partner will start
talking. He says that his dream
is to solve the mistery of his
Relic Fragment. He also realizes
that every time you had a
vision, is because you touched
it. But hey, it's true! Drowzee,
the Waterfall, the Gem. Here's
something tricky. You saw the
future in Drowzee's case, but
you saw the past in the
Waterfall/Gem one. Weird huh?
When you finally are about to
sleep, Chatot will show up
saying Wigglytuff wants to talk
with you and your partner.
Wigglytuff will tell you and
your partner that he plans to
make an expedition soon.
Usually, rookies are not even
considered in this expeditions,
but you guys have done an
awesome job, so they decide to
take you guys in consideration.
But, beware! You're still not in
the expedition. You guys are
candidates... so work your asses
off the next few weeks.


 =======================
7.7  CHAPTER 6: TEAM SKULL
 =======================

Next Morning. Loudred.

::Save Point::

Chatot will inform all the guild
that there's going to be the
Lake Expedition. Everyone seems
happy. Haha! Suckers! You guys
already know :) Well, it's work
time. So, let's check the
Bulletin Board.

Whn you go to the Job Board
area, you'll see Koffing and
Zubat. They are an exploration
team... Team Skull! They wonder
what the hell are you guys doing
there, so you tell him you are a
Exploration Team too. They want
to talk alone with your partner.
They keep telling your partner
that he's a coward, but he tells
them that they are here to
train. Koffing and Zubat call
their chief, Skuntank. That's
right! Zubat + Koffing +
Skuntank = Skull Team. Skuntank
uses a weird attack (Let's call
it the Stunky Attack), after
making all the place suck, they
leave. W/e they suck! Haha! Got
it? They used an attack that
sucked, so they suck! Haha! I'm
funny?

Anyway, let's continue. Job
Time.

let my Little Cousin do it) So

Again, you'll go sleep. Next

up.

::Save Point::

Chatot will announce that there
are new allies in the guild.
Guess who are they? Yesh... Team
Skull. Theyll live with you guys
for a few days until the
expedition. After introducing
theirselves, they will leave,
but all the room starts smelling
bad. It's a new day of work! But
you guys give a lame hooray.
Wigglytuff seems sad... oh no...

Outlaw Hunt 7:

Client: Geodude
Objective: Pwn Lileep
Lileep's HP: Less than 160

Floor: 6
Reward: Special Band
Explorer Points: 20


After doing a mission, you'll
see a little conversation. It's
Team Skull, they are trying to
eat ALL the food! Noes!

Next Morning... Loudred...

::Save Point::

Hooray! Ok guys, your mission
today is: Gather some Perfect
Apples. Why is that? Because for
a "Weird" reason, all the
Perfect Apples that were in the
Kitchen dissapeared. So you guys
must go to Apple Woods.


------------------APPLE WOODS---

 Hoppip

*Use fire attacks. They pwn
 anything in this dungeon.

*Flying Attacks (Peck, Wing
 Attack) are also cool.

*Team Skull followed you.

*You can find Perfect Apples in
 Deep Apple Woods

Level (OUT):

-----------------APPLE WOODS----


When you get to Deep Apple
Woods, you'll see a big tree
with apples. You can't get them.
Team Skull will arrive, don't
worry, there won't be a Boss
Battle. Skuntank will use a
tackle against the tree so the
Perfect Apples will drop. They
will get them. Koffing and
Skuntank will use a Double
Skunty Attack. Gosh! You kinda
faint. When you get up, Team
Skull will be gone and so will
the Perfect Apples. You have
nothing else to do there. Just
return home.

When you inform Chatot that you
couldn't get the Perfect Apples,
he will get crazy and won't
listen to your partner's
explications. You 2 guys are
going bed without dinner! But
that's not all, you'll go with
Chatot to inform Wigglytuff that
there are no more Perfect Apples
for him. Gulp.

Some seconds later, you'll be in
Wigglytuff's office, of course,
he's smiling!

CarlosPit Note: I gotta admit, I
didn't like Wigglytuff when I
started the game, but he's
probably my favorite character
now! He's kewl!


Ok... back to your Epic Story,
Chatot will inform Wigglytuff
that you guys didn't get any
Perfect Apples. Wigglytuff won't
be mad at all, since he thinks
there are some more Perfect
Apples in the kitchen... Uhh,
when Chatot tells him that, as a
matter of fact, there are no
more Perfect Apples at all... Oh
no... Oh no... COVER YOUR
EARS!!! Fast!! Zomg... Guess
who's comming to the rescue?
That's right. Team Skull! Ugh...
They will give a Perfect Apple
to Wigglytuff, and you can't
imagine how happy he looks. He's
soo happy, but you guys are mad!
Wigglytuff now consider Team
Skull as childhood friends. You
guys are sent to your room. You
wonder why did Team Skull help
you by giving Wigglytuff a
Perfect Apple? Well, they don't
care a tiny rat's ass about
you... they want to earn
Wigglytuff's trust so they can
go to the expedition and then
kick your ass.

Next Morning... Loudred again.

::Save Point::

Chatot will announce that the
expedition members will soon be
known. So everyone will work a
lot. It's working time! When
everyone leaves, Chatot will
want to talk with you and your
partner. He explains you two
that's going to be nearly
impossible for you guys to be in
the expedition. The reason? You
failed a very important mission
yesterday, so just don't get
your hopes up.

When Chatot tells you to go to
work, you'll hear Bidoof calling
you. he'll tell you to go to you
"room". When you are there,
you'll see Bidoof, Sunflora and
Chimecho. What's going on? They
have 2 apples for you! Yay!!
Finally some food, you guys were
starving!

After eating those delicious
apples, go outside and Croagunk
will call you saying that his
shop is now open. For more Info
check your Instruction booklet.

So... it's working time!

announcement... The expedition
members will be announced
tomorrow. The moment has finally
come, how do they expect you
guys to sleep with all the
anxiety?

You're such a good pal that
you'd rather your partner to be
chosen instead of
 you, since you know he has
 given his 110%. You'll see
 another image,
Grovyle stealing another Time
Gear.

Next Morning, Loudred...

it. It's time to get ready! Buy
Reviver Seeds, Max Elixirs,
Sleep Seeds, Big Apples, etc.
You can't bring recruited
members, so don't waste your
time trying to bring someone.
Store your coins with Duskull so
you don't lose them.


   "The Exploration Team
   Federation has sent a Message

 Timatria's team was rewarded
 with a bigger treasure bag"


Once you're all set, talk to
Chatot.

Objective: Exploration of
Fogbound Lake

Since you're such a big group,
Chatot decides to separate you
guys by groups.

Group 1: Wigglytuff and Chatot
Group 2: Sunflora, Digglet,
Loudred and Croagunk Group 3:
Dugtrio, Chimecho and Corpish
Group 4: Team Skull Group 5:
Your Partner, Bidoof and You.

Anyone unhappy with the groups?
Yesh, Wigglytuff! LOL! He says
it's kinda boring being with
Chatot.

CarlosPit note: Wouldn't it be
awesome having WT in your group?
I'd love to know in which level
WT is.

Hooray!

::Save Point::

You'll be in the beggining of a
cave. You'll see a Kanghaskan
Statue, if you want to, you can
use it to Save your Game or you
can use it as storage.

When you enter to the cave, your
partner will say that you have
two choices.

Option 1: Craggy Coast Option 2:
Missing Data (Didn't take note)

Thing is like this, each time
you have to choose between 2
options, you can either train or
keep going with the storyline.
The first one is used to
continue with the storyline and
the second one is the one used
to train and gather some items
you missed.

Since your plan is not to go
directly to the cave, but to
meet in the base camp, your
partner will decide to rest
there.

Next Morning

Kanghaskan Statue, Save Point.


Again you'll have 2 options...

Option 1: Mt. Horn
Option 2: Rock Path

Just like I said before, go to
Rock Path if you feel like
training and go to Mt. Horn if
you want to continue with the
storyline.

 ==============================
7.8  CHAPTER 8: GROUDON'S HEART
 ==============================

You'll reach to the Base Camp.
You think you were fast? No! You
guys are the last ones! Boo! You
find that place extremely
familiar, but there's no time to
lose... You must continue with
the expedition. When everyone
gathers, Chimecho will tell a
legend he heard about Fogbound
Lake. It is said that Fogbound
Lake is the home of Uxie, one
member of the Legendary Trio.
Chimecho explained that Uxie
tries to keep this place as a
secret by cleaning their
visitors memories. Uhh... wait a
second...

You? Familiar with the place?
Erase Memories? Maybe... who
knows...


Fogbound Lake Missions:

* Find a way to elminate the fog
  that is everywhere.
* Find Fogbound Lake

When everyone leaves, you have
two options.

- Foggy Forest (Continue with
  the storyline)
- Forest Path (Level and gather
  some items)

Whatever you choose, your find
is going to find a weird shiny
orb. It's red. What is it? Hmmm,
who cares, maybe it's good
money!


CarlosPit Note: Forest Path has

Linoone, Houndour, Dunsparce,
etc.

-----------------FOGGY FOREST---


When you reach the pond, you'll
meet Corpish. Even though none
of you have found a way to
eliminate the fog, Corpish has
found a statue of Groudon, the
Continent Pokemon. It has an
scription. It says that igning
life to the statue will show the
path to the treasure. Since you
guys have no clue what does that
means, your partner will ask you
to touch the statue, for you to
have a vision. It's worth a
shot, isn't it?

"It's here! It's here!"

"Place the Drought Stone in
groudon's heart"

"That lifts the fog"

"Very well done! Good Job
Partner!"

This time you didn't see
anything, you only heard voices.
But, Drought Stone? Could it be
possible? Maybe... the red stone
your partner found earlier? When
your partner inserts the Red
Stone in the little hole the
Groudon Statue had in his heart,
the fog will dissapear and
you're now able to see clearly.
Corpish is planning to tell
everyone you guys solved the
puzzle, so he leaves. Suddenly,
the bad guys of the movie will
show up. Yep, Team Skull. They
are planning to pwn you guys but
suddenly my favorite character
arrives! That's right!
Wigglytuff chasing his perfect
apple! Obviously, Team Skull
won't attack you guys.
Wigglytuff will tell you two to
go find out more about Fogbound
lake. You'll leave and you'll
see Team Skull preparing an
attack to hurt Wiglytuff! Noess!



 ===============================
7.9 CHAPTER 9: THE MISTERY OF
  FOGBOUND LAKE
 ===============================

Save the Game. After entering to
the cave, you'll see a little

Once you get to the peak, you'll

GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!

Then you'll see a little movie
of your guild and Wigglytuff
looking the Groudon Statue. Uh
wait, Wigglytuff? Yay! He's
fine! You'll also see Team
Skull, they got pwned by
Wigglytuff.

Once the movie is over, you'll
see yourself again. Oh yea,
you'll also see Groudon, the
Continent Pokemon. Guess what?
He will challenge you to a
battle! Yay! Boss Battle!!


7.9.2 Boss Battle: Groudon?



--------------------GROUDON-----

HP: Missing Data


CarlosPit Note: The (?) after
groudon is not a typo.

Strategy:

I noticed something weird about
this Groudon. He didn't use a
single fire attack during my
battle. I also noticed something
weird about the turns.

Instead of: YOU-PARTNER-GROUDON

it's more like...

YOU-PARTNER-YOU-PARTNER-GROUDON

You'll receive some dmg after
you attack Groudon. As I already
said, you and your partner will
be able to attack twice before
he makes a move, so that's one
BIG Adventage.

---------------------GROUDON----


Once you're done with Groudon,
you'll probably be thinking
"Zomg I effin pwn, no one can
beat me!! bring mewtwo!" ...
Well, let's see if you knew what
I'm about to say...

GROUDON = ILLUSION

That's right! You defeated
nothing but a Groudon Illusion!

Your partner will hear a voice,
accusing you guys to go Fogbound
Lake just for messing the place.
Your partner will swear saying
you guys are not intruders, you
just want to know some answers.
He realizes you're being honest
so he shows up.

It's Uxie, one member of the
Legendary Trio. He will show you
guys the Fogbound Lake, it's
really beautiful. In the middle
of it, you can see a Time Gear.
You'll feel a weird sensation...
Uxie is the guardian of the
lake. A few seconds later,
Wigglytuff will arrive
introducinghimself to Uxie. He
seems pretty excited. Then, the
whole guild will arrive.
Wigglytuff asks Uxie to protect
the Time Gear. Wigglytuff will
also promise not to tell anyone
about the lake. Guild Members?
Time to get back to the guild...



"And so... the guild's long and
challenging expedition finally
came
 to an end. Wigglytuff and the
 members safely returned to the
 guild. For Timatria and the
 Apprentices, going to the guild
 meant taking up the standard
 training schedule. It was life
 as usual back to the guild!"



 ======================
7.10  CHAPTER 10: DUSKNOIR
 ======================
Next Morning.... DAMN IT!
Loudred is back! Yawn...
Routine... Hooray! CHatot will
be very happy 'cause everyone
has a lot of energy. Suddenly,
you'll hear Loudred screaming
(Weird huh?). He's complaining
'cause Digglet can't identify a
Pokemon's footprints. The
Pokemon says he wants to talk
with Wigglytuff and his name
is... Dusknoir. You may wonder
"Who the hell is Dusknoir?"
Well, he's one of the best
Explorers. He's so good he
doesn't even needs a Exploration
Team, he's solo. He's very wise.
He has a lot of Pokemon
Knowledge. Wigglytuff seems
really friendly, but hey... he's
always like that. WT introduces
Dusknoir to all the guild.
Dusknoir asks about the last
expedition you guys had, but
Wigglytuff says it was pretty
useless because you found
nothing. Yeah, he's keeping the
promise. Dusknoir seems like a
pretty kewl guy. Very humble.
He's heading to Treasure Town...


Ok, back to work. Your mission?

they can't defeat Wigglytuff, so
they're planning to hunt your
asses down.

Next Morning... Loudrd...
Routine...Hooray... Chatot will
ask you guys to go check if
Kecleon is planning to sell
Perfect Apples. When you reach
Kecleon's Market, you'll see
Dusknoir chatting with the
Kecelon's brothers. Kecleon will
ask your partner what does he
wants, he'll reply that they are
not planning to put Perfect
Apples in stock. Awwts. Marril
Brothers will appear, guess
what? They're still looking for
their Water Float. Team Skull
was listening to everything and
they say something about
informing Skuntank. They'll
leave and you have to return to
the guild too! When you inform

Plus, you'll get a weird item
like Zinc or Iron, yay!



During Dinner Time, Chatot will
inform that ANOTHER TIME GEAR
HAS BEEN STOLEN! It's the second
Time Gear that has been stolen,
so you guys better not tell
anyone about the Time Gear Uxie
is protecting. During the night
your partner will start
wondering why would someone want
to steal them. He also wonders
how's Uxie doing. Immediately
after that, you'll see a movie.
Groudon being defeated and Uxie
saying he shouldn't have trusted
us. Then you'll hear Grovyle
saying no one told him about
this Time Gear. He will take it.


::Save Point::


Morning! It's Working Time. When
you guys are about to go work,
Loudred will inform you that you
have visitors. It's the Marill
Bros. They found a scrap of
paper at the beach.

"The water float is now under
our posession. Just try to take
it from us! We'll
 wait in the deepest part of Amp
 Plains."

Amp Plains is a place where you
can find lots of Electric

sees the water float he'll be
relieved. But... you thought it
was going to be that easy?
Nooo!!

Luxray and Luxios x7 !!!

CarlosPit Note: Awwts! My
favorite Pkmn! Oh well...


7.10.2 Boss Battle: Luxray


--------------------LUXRAY------

HP: 210

Strategy:

Sleep Luxray by either using a

get rid of the Luxios. They have
less than 80 HP. After pwning

When you defeat them, Luxray
will start charging a Super
Attack, but when he's about to
attack, Durknoir appears. He
apologizes for your actions and
explain that your intention
wasn't to control their
territory. Apparently, Luxray
likes that place 'cause by that
time of the year, there are
Thunderstorms.

You found the Water Float! But,
who hid the Water Float there?
Skull Team... They'll run
because we have Dusknoir and he
would pwn.

Oh well, it's time to deliver
that item.

::Save Point::

After giving the item, Marill
Team will be very thankful.
You'll start talking of one of
your visions. You'll explain it
to Dusknoir, in case he knows
something about it. Dusknoir
will explain you that the
ability you have is called
Dimensional Scream. You ask
Dusknoir if he knows something
else.

Somehow, you will appear in the
beach. You will tell Dusknoir
your story. You know, Beach,
Human, Pokemon, Sk... wait,
Human? Dusknoir seems pretty
shocked after hearing that.
Dusknoir will ask you for your
name, and when you say it, he'll
have a weird expression in his
face, but he denies knowing
something about you. Dusknoir
will explain you what does
Dimensional Scream is. After it,
you'll see lots of Pelipper
flying and Bidoof will appear.
Apparently there's an important
announcement... so you guys
better go.



================================
7.11 CHAPTER 11: GROVYLE THE
  THIEF
================================


Woah! Another Time Gear has been
stolen! And guess which one...
the one Uxie was protecting!!
Noeess!! Dusknoir seems
impressed 'cause WigglyTuff had
told him that your guild found
nothing in their expedition. WT
explains Dusknoir that it was a
promise you had made to Uxie.
Apparently, Uxie was knocked,
but he's ok now. Wigglytuff will
start crying. Wigglytuff decides
to to make an expedition to
catch Grovyle. Let's get ready!!

Get some Reviver Seeds, Max
Elixirs, Huge Apples, Oran
Berries and some Violent Seeds.

When you're ready, go to see
Chatot.

Chatot will divide the guild by
teams. Next Stop: Northern
Desert.

When you reach the end of the
Northern Desert, you'll see some
quick sands. You'll also feel
the same sensation you felt when
you saw Fogbound Lake, but you
decide to return since you had
no choice. Back in the guild, no
one found anything. Well, that's
not truth, Bidoof took a little
souvenir from the Crystal Cave.

::Save Point::

While Chatot and Dusknoir are
thinking in a strategy, they
give you guys the freedom to go
wherever you want to. Because of
the sensation you felt, you want
to return to the Quick Sands.
When you return, it will be the
same, you get to a point where
you can't go farder. Those
Quicksands... they MUST be the
key! You tell your partner your
idea, and he trusts you. Ready
to jump? There we go!

When you get to the Underground
Lake, you'll find Mespirit. He's
another member of the Legendary
Trio. Yup, it's Boss Time!


7.11.2 Boss Battle: Mespirit


--------------------MESPIRIT----

HP: 350-

Strategy:

Sleep Him and he's be a

--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

---------------------MESPIRIT---



Once you defeat Mespirit, he'll
try to stop you guys, because he
thinks you're planning to steal
the time gear. Apparently, Uxie
used Telekinesis to talk with
Mespirit and inform him/her that
the Time Gear from Fogbound Lake
was stolen by a thief. Grovyle
will appear and immediately
attacks you. You're weak at the
moment so he'll pwn you and then
pwn Mespirit. You'll try to stop
him, but he will pwn you again.
Now there's nothing to stop him,
so he'll take the Time Gear.
Mespirit will say he/she is
sorry for doubting about you
guys. But there's no time to
talk! Run because the time is
freezing here!



===============================
7.12 CHAPTER 12: THE ONLY OPTION
===============================


Magnezone will be in the guild,
informing that Mespirit is ok.
The guild will try to cheer you
up by saying you guys did an
awesome job and they agree that
it would be easier if they had a
clue. Dusknoir will say that you
have a clue...


CarlosPit Note: Pokemon Fans,
little question. Who can tell me
the 3 members of the Legendary
Trio? Uxie, Mespirit and? Yes,
Azelf! Good Job!


So Azelf must be the guardian of
another Time Gear. What else?
Uxie and Mespirit were located
in lakes... Both of them were in
place where there's not supposed
to be water. So check again
everywhere! But before that,
Dusknoir will ask Bidoof to
bring the little souvenir he got
from Crystal Cave. Reason? He
wants you to try the Dimensional
Scream. Bidoof accepts and gets
the little crystal. When you
touch it, you'll see Grovyle and
Azelf, and Grovyle is about to
take the Time Gear. But is it
past or future? Who cares?!?!?
It's the only option you have to
capture Grovyle! Let's go for it
and pray it was future! Oh yea,
by the way, Wigglytuff is
sleeping ^^ Time to go Crystal
Cave!

After these 13 floors, you will
get to the Crystal Lake. Your
partner will notice there are 2
pokemon in an island nearby. Go
check! It's Azelf and Grovyle!
So it was future huh... Grovyle
is about to take the Time Gear,
but Azelf had something planned
and ice spikes appear and they
make impossible to reach the
Time Gear. Grovyle plans to
attack Azelf when you arrive.
Grovyle isn't happy... Boss Time


7.12.2 Boss Battle: Grovyle




--------------------GROVYLE-----

HP: Less than 630

Strategy:

If you have a fire based move...
Oh my Dear Riolu... use it! He's
the toughest Pkmn you've found.
According to my math, he should
be lvl 35 more less.


--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

---------------------GROVYLE----

Even if you win, in the
storyline it will appear as if
he pwned you. You two are badly
hurt and Grovyle is going to
kill your partner when Dusknoir
appears. Looks like Dusknoir
knows Grovyle. When they're
about to battle, Grovyle
vanishes. Dusknoir vanishes too.
Guild will arrive and they take
you back to the guild 'cause you
are badly hurt. You will wake
up, Chimecho will realize that
and he'll call everyone.
Everyone seems happy. You will
explain all of them that you
think Dusknoir knows Grovyle. It
is shocking for everyone.
Magnamite will announce that
Magnezone is with Dusknoir in
Treasure Town, so time to go and
it's also the end of this
chapter ;D



================================
7.13 CHAPTER 13: DUSKNOIR'S
  SECRET
================================

When you get to Treasure Town,
you'll see how the Legendary
Trio meets again. Such an
amazing moment *sigh*. Dusknoir
has an announcement to make.
Apparently, he and Grovyle are
Pokemon from the future. He
feels sorry for lying for such a
long time. He also explains
Grovyle's plan. His plan is to
paralyze the world, which also
would be the end of it, by
stealing the Time Gears.
Fortunately, Dusknoir and the
Legendary Trio have come up with
a plan.

1 Million Dollar Plan: Spread a
rumor where it is said that the
Legendary Trio is going to seal
a Time Gear so no one can steal
it. That way, Grovyle will go to
steal it asap and BANG! Dusknoir
catches him. Of course Uxie,
Mespirit and Azelf's lives would
be in danger, but they agree
with that.

So, your job is... spreading the
rumor. FINALLY AN EASY JOB!

Still, we shouldn't make Grovyle
suspicious so it's time to work.

There are no news about Dusknoir
and the Legendary Trio... so
keep working!

Again, your shy and quiet
partner will start talking.
Again, nothing important. He's
just wondering how Dusknoir and
the Trio is doing.

::Save Point::

Next morning, Chatot will say
that there are still no news
about them. A weird sound will
start. Looks like Grovyle was
caught by Dusknoir! Hooray! He's
going to send Grovyle to the
future, but he's returning too.
Everyone to Treasure Town! Once
there, you'll notice a dark hole
in the middle of the town. It's
a Dimensional Hole. Dusknoir
arrives with Grovyle. Dusknoir
trusts in the Legendary Trio
with the Time Gears. He says
good bye to everyone, but he
calss you and your partner...

It's the sad end... or is it?

BANG! He grabs you guys and
touches the Dimensional Hole.
You're gone.


::Save Point::


 ==============================
7.3  CHAPTER 14: INTO THE FUTURE
 ==============================


You'll wake up in a jail with
your partner. Why are you there?
What happened? Oh right... the
Dimensional Hole... ZOMG! We're
in the future!!

CarlosPit Note: Holy sheezcakes!

Go to the gate to realize that
yes, you're locked...

A few seconds after that, about
6 Sableye will appear and and
blindfold you and your partner.
When you regain the awesome gift
of the sight, you'll notice that
you, your partner and GROVYLE
are tied to 3 poles. You'll talk
to Grovyle, he'll inform you
guys that those Sableyes are
ready to pwn your tiny asses.
Dusknoir and the Sableye appear.
Indeed... he wants to eliminate
you... How nice.

Grovyle will ask you what can
you do... the answer is...
attack.

So this is the new plan:

2 Million Dollar Plan: When the
Sableyes are about to pwn us
with their Fury Swipes, you'll
attack them.

CarlosPit Note: WHAT IF THEY
DON'T USE FURY SWIPES AT
ALL?!?!?

But... Grovyle was right... As
soon as they start using Fury
Swipes, you regain movement and
attack them. When you're free,
Grovyle uses a Luminous orb and
then Poof... you're gone.
Dusknoir and the Sableyes will
leave the room and you'll appear
again. Grovyle used Dig to hide
you guys. No time to talk!
Escape! Run! Run! Run!

Finally, you'll leave the
building and... WOAH... What the
F... is this? Is that the
future? There's no movement at
all... no air... no morning.
Sableyes are comming so you
better keep running... You'll
reach a cave. Grovyle will offer
you guys to team up, but your
partner declines because he
thinks Grovyle is the bad guy...
There's one question though...

Why is the world paralyzed?
Didn't you guys stop it?

Woah... those damn Sableyes...
Time to keep running. Grovyle
will enter the cave, and you
should do that too...

Save/Take/Store by using the
Kanghaskan Statue. Move on...

TO YOU!


7.14.2 Boss Battle: Spiritomb


--------------------SPIRITOMB---

HP: 450

Strategy:

Spiritomb can be rather
annoying, since he has no
weakness. Just use your
strongest attack and try to
inflict him as much dmg as
possible.

After defeating him, the aura
will be gone. Grovyle will
explain that good Pokemon have
become bad ones because the
hostile enviroment. He'll ask
your partner if he trusts him
now, but your partner wil doubt.
According to Grovyle, they can't
be together if there is no
trust. He's right... so your
partner decides to trust him.
Follow Grovyle

::Save Point::


 ===============================
7.15 CHAPTER 15: THE SECRET OF
  PLANET'S PARALYSIS
 ===============================


Grovyle will start explaining
that the reason of the planet's
paralysis is the collapse of
Temporal Tower, which is where
Dialga, the Deity of Time lives.
After the collapse of the
Temporal Tower, Dialga lost
almost all his reason, and now,
governed by darkness, he's
turned into Primal Dialga, a
Pokemon that only seeks self
preservation and has no emotion.

Primal Dialga doesn't likes
Grovyle 'cause he's trying to
stop it by collecting the Time
Gears. Looks like the only way
to stop the tower collapse is to
place the Time Gears there.
Dusknoir is Primal Dialga's spy,
but your partner doesn't
believes that. Grovyle hasn't
given up yet, so he wants to
return to the past to collect
the Time Gears. He must find
Celebi to return to the past.
Follow him. Destination? Dusk
Forest! That's the place where
Celebi, the Legendary Pokemon
lives.

Celebi was the one who enabled
Grovyle to return to the past.
Because of that, Celebi is now
in trouble too, because she's
affecting history. Oh well,
let's hurry! There's a
Kanghaskan statue is you need
it. Your partner will STILL
don't trust Grovyle, but you
guys should focus on returning.
You start feeling the same
sensation that you had when you
were going to meet Uxie.
Anyway... let's go... ZOMG A
SABLEYE!

When you get to Deep Dusk

is not there. You'll hear a
voice and Celebi will appear.
Your partner will make fun of
Celebi 'cause her appearance.
Celebi gets angry, so your
partner apologizes. Celebi
accepts his aplogizes. You must
find the passage of time. You
two wonder what the f... is
that. Grovyle and Celebi will
explain that. There's a
Kanghskan statue, so use it if
needed.

After those 12 floors, you'll
reach an open place where you
can see the Passage of Time.
Celebi is the one who is
supposed to open it, but when
she's moving, you hear a voice.
It's Dusknoir... he was
following you guys. Actually,
it's Dusknoir and the Sableye
Squad. Grovyle tells you to get
ready 'cause you'll fight, but
Dusknoir introduces a new member
to his team... Primal Dialga.
Damn! Grovyle gives up, 'cause
there's no way you can defeat
him. One thing is to battle
Dusknoir, but a totally
different thing is to battle
Primal Dialga. Fortunately...
there's still a chance. When
Grovyle traveled back in time,
he traveled with someone else...
a human... named... *your name*!

CarlosPit Note: Holy Cow!

Dusknoir tells Grovyle that
you're that human he was talking
about. Grovyle seems confused,
since his partner was a human
not a Pkmn. AGAIN, Dusknoir
explains that you used to be a
human. Dusknoir sends the
Sableye Squad to attack you, but
Celebi uses his time travel
skill and warps you to to the
Passage of Time. TIME to go back
to our TIME.


 =========================
7.16 CHAPTER 16: A NEW DAWN
 =========================

You wake up at the beach. You
guys made it! Back in your time!
You probably want Grovyle to
explainev everything, but where
should you talk? Wigglytuff's
Guild? Nay, remember that
Grovyle, in this time, is a
Wanted Outlaw. Thanks God your
partner has a secret spot, which
is by Sharpedo Bluff. It's your
partner's house! He used to live
there before you joined the
guild. Anyway, Grovyle will
start explaining everything,
apparently, you and Grovyle were
exploring the planet's
paralysis, so you were looking
for the location of the Time
Gears in the past by using your
Dimensional Scream.

Note: The Dimensional Scream can
only be used when your close to
a trusted Pokemon Partner.

Grovyle will be happy that
you're ok, 'cause even though
you're different, he know's your
still his human partner. You're
his best friend. Oh well, it's
late, so you guys better go to
sleep! Tomorrow you have to go
explore!

3 Million Dollars Plan: Collect
the Time Gears. The time will
stop in the region where the TG
is removed, but the time will be
restored if the Temporal Tower
doesn't collapse.

::Save Point::

Grovyle will wake up, but he
won't see your partner. Grovyle
will go outside and see your
partner looking the sea. Your
partner was thinking about lots
of things. They will start
talking untill the sun rises.
It's time to collect those Time
Gears. You should probably go to
Treeshroud Forest first because
there's no guardian there.

Once you're in Deep Treeshroud
Forest, you'll notice that the
time is not moving. Why not?!?!?
The Time Gear is there!
Apparently the time is not
running because the Temporal
Tower is already collapsing. So
you must collect the Time Gears
asap! Temporal Tower is located
in Hidden Land, which is hidden
FYI. So your mission will be to
gather some information about
Hidden Land while Grovyle
collects the Time Gears.

Time to start looking for it!
Where? No idea...


 =========================
7.17 CHAPTER 16: A NEW DAWN
 =========================

Uhh... Back at Wigglytuff's.
Scared? Nay. Digglet scans the
footprints of your partner and
he shocks. Zomg you guys are
back! Everyone goes outside to
say hi. Wigglytuff too. After
telling your story to Chatot, he
will not believe it. Sigh.
Everyone is still thinking
Dusknoir is the good guy because
he was nice to them. Finally,
Sunflora remembers when Dusknoir
grabbed you and took you guys to
the future. Everyone starts
wondering why would he do that.
After thinking a little about
it, everyone believes you, even
WT! Still, Chatot won't. But it
won't take long, since Chatot
always agrees with Wigglytuff.
Chatot will give a lame excuse
and start believing you. How to
find out how to reach Hidden
Land? If someone knows... it's
Torkoal! Let's go!

::Save Point::

Going to Waterfall Cave. 9F =
Hot Springs.

Unfortunately, once you meet the
old Torkoal, he won't help much
since he doesn't remembers much.
Only thing he knows is that you
must show some proof. Oh well,
too bad... Let's go back to the
guild.

::Save Point::

Morning... Loudred...

Just because you didn't find it
on your first day it doesn't
means you should give up! Keep
looking!

A few seconds later, Digglet
will detect Torkoal's
footprints. Yesh! He remembered
some new things! That "proof"
you need to show has a weird
pattern which is hard to
describe. Are you thinking the
same I am? That's right! The
Relic Fragment! Apparently,
Wigglytuff and Chatot have
already seen that logo before.
Where was it? Brine Cave! But
you guys must be careful...
there's a strong Pokemon inside.
One adventage? Good, old Chatot
will be with you.

Go to Treasure Town to get
ready. Team Skull will meet
Torkoal and talk with him.
Before going to Brine Cave, we
should see if Grovyle is back,
so go to Sharpedo Bluff. Grovyle
is not there, but there's a
note. He's Ok, he has 3 Time
Gears already. Looks like Azelf
cooperated and more people is
trusting him. Still, he doesn't
wants to be near Treasure Town
because Dusknoir may return. He
may go to Sharpedo Bluff or the
beach tho. Since he's not in
Sharpedo Bluff, you should check
the beach. Let's go!


 ==================
7.18 CHAPTER 18: LAPRAS
 ==================

Go to the beach, no Grovyle!
Awwwts! Check the sunset though!
Your partner realizes that if
the time stops, there won't be
more sunsets. He's a genious!
You start remembering old times,
when you guys were nubcakes.
Your partner will notice a
Pokemon on the Sea. It's a
Lapras. Oh well, time to return
to the guild for dinner.

Little Movie: Wigglytuff talking
with Lapras. Seems like they
know each other really well.

Next Morning... Loudred..

::Save Point::

Wigglytuff is not there, so
Chatot (¿?) will lead us to
Brine Cave...

Objective: Reach the deepest
part of Brine Cave.

You'll team up with Chatot.

You'll get to a little Room,
where you can see Team Skull all
pwned. They give you the Relic
Fragment. They weren't that
bad... Go to the next room!
Chatot is alone there!!

Be careful... there're pokemon
close... Look up!

You'll see 1 Nasty Kabutops and
2 ugly Omastar...

They'll go down and try to
attack you, but Chatot protects
you and he receives the attack.
One Omastar remembers Chatot
from the last expedition. Come
on! Chatot is risking his life
for you guys to have a chance!
Don't mess it up!!


7.18.2 Boss Battle: Kabutops


--------------------KABUTOPS----

HP: Less than 380

Strategy:

Use a X-eye seed on Kabutops.
While he's dancing, eliminate
the 2 Omastar, they should suck.
After pwning the Omastars, throw
Gravelerocks at Kabutops if you
don't have a long range attack.
That should do it. Repeat the
process.


--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

---------------------KABUTOPS---


After one tough battle, they'll
leave. Go to check Chatot! OMG!
He's badly hurt!! Wigglytuff and
Grovyle will arrive and a second
after them the whole guild.
Everyone is worried about
Chatot, looks like it's the
second time he receives the
impact to save a friend. First
Time was with Wigglytuff. Chatot
feels proud and then he faints.
He's close to die... so he
better return to the guild. Your
Partner, Grovyle and you should
keep going tho, otherwise
Chatot's efforts would be
useless. You'll reach a rocky
section by the sea. On the wall,
you'll see the Relic Fragment
pattern. Your partner will place
the Relic Fragment on the floor
and the Pattern will start
shining and a light will appear.
Lapras will arrive. Apparently,
he's the messenger of Hidden
Land. Hidden Land is across the
sea, so get on!


 ===============================
7.19 CHAPTER 19: TO THE HIDDEN
  LAND
 ===============================


To reach the Hidden Land, you
must go through a gap of time.
Want to know a lil bit about the
expedition Chatot and WT had in
Brine Cave? Looks like Chatot
was the shield that protected
Wigglytuff from being pwned.
Still, WT is one tough
Pokemon... so he defeated
Kabutops and the Omastar. Since
Chatot was badly hurt, Lapras
helped him and Lapras made WT
promise that he wouldn't reveal
the Hidden Land. Now something
about the Relic Fragment. It is
said that it chooses someone
with a good heart to be it's
owner. That's your partner! By
now you've probably reached the
Hidden Land portal. Lapras will
start flying and cross the sea
of time. You'll reach Hidden
Land and the first thing you'll
notice is that the Temporal
Towerr is located on the Sky! To
reach it, you must have the
Rainbow Stoneship, which can be
found in the Old Ruins. I
reccomend reaching level 36+
before going there. If you're
not, return to Treasure Town by
talking to Lapras.

Once you reach the Old Ruins,
you'll see images of Mew,
Kyogre, Groudon, Palkia and
Dialga. You'll notice that
there's that weird pattern
again. You'll get to a
 place with a tablet. Something
 is written there, but it's in
 Unown Language...
Oh no... what are you gus
supposed to do now? Super
Grovyle to the rescue!!! The
inscription says "This is
Rainbow Stoneship, put the Relic
Fragment in the hole"

Hmmm, I'm pretty sure that's
what said.

When you're about to put the
Relic Fragment in the hole,
Dusknoir and Sableye Squad will
appear. They take you to another
yard where a Dimensional Hole is
located.

You know this time had to come
right? Time to fight against
all-mighty Dusknoir


7.19.2 Boss Battle: Dusknoir


--------------------DUSKNOIR----

HP: Less than 650

Strategy:

Sableyes are a pain in the ass
too. They are 6! SIX! They have
low HP tho, about 90 each one so
you are probably able to OHKO
them.

Try to sleep, confuse or inflict
any status to Dusknoir.


--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

---------------------DUSKNOIR---


After defeating Dusknoir, he
won't accept it. He'll try to
suck you guys with his stomach
but you return his attack.

After that attack, Dusknoir gets
pwned by sure. The Saleye Squad
will be afraid of you guys and
they will return to the future
by the dimensional hole. Grovyle
will tell your partner to insert
the Relic Fragment. Dusknoir
will wake up and tells something
you surely don't want to hear.
Apparently, if you save the
Temporal Tower, all the Pokemon
from the future will dissapear.
That includes Grovyle, Dusknoir,
Celebi and you. You will realize
that you have no choice. Grovyle
will give a speech about your
partner.

::Save Point::

Your partner will activate the
Rainbow Stoneship. Dusknoir will
surprise you by using an attack,
but Grovyle becomes your shield.
Grovyle will make Dusknoir go
back to the future by going with
him. Pretty sad moment. He'll
give you the Time Gears he got
and remember that you and your
partner are the greatest
combination... bye Grovyle!
Thanks for everything!



 ===============================
7.20 FINAL CHAPTER: THE LAST
  ADVENTURE
 ===============================


Get on the Rainbow Stoneship.
You'll start flying and you get
to your destiny. Yes, Temporal
Tower. You'll see a Kanghaskan
Statue.

READ THIS:

You can return to Treasure Town,
but if you do it, you'll have to
get through Hidden Land again
WITHOUT Grovyle.

If you decide to return to
Treasure Town, buy lots of
Reviver Seeds, Berries and if
you have a Brick Break, teach it
to any of your Pokemon.

You can also do missions. Once
you're done, talk to Lapras. You
can find him at the beach.

When you reach to the Temporal
Pinnacle, the sky will be full
of thunders. Keep going until
you see a pedestal. There's a
big circular pattern with 5
holes. Yes, the Time Gears. When
your partner is about to insert
them, a thunder will fall and
everything will be black. You'll
hear a voice saying you wanna
destroy the Temporal Tower, so
you're going to be pwned.

CarlosPit note:
GROOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Primal Dialga'll appear. He just
won't listen! Wait a second!
That Primal Dialga is not as
Dark as the one you saw in the

There's still hope! Fight! This
is... SPARTA!!

------------------PRIMAL DIALGA-

HP: Less than 800

Strategy:

Use fighting moves or Ice moves.
If you don't have Reviver seeds,
I won't lie... it's going to be
tough. Try using different seeds
on him and use long range
attacks. Be careful of Roar of
time, since he can use ti
anywhere and it'll cause major
dmg on your Pokemon. He won't
OHKO you unless it's a critical
hit.

won't stop! Why?!?!?

Where you guys too late? Waaa!!
Thunder!!

...

...

...

You'll wake up with your partner
next to you, but where are you?
Dialga has the answer. It's
Temporal Tower. It hasn't
collapsed. You saved it.
Dialga's recover his reason.
Time is running again! Temporal
Tower is badly damaged, but it
won't collapse.


"The world's peace has been
restored"

You guys did it! It's time to
return to Treasure Town!

::Save Point::

When you're returning, you'll
feel your body really heavy. You
know what is happening right?
Could it be? Your time has
arrived? Light'll start comming
out from your body... yes...
your time with your partner...
is over... is it?

I won't mess such an awesome
ending. Enjoy!


:::Congrats!! You finished the

happy and don't want to be
disturbed... BUT, my mission
here is to inform you that there
is a Post-Storyline! Happy?

I AM!

8.- POST-STORYLINE
--------------------------------


"As a result of Timatria's and
Dinasty's heroic actions, the
destruction of the time was
stopped and peace returned to
the world of Pokemon. Of course,
not everything returned to
normal right away. Some Places
remained where time was still
out of control, but things were
becoming better everywhere. As
for Timatria and Dinasty... They
returned to Wigglytuff's Guild
and fell back
     into their daily routine of
     vigorous training. One
     morning, several months
     later..."

8.1 CHAPTER 21: FINALLY...
  GRADUATION
 ===============================

Zomg! It's your graduation day!
Congratulations! Of course, you
will graduate if you get through
your last mission, which is
investigating Luminous Spring,
which is the place where Pokemon
once went to Evolve.

But apparently, is not that
easy. Loudred failed the exam.
LOL!

Ok, what your're supposed to do
is bringing the treasure, but a
strong enemy lives there... and
his name is... The Grand Master
of All Bad Things!

Go to Treasure Town so you can
get ready. When you get there,
you'll meet Teddiursa and
Ursaring. You'll wonder where
are they going, and it turns out
that they are going to
Mystifying Forest, which is the
dungeon where the Luminous
Spring is located. You warn them
saying that in the Mystifying
Forest lives the Grand Master of
All Bad Things, but they will
reply saying that they go there
and play all the time. That's
weird isn't it? Well, time to go
there.

               FOREST-----------
               ---------


After those 18 floors, you'll
get to the Mystifying Forest
Clearing. Once you're there,
you'll meet with Teddiursa and
Ursaring and it looks like they
are going to Luminous Spring
too! Yay!

Go with them, BUT DON'T STEP ON
THE TRAP!!

You stepped on it right?

You'll fall into a Dark Place...
and you'll hear a voice.

Holy Sheezcakes! It's the Grand
Master of All Bad Things!! Am I
right?

No, I'm wrong... looks like it
is Wigglytuff and the whole
guild...

How do I know that? Because
Bidoof messed it up! Lol!

Even Though you know that
Wigglytuff is the one in there,
he'll keep saying he's the Grand
Master of All Bad Things and the
clan members are like his
minions.

Time to Battle the Grand Master
of All Bad Things!


---------------WIGGLYTUFF'S
               GUILD------------
               -------

Wigglytuff's HP: 800

Strategy:

You will not only fight against
Wigglytuff, you'll fight against
ALL the guild! That means
Chatot, Sunflora, Loudred, etc.
This can be pretty hard since
you're only 2 and they are like
6. You may want to try using an
X-Eye Seed against Wigglytuff,
since It will make Wigglytuff
start walking around the room,
and since he has no long range
attacks, he will be out of the
battle for some turns.

Most of the Guild Members will
die with 1 attack, but Chatot
will may be a little harder. Be
careful of his Fury Attack.

Try to use Fighting Moves
against Wigglytuff. Fortunately,
WT doesn't have strong attacks,
so it shouldn't be THAT hard.

::Save Point::


Meet with Ursaring and
Teddiursa, there will be a box
in front of you guys. Your
partner will ask you to use your
Dimensional Scream to find out
if it's dangerous. After using
it, you'll discover that
Wigglytuff was the one who
placed it there. Ok, so it's ok
to open it. Try to guess what's
inside. Let's see. What's the
1st thing you think about when I
say Wigglytuff? That's right. A
Perfect Apple! That actually
suits Wigglytuff. A light will
appear. It's the Luminous
Spring! Teddiursa goes there and
he evolves into a Ursaring.
Cool! Your partner wants to
evolve too, but nothing happens
because there's a distortion of
space going on with you and your
partner. Soo... both of you guys
can't evolve. Go back to the
guild.

Once you're back in the Guild,
they will deny everything! But
Congratz! You've graduated from
the guild! You know what's the
best part? They still keep most
of your money! Yay! Oh yea, and
there are no more obligated
missions.


 "The Exploration Team
 Federation has send a message"

"Timatria's Team was rewarded
with an enlarged Treasure Bag!"

"Also, as start-up for the newly
affiliated team, the guild sent
Team HostleX a
    whooping 10,000 coins."

   "Congratulations Team
   HostleX! You graduated!"


Some Things have changed now
you've graduated. You can't use
the room of your guild anymore,
so you'll sleep in Sharpedo
Bluff. Try going back to the
guild and you'll meet Chimecho.
He'll explain you that now
you're in a 1st Rate Exploration
Team, you can choose your own
Team Leader, since it always
were you. You can go now to Zero
Isle, it's a pretty tough
Dungeon so be ready if you're
planning to go there.

Ok now, go to the Marohwak Dojo,
once there, you'll feel a
tremor. Go inside the Dojo and
you'll find a new Entrance.
Inside it, there's a warp point
that sends you to the Final
Maze, which is not that hard,
but it ain't easy either.

Also, sometimes you visit the
Bulleting Board, you'll see some
jobs with "?????" as location,
accept them to have new dungeons
available.



 ===============================
8.2 CHAPTER 22: SCIZOR THE
  EXPLORER
 ===============================


There should be a Mr. Mime by
the Kecleons Brothers Shop, talk
to him. He'll explain you that
there used to be a great
explorer named Scizor. Once he
went to a dungeon located in
Blizzard Island, but he never
returned. You can now go to
Blizzard Island.

After that, you will hear a
voice. It's Frosslass and he was
the one who froze Scizor.

Time to Battle!


-------------------FROSSLASS----

HP: 760

Strategy:

Oh Come On! You've defeated
Primal Dialga, you've defeated
the entire guild and you can't
beat this Pushover? Oh That's
impossible! He only has 760 HP
so he shouldn't be tough at all.

Once you defeat him, he'll
dissapear and Scizor will be
free. Scizor will remember what
happened and he will introduce
himself.

Back in Treasure Town, Scizor
will thank you guys again. He
wants to give you a reward but
he has no coins, but since you
guys are an Exploration Team,
he'll award you with the Secret
Rank, he can do that because he
is a Honorary Member of the
Pokemon Exploration Team
Federation.

W00t! Secret Rank! What is it
for? I don't know but it sounds
awesome!!




 ======================
8.3   CHAPTER 23: MANAPHY
 ======================


Some days later, go talk to
Sunflora. If I'm not wrong,
she's in the guild. She will say
something about Surrounded Sea.
It is said that there's
something that should be
explored.

Now you can go there! Surrounded
Sea, here we go!

Once you reach the floor number
20, you'll find a weird egg and
3 boxes. When you're done
gathering those 4 items, step on
the Warp Point to leave the
dungeon.

Next Morning, the egg will be
glowing with a mystical light.
Woah! It's moving! It's
hatching! Yay! Wait. What the
F.. is that? It's actually kinda
cool! Since you guys have no
idea what kind of pokemon it is,
you should go talk to Chatot.
He's one wise Pokemon. Chatot
will explain you guys that the
cute thingy that hatched from
the egg is a Manaphy. Manaphy is
an extremely rare Pokemon! All
of a sudden, Manaphy will start
crying. Maybe he's hungry? You
should go get some Blue Gummies,
since that's the favorite gummi
for the Water-Type Pokemons.
Blue Gummies can be found in
Craggy Coast.

Go to Craggy Coast and if God
loves you, you will find a Blue
Gummi, but if he REALLY loves
you, you will find two.

Once you have the gummies, you
must go back to the guild. After
giving TWO Blue Gummies to
Manaphy, he will be sattisfied
and fall asleep. Let him sleep!
You meanie!

Next Morning, Manaphy will call
you guys by your names. Zomg!
How Cute! Well, what should we
do with the "Goomi Dude" today?
Maybe the beach?

"And so, Manaphy, Timatria and
Dinasty played until the sunset.
That night.."


Next Morning. Hi Mana...

CarlosPit Note: LOL!

Nooes! He's gone! Why God
Why?!?!? Go to the beach!! While
going there, you will meet
Chatot. When you tell him that
Manaphy is gone, he'll go look
for him in the guild. You go to
the beach. Once you reach the
beach, you'll see Manaphy, but
he will faint. He has a high
fever. Chatot will appear and he
will be mad! Looks like the only
way to save him is going to
Miracle Sea and meet Phione. He
will give you the Phione Dew.

When you get to the Miracle
Seabeed, you will see lots of
Phiones. They are singing and
having fun! Some seconds laters,
a Gyarados will appear. He wants
the Phione Dew! He's such a
bullie! Time to pwn him!



-------------------GYARADOS-----

HP: 650

Strategy:

This is not a hard boss. He just
looks ugly. That's it. Dragon,
Lightning and Electric Attacks
are reccomended.


--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

Timatria = 50

---------------------GYARADOS---


Once you pwn him, he'll run like
a coward. As a reward, the
Phione Clan will give you the
Phione's Dew. You must give that
the Manaphy!

As soon as you give the Phione's
Dew to Manaphy, he will feel
better. Ok, so that's cool.

Several days later, Manaphy will
be fully recovered. It's time
for Manaphy to go back to the
sea. Walrein will take care of
him so he should be ok.

Bye Manaphy! Take Care! Don't
forget to make your bed!

Snnifle.



  ============================
8.4   CHAPTER 24: THE AEGIS CAVE
  ============================


After some days go to the guild.
It's going to be empty. Go to
the second floor to find the
WHOLE guild around Medicham,
Loppuny and Gardevoir. They're
Team Charm. They are Treasure
Hunters and they've reached the
Master Rank. So, what the hell
are they doing there? Who Knows?
Wigglytuff will appear saying
hi. Looks like Wigglytuff used
to be a member of Team Charm!

Apparently, on one of their
expeditions, they found a Key
and Wigglytuff kept it. That key
fits somewhere in Aegis Cave and
it is said that there's a big
treasure there. Wigglytuff
doesn't remembers about that
key. Hmm. Team Charm is MAD
because they put a lot of effort
on getting that key. Soo, Team
Charm decides to give Wigglytuff
a gift. Let me guess. Perfect
Apple? Zomg I was right! After
receiving the Perfect Apple,
Wigglytuff will remember where
he left the key.

"Yoooooooooooooo...
TAH!!!!!!!!!!"

There it is! One in shape of an
Unown. You should join Team
Charm while they explore the
Aegis Cave!

You better get ready! Get some
Reviver Seeds.

Go to the Aegis Cave and you'll
meet with the guys and with the
guild crew.

--------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE:

Let me help you save some time.
You'll need the following rocks:

One:

*R
*O
*K
*T
*S
*I
*L

Two:

*C

Three:

*E

--------------------------------


Ok, so your first Dungeon: Ice
Aegis Cave.

obtained by defeating the
Unowns.

Ok after finding the 3 letters
(I-C-E), you must get through
the 3 floors and read the
inscription in the statue, close
your eyes and be ready to party!


8.4.2 Boss Battle: REGICE


--------------------REGICE------

HP: Less than 650

Strategy:

Ok this ain't a hard Pokemon.
You just have to inflict as much
damage as you can. I mean, by
this point, your Team prolly
inflicts between 100 and 150
Damage by Hit. So in... 4 turns
more less, he should be pwned.


--------------------------------

HostleX team:

Level :

Timatria = 50
Dinasty = 50


---------------------REGICE-----


After defeating the All Mighty
Regice, a mysterious light will
envelop you. A passage will now
be open, so all you have to do
is walking. You'll see a statue
and, a few seconds later, Team
Charm will appear. Looks like
they're very proud of your team,
but they still wanna reach the
Treasure before you guys do!

And we're off to the Regirock
Cave!

10.3 Throw Items [throw]


These items only serve one
purpose: to be thrown at enemies
and hit from a range. Very
useful. Instead of listing what
they do (since they all do
 damage), I'll just list them
 and any special traits.

Geo Pebble - Deals a set 10
Damage

Gravelrock - Deals a set 20
Damage Iron Thorn

Rare Fossil - Deals a set 100
Damage Silver Spike



10.4 Stick Food [food]


These items are used to fill the
Belly of a Pokemon so they don't
starve to death. Some also even
increase the size of the Belly!

Apple-Fills belly by 50

Big Apple-Fills belly by 100

Golden Apple-Fills belly to max

Grimmy Food-Fills belly by 33

Huge Apple-Fills Belly to max



10.5 Drinks [drink]


These are basically your
vitamins from the other games.
Drink sparingly, as besides the
Max Elixir, they are rare. The
stat (not IQ) boosting ones give
a stat boost of 3 to said stat.


Calcium-Raises Sp. Attack

Ginseng-Raises the power of your
selected move (L+A) by 1,
   or sometimes 3

Iron-Raises Defense

Max Elixir-Refills PP of all
moves

Nectar-Raises IQ

Protein-Raises Attack

Zinc-Raises Sp. Defense



10.6 Berries/Seeds [plant]


Berries are a wonderful food,
and also have effects to help
you. Seeds can be tossed for
some damage, or eaten for
special effects, as well as
refilling your belly a bit. For
Seeds, if they give negative
effects, eating them will give
you the effect. That's never
good. Instead, throw those
seeds, and the target that gets
hit will be affected by it. I
will mark good and bad
conditions with a [+] or [-],
respectively. SO you want to use
the [+] ones on yourself, and
the [-]ones should be thrown.


{{Berries}}

Cheri Berry-Cures paralysis

Chesto Berry-Gives Sleepless
status, preventing you from
going to sleep

Oran Berry-Restores 100HP

Pecha Berry-Curse Poison

Rawst Berry-Curse Burn

Sitrus Berry-Restores 100HP


{{Seeds}}

Blast Seed [?]-When eaten hits
for 35 Damage in front. When
thrown,
         does 25 Damage

Blinker Seed [-]-Cannot see
items or other Pokemon

Doom Seed [-]-Lowers level by 1

Eyedrop Seed [+]-Makes traps and
invisble Pokemon visible

Golden Seed [+]-Makes you gain 5
levels.

Heal Seed [+]-Removes all
negative status effects

Hunger Seed [-]-Reduces max
belly by 5

Joy Seed [+]-Makes you gain 1
level

Life Seed [+]-Gives +3 Max HP
permanently

Plain Seed-Does NOTHING

Pure Seed [?]-Warps eater to
stairs

Reviver Seed [+]-Revives

Sleep Seed [-]-Puts eater to
sleep

and Sp. Defense to 1

Violent Seed [+]-Maxes out
Attack and Sp. Attack

Warp Seed [?]-Warps eater to
random spot on the floor

X-Eye Seed [-]-Makes vision
blurry



10.7 Gummis [candy]


Gummis are little treats for
Pokemon. They come in many
colors, and each type likes a
specific color the most. When
you give a Pokemon a Gummi, it
raises their IQ. It raises it
more if they like it. If in a
Dungeon, you have a chance to
increase a stat randomly by 1.
In my travels, I have found they
are most commonly found in
Marine Resort, in assorted
flavors. Final Maze also seems
to have a semi-decent amount.


Black Gummi-Favored by Dark-
types

Blue Gummi-Favored by Water-
types

Brown Gummi-Favored by Ground-
types

Clear Gummi-Favored by Ice-types

Gold Gummi-Favored by Psychic-
types

Grass Gummi-Favored by Grass-
types

Gray Gummi-Favored by Rock-types

Green Gummi-Favored by Bug-types

Orange Gummi-Favored by
Fighting-types

Pink Gummi-Favored by Poison-
types

Purple Gummi-Favored by Ghost-
types

Red Gummi-Favored by Fire-types

Royal Gummi-Favored by Dragon-
types

Silver Gummi-Favored by Steel-
types

Sky Gummi-Favored by Flying-
types

White Gummi-Favored by Normal-
types

Wonder Gummi-Favored by all
types

Yellow Gummi-Favored by
Electric-types


10.8 Orbs [orbs]


Orbs are magical little do-dads.
They can do just about anything
you can imagine that isn't
overly cheap (sorry, no Floor
Skip, Boss Destruction, or
Catcher Orbs). Also, Orbs cannot
be used in Boss Rooms so all
you've got in those fights are
Seeds and your raw power/skill
(good things some orbs have Seed
equivalents, like the Totter
Orb/Seed). Orbs can be found in
any dungeon, so I won't list
locations unless I feel it's
important.

10.9 HMs [moves]

HMs are just like TMs, but they
don't break. Below are locations
of all HMs. HMs cannot be earned
in dungeons. Also, this is how I
will display HMs:

Name - Type - PPAttack Power
(AP) - Accuracy (Acc.)-Info

Dojo Final Maze, on random
floors. Just gotta get lucky.

really.

11.- WONDER MAILS
--------------------------------

Here I'll post some Wonder Mails
for you to unlock all the
Dungeons.

I'll also post some Wonder Mails
for some Items you probably want
to adquire since with them you
can have a higher recruitment %.

Notice that I'm getting most of
this information from Drayano's
guide. He was kind enough to let
me use the information of his
guide. Thanks a lot.
