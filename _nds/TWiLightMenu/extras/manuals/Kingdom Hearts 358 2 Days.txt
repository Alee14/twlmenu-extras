I'm going keep this guide
spoiler free, so I won't be
discussing any events relating
to the story. You can skip
cutscenes by pressing start then
pick the second option ("Skip").
As for missions, you can quit by
pausing the game and picking the
second option ("Retire"). You'll
be taken back to headquarters
when you do so.

Anyway, you'll be asked to
select your desired difficulty
setting when you start a new
game in Story Mode. The choices
are as follows: Beginner Mode
[ビギナ一モ一ド]; Standard Mode
[スタンダ一ドモ一ド]; and Proud Mode
[プラウドモ一ド]. After that, pick the
left option to confirm.

This day begins with a very
brief tutorial on how to save
your game -- simply open the
main menu, then choose save (2nd
to the last option). You may
save anytime when you're in HQ,
but you won't be able to do so
while you're in the middle of a
mission, so you'll have to
complete whatever it was you
were doing then return home
first. Anyway, feel free to talk
to the other guys if you like.
When you're all set to proceed,
talk to Saix (the guy with blue
hair) and choose the first
option.

Mission 01 - Twilight Town

In Twilight Town, follow Axel
for a tutorial (remember that
you can also control the camera
through the touchscreen). Your
goal for this mission is to
locate a treasure chest. Now,
head for the upper central area
and activate the switch. This
should unlock a nearby gate.
Make your way up along the
eastern path. Another tutorial
will be given, this time about
"Area Blocks". Basically, any
area that has nothing to do with
your current mission will be
sealed off.

When you regain control, go
further up to find your
treasure; it contains a POTION
[ポーション]. Go back to the dark
portal, examine it, and pick the
first option to go home.

The "Reports" option will now be
accessible in the main menu; you
can view Roxas' Diary and the
Enemy Report from there. Talk to
the other organization members
if you wish to. Otherwise, just
go talk to Saix for the next
mission.

Mission 02 - Twilight Town

Marluxia will be joining you
this time. Three separate groups
of Heartless will appear in
between dialogues. Simply kill
off everything to clear this
mission.

Nothing much to do here, so just
talk to Saix for your mission.

Mission 03 - Twilight Town

Your goal for this one is to
defeat 7 Heartless. The mission
completes once you've done that,
and you can go back home. Though
you might want to stick around
and defeat every single
Heartless in the area to max out
the mission gauge. Doing so will
give you greater experience
points as well as better
rewards.

There is a chest with a POTION
[ポーション] just down the stairs to
the east of your portal. Don't
forget to claim that one before
leaving.

You will be able to access the
"Panel Slot" option in the main
menu now. So open it and equip
the 3 Fire spells you got from
the previous mission. You may
want to bring along some Potions
as well. Take note that you must
fill the panel tiles with the
stuff you want to take with you.
Otherwise, you won't be able to
use them at all, and you can't
access those panels in the
middle of a mission either.

Also, to assign shortcut buttons
to magic spells, open the magic
command menu, pick a spell, hold
L to open the shortcut menu,
then press the button you wish
to use as a shortcut to the
spell. Once you're ready talk to
Saix.

Mission 04 - Twilight Town

You may want to experiment with
your new magic. Choose Magic
[まほう] from the command menu
(press X to cycle between
commands), then choose the spell
you want to cast; though you
only have Fire right now, so
there's not much choice to make.
Kill off the Heartless with
magic or normal attacks to clear
the mission. Don't forget to
collect the ETHERS from the
chests around the area as well.

If Roxas happened to gain level,
and you're wondering why his
level didn't increase, press Y
to access the panel menu. Notice
that there is now an LV tile in
your inventory. You must equip
that one in order for the level
up to take effect. Talk to Saix
for the next mission.

Mission 05 - Twilight Town

This one requires you to
investigate, and so you'll have
to look out for clues. A "?"
will appear over Roxas' head
whenever you're near a
suspicious spot. Look around the
area until the green target
marker appears to examine the
clue. The clue locations are
listed below.

* The clothing stall just some
  ways south of your portal.
* The jewelry shop to the
  southwest of your portal
* The ground further north of
  the jewelry shop.
* The stall directly north of
  the third clue.

A short event will occur after
this. When prompted for a
response, pick the first option
twice. Time to look for the next
set of clues.

* The vents at the southeast
  corner of the Tram Station.
* The vents of the upper east
  building.
* The stone wall "staircase"
  east of the last clue.

The mission should be complete
now, but there are a couple more
clues to find. Here are the
locations.

* From your portal, go south
  then down the stairs.
* The wall at the northeast-most
  corner of the Tram Station.

drill to proceed to your next
mission.

Mission 06 - Twilight Town

Defeat the Mega Shadow using
either normal attacks or limit
break. To use a limit break: Get
your HP down to critical and the
word "Limit" will appear
somewhere near your HP gauge.
When this happens, highlight the
attack command and hold "A". A
short sequence will play, then
press A again when you regain
control to unleash the attack.
The Mega Shadow should fall
rather quickly.

clear this mission. Go ahead and
try to max out the mission gauge
when possible.

for an ETHER [エーテル]. After that,
talk to Saix for some new
missions. There will be 3 in
total. The first 2 will be in
Twilight Town and the last one
will be in The World that Never
Was. I'll be covering them in
order from 8 to 10.

Mission 08 - Twilight Town

Your goal here is to eliminate
all Surveillance Heartless in
the town. The target's picture
is displayed at the bottom
screen. Just go through the
accessible areas and you'll
eventually get to a spot where
all 4 of your targets are
located. Kill all of them to
finish this mission.

Mission 09 - Twilight Town

You need to kill all the Weed
Plant Heartless, which can be
found at the Mansion Gates. Once
you get back to the Tram
Station, you'll receive a
warning about the presence of an
extra powerful Heartless. You
need to kill that one to max out
the mission gauge.

The Rolling Soldier has a lot of
HP. Hit it a few times then roll
away as the enemy spins. It will
have a brief stun period after
this. So you can land some free
hits. Keep repeating this until
it dies.

Mission 10 - The World That
Never Was

This one is simple. Kill as many
Dusks as you can in 60 seconds.
That should do it for this
mission.

then continue to the next area.
At the Underground Concourse,
head south along the right path
first to find one more POTION.
Next, hop onto the higher
platform near the bottom of the
area. Activate the switch here
and go through the nearby gate.
Jump off to the lower section to
grab an ARMED GEAR [アムードギア] from
the chest. Now, continue along
the west path and press the next
switch. Proceed to the next
area.

The Guardian Heartless you're
seeking should be here. Kill off
all the Surveillance first
before dealing with your main
target. Just side step when you
see the creature prepare to fire
a giant beam.

A new entry will be added to
Roxas' diary. Equip the link
panel you got from the previous
mission. Notice that there is a
number on the link panel (2).
This means that any magic spell
you place in the tiles within
the link panel's covered area
will be multiplied by 2. So if
you place 3 Fire spells in
there, you'll get to cast Fire 6
times instead of just 3.

Also, the circled number at the
end of the link panel's name
indicates the panel's total link
area (this one says 4, so it
covers 4 tiles). Talk to Demyx
for a BLAZING SHARD, then to
Saix for your next mission.

Mission 12 - Twilight Town

Your target is the Poison Plant,
which is waiting at the Tunnel
(south exit of the Underground
Concourse. It is very weak to
Fire and even gets burned
sometimes. Cast Fire on it a few
times to get this done quickly.

before you go, turn around first
and grab a POWER UNIT L [パワーユニット

Continue on to the Sandlot. The
Deserters have very little HP,
but they move fast, so time your
attacks carefully.

area. That should give you a bit
of boost in attack power. Talk
to Xaldin for a MOONSTONE, then
to Saix.

Mission 14 - Twilight Town

Your goal for this mission is to
defeat Darkside. Open the
treasure chests containing
POTIONS along the way. As for
Darkside, just jump and hit
whatever body part you can
reach. Its attacks are quite
easy to avoid, and does not do
much damage even if you do get
hit.

then to the floating moogle at
the lobby to access the shop,
where you will see these
options: Buy [かう], Sell [うる],
Panel Synthesis [パネル合成], Quit
[やめる].

You can purchase stuff through
the "Buy" tab using Heart
Points. The "Panel Synthesis"
tab lets you create new
items/equipment by expending a
specific amount of synth items
and of course munny. The items
needed for synthesis are
displayed on the top screen. Buy
the Slot Unlock [スロット開放] and
Level Up [LVアップ] at the shop.
Talk to Saix for your next
mission.

Mission 15 - Agrabah

This will be your very first to
Agrabah, and this is another one
of those missions that requires
you to investigate. You start
out at the Palace Gates; grab a
CURE ALL [オールキュア] from the chest
to the west of your portal.

Again, a "?" will appear over
Roxas' head whenever you're
close to a suspicious area. Look
around there until the green
target marker appears, then you
can check the clue.

* The first clue is the small
  sand incline to the north of
  your portal.
* Check the large gates then
  attack the lever to open the
  exit.
* Check the wooden planks near
  the exit.
* The empty stall southeast of
  the area.
* The colorful plates at the
  southwest stall. Off to next
  screen.

Hop up the higher platform at
the southeast corner and make
your way around to a treasure
chest with a POTION [ポーション].
There is also a chest with an
OMINOUS GEAR [オミナスギア] here,
which you can't get until later.

* Check the platform near the
  chest you just opened.
* The sand incline next to the
  destructible pot.
* The colorful plates at the
  stall south of area.
* The sand spot next to the
  stall you just checked.
* Attack the lone crate to push
  it next to the pile of crates,
  and jump to the top. Check the
  rope on the plank for another
  clue.
* The discolored wall near the
  rope.

After the last clue, make your
way to the end and hit the lever
there. This will open the south
gate. Take that one out to the
Palace Gates.

* The sand dune at the southeast
  corner of the area.
* The barred door at the central
  west portion of the Plaza.
* Go further west from the last
  clue and check the discolored
  wall.

Make your way up to the
northeast corner to find a chest
with a POTION [ポーション]. Next hop
onto the green awning and
navigate along the upper level
to the southwest for another
POTION [ポーション]. Return to the
Palace Gates for a scene. You
can't go through the main exit,
so go back to the Bazaar and go
through the northeast exit at
the upper level.

The mission completes after the
event between Aladdin and
Jasmine. You can go back home
now, but there are a few more
clues to find.

* The first one is the massive
  door at the Palace Gates.
* The wooden planks near the
  Bazaar's entrance.
* Head to the Plaza and check
  the exit blocked by a
  sandstorm.

When you finally regain control
of Roxas after all the
cutscenes, talk to Demyx twice
to get a Shining Light Shard
[光かがやくかけら]. New entries will be
added to Roxas' Diary as well.
Talk to Saix and he'll have 4
new missions for you. I'll cover
them in order from 16 to 19.

Mission 16 - Agrabah

Your goal is to kill all 7 Fire
Plants -- there are 2 at the
Palace Gates; 2 at the Bazaar,
and 3 at the Palace Walls .
Begin by picking up the ARMED
GEAR + [アームドギア+] from a chest at
the gates, then move on to the
next area. There, grab take the
POTION [ポーション] and ETHER [エーテル]
from both chests.

Come back later when you have
High Jump to claim a DIAMOND
[ダイヤモンド] from a chest in the
Bazaar.

For the targets at the Palace
Walls, you'll have to kill the
Barrier Master first, since it
casts Protect on the plants. Hit
it to knock the book away then
spam the creature with magic.
Take out the flowers afterwards.

Back at base, talk to Saix and
he'll give you a LV2+ [LV2プラス]
link panel. All the level up
panels you place in the link
area will boost your level by 2.

Mission 17 - Twilight Town

Continue onwards for 2 screens
to the Tram Station. There, look
around the area for a CURE ALL
[オールキュア] and BLAZING SHARD
[燃え上がるかけら]. Don't attack the
Tail Bunker head on; try to go
around behind it and attack the
tail.

Mission 18 - Agrabah

Look around the Palace Walls for
2 treasures: POTION [ポーション] and
ETHER [エーテル]. Collect the
emblems in every area. Try to
kill enemies first to make the
emblems glow before you collect
them. That should fill the
mission gauge faster.

Mission 19 - Agrabah

Collect a POTION [ポーション] and
SLOT UNLOCK [スロット開放] at the
Bazaar, along with an ETHER
[エーテル] at the Palace Gates. Kill
all the Deserters at the Palace
Gates to clear mission.

Mission 21 - Agrabah

Grab the POTION [ポーション] in the
Palace Gates. Time for a bit of
spying mission until Pete finds
the secret passage to the Cave
of Wonders.

Your goal is to follow Pete
around, making sure he doesn't
step out of the blue zone; you
must not step into his territory
(red zone) either. You will hear
a "squeak" if you fail. The best
way to do this is to follow
behind him as close as you can,
being careful not to step into
the red zone. This will make
sure you don't get caught in the
red when he suddenly turns
around. Do this for a while
until Pete reaches the Plaza.

A dialogue between Axel and
Roxas should occur. When Pete
leaves, go back to the Bazaar
for a POTION [ポーション], then pick
up the SHINING LIGHT SHARD
[光かがやくかけら] at the Palace Walls.
Follow Pete into the new
passage. You should emerge at
the entrance to the Cave of
Wonders. Grab the POTION [ポーション]
and proceed into the cave.

Inside, go find the lone crate
and push it close to the bronze
statue. Climb to the higher
platform and hit the lever to
open an exit. Now, start hitting
the gold statue to push it
towards the north wall, then
move your crate next to the gold
statue. Use these as a makeshift
staircase to get atop the wall.
Don't forget to kill all the
Heartless that you see. Continue
to the next area.

Clear the area of enemies and a
Large Body will appear. Get rid
of that one to complete the
mission. Head to the northeast
corner of the area and hit the
swith there. This should get the
platforms moving. Use these
platforms to reach the higher
exit to the west. Grab an IRON
[アイアン] from the chest and
continue to the next area.

In this room, check the lower
area for a chest with an IRON
[アイアン]. The switch opens the
gate directly ahead, which you
can't access yet. So just into
the pit. You'll end up on the
upper level of the very first
area of the cave. Clear all the
Heartless to max out the mission
gauge. Grab a POTION [ポーション]
from the treasure chest here. Go
on home.

raises the level of all spells
within the link area to 2, and
multiplies their level with the
number of spells in the link
area. So if you put 2 Fire
spells in there, you get to cast
2 shots of level 4 Fire spells.

Talk to Xaldin; he wants to
trade his Frost Shard to Blaze
Shard. Give him one if you like.
Talk to Saix and leave for
Beast's Castle.

Mission 22 - Beast's Castle

At the bridge, open both chests
for a GUARD UP L [ガードアップ L].
Continue into the Couartyard.
Look around the area for 2
chests with a POTION [ポーション] and
ETHER [エーテル]. Now, move the
statues into their spots until
they click into place. Go
through the new exit.

You'll now be at Entrance Hall
2F. Go along around the area and
activate the switches along the
way to proceed. One of the
hallways has a chest with a HI-
POTION [ハイポーション]. Jump into the
hole at the center of the
balcony to drop down to the
first floor. Move forward a bit
for a scene then kill your
target, the Sergeant Heartless.
Once done, check the massive
door to unlock it. Make your way
back to the portal at the
bridge.

Mission 23 - Twilight Town

You will be starting out at the
Back Alley. Open the chest near
your portal for an ETHER [エーテル].
Take the east exit to the
Sandlot for a scene with Hayner.
Your next objective is to
investigate the Tunnel at the
Underground Concourse. But first
head to the Station Heights via
the north exit (from the
Sandlot). Grab a BLAZING SHARD
[燃え上がるかけら] from the chest there.

Next, head over to the Tram
Station and search the area for
3 treasures -- 2 MOONSTONES
[ムーンストーン] and a BLAZING SHARD
[燃え上がるかけら]. Return to the Back
Alley and take the northwest
exit into the Underground
Concourse. Make your way to the
south exit into the Tunnel.
There is a CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ]
treasure in the concourse too.

You'll meet Pence in the Tunnel.
After the dialogue, head to the
Sandlot for the next scene. Now,
go to the Usual Spot (west exit
in Back Alley). There, check the
green drum for a scene. When you
regain control, return to the
Tunnel and talk to Pence one
more time.

He will ask 3 questions, which
you must answer correctly in
order to proceed: Question 1:
Option 3; Question 2: Option 2;
Question 3: Option 3. Now, head
to the Tram Station and take the
east exit into the Forest.

In this area, look for a tree
that has leaves falling from it.
Attack the tree to trigger an
event, then proceed to the
Mansion Gates.

You have to defeat the Vanish
Lizard now. It has the ability
to make itself invisible from
time to time. Move around as
much as you can at this point to
avoid being caught by its tongue
or its laser beam. The creature
usually reappears after it fires
the laser. Try to stay away from
its tail, since it can blind you
when swiped.

while in midair. Talk to Xion to
get a CURE ALL [オールキュア]. Talk to
Saix for the next set of
missions. As always, I'll be
covering them in order from
24-28.

Mission 24 - Agrabah

You will start from the Palace
Gates. Grab the POTION [ポーション]
from the chest there; and
another POTION at the Baazar.
Continue on to the Palace Walls
and save Abu from the army of
Scarlet Tangos. Pick up an ETHER
[エーテル] from the treasure chest
afterwards. Head to the Cave of
Wonders through the secret
passage that Pete opened
earlier.

Inside, use the makeshift
staircase you built during your
very first visit to this cave,
to climb atop the north wall.
Examine the panel there and Xion
will put the gem in. Continue on
to the next screen. Here, open
the chest at the southeast
corner of the room for a POTION
[ポーション]. Next, head to the
northeast corner and hit the
switch there.

Use the moving platforms to
reach top of the northeast
pillar. Examine the block and
attack it. Now, head towards the
west exit via the platforms.
Grab another POTION from the
chest near the exit. Jump into
the pit in the next room. You'll
be at the upper level of the
first area. Find the block here
and attack it. Examine the "?"
areas here as well.

Now, make your way back to the
room above you (the one you just
jumped from). Once there, go to
the lower level and attack the
last block. A bridge will form
leading to the exit directly
ahead. Hit the cylinder switch
to open the gate. Quickly cross
the bridge to the exit.

You'll be in the Hidden Chamber
now. Grab another POTION and
check the statue. Defeat Pete
after dialogue. Mission
complete. Go home.

Mission 25 - Twilight Town

You'll be at the Tram Station in
Twilight Town. Your goal will be
to collect the emblems scattered
all over the area, to fill the
mission gauge. Grab them while
they're glowing to fill the
gauge faster. You can make the
emblems glow by defeating
enemies; grab an emblem to make
the others glow too. There are
two chests in the area with a
MOONSTONE [ムーンストーン] and a
BLAZING SHARD [燃え上がるかけら].

Mission 26 - Agrabah

There are 2 chests at the Palace
Gates containing POTIONS
[ポーション]; the ones at the Bazaar
has a POTION and an IRON [アイアン];
while the 2 at the Palace Walls
has another POTION and a HI
POTION [ハイポーション].

Your goal here is to destroy all
the Shadow Blocks (large purple
orbs) scattered all over every
accessible area. You won't be
able to see the targets from the
ground, so find a high spot and
survey the area. Use magic to
hit the ones that are too far
away.

Mission 27 - Beast's Castle

This mission requires you to
investigate. You start out at
Entrance Hall 2F. Grab a FROST
SHARD [凍てつくかけら] at the end of
long the hallway going west
Below is a list of suspicious
spots in the area.

* One of the crates at long
  hallway going west.
* The stained glass at the
  center of the rounded hallway.

Jump through the hole in the
wall down to 1st floor of
Entrance Hall. Grab the ETHER
[エーテル] here and start checking
for clues.

* Check the locked door to the
  right of the area.
* The claw marks at southwest
  wall.

Continue out to the Courtyard
afterwards. Pick up the POTION
[ポーション] and HI POTION [ハイポーション].
There are a couple of clues to
find.

* Check the northwest statue.
* The foot prints next to the
  northeast statue.

Head to the Entrance Hall and go
upstairs to the West Hall. Here,
you must avoid being spotted by
the candle, so try to stay clear
of the red zone. There's a chest
next to the staircase leading to
the West Wing. Make your way to
the northeast exit. Check the
mop and bucket along the way to
the northeast exit.

In the next room, kill all the
Heartless and grab the FROST
SHARD [凍てつくかけら]. Time to look
for the last 2 clues. Check the
footprints and the open door at
the end of the hall for a scene.
When prompted for a response,
pick either one of the two
options for both. Mission clear.

Before you go home, head to
Entrance Hall (1F) and check all
4 locked doors at the sides.
This will max out the mission
gauge.

Mission 28 - Beast's Castle

Explore all accessible areas and
kill all the Heartless that you
see until you max out the
mission gauge. Pick up a POTION
[ポーション] and FROST SHARD
[凍てつくかけら] at the Courtyard.

Entrance Hall.

candle and dash for the exit
across the hall. The candle will
be turning much faster this time
so be careful. Try to sneak over
to the southeast portion of the
hall to find 2 more treasure
chests containing COMBO ARTS
[コンボアーツ] and BRAVE GEAR [ブレイブギア]

In the dungeon, open both chests
for 2 POTIONS [ポーション]. Climb to

Heartless in each accessible
area. Some of them don't appear
right away, so you may have run
around for a bit until they
appear. There are 2 chests with
a POTION [ポーション] and HI POTION
[ハイポーション] at the Palace Walls; a
POTION [ポーション] and ETHER [エーテル]
at the Bazaar; another POTION

Mission 31 - Beast's Castle

You'll be at Beast's Castle
again. And Roxas, being the
gentleman that he is gives his
keyblade to Xion, and grabs a
stick to replace his weapon.
Don't worry, you can still
damage enemies with the stick,
though it is weaker and has far
shorter range than the keyblade.

Anyway, start by heading east
for an ETHER [エーテル] and continue
out to the West Hall; pick up
the FROST SHARD [凍てつくかけら] here.
Head to the Entrance Hall. Avoid
being seen by the clock and grab
2 ETHERS [エーテル] from the chests.
Kill both Sergeants and enter
the central door up the stairs
to the Ballroom. You'll find 3
ETHERS [エーテル] in this room.

Kill the Heartless to finish the
mission. Your stick is really
weak so you might want to
consider going for magics here.
A high level Fire spell is
really effective. The creature's
bite can inflict Silence though.

Shining Light Shard. Go ahead
and give him one. Now, collect
all 7 treasures in mission 29,
and speak to Axel. He tells you
go talk to Saix. Do so to unlock
a new mission (mission 35).

Mission 32 - Agrabah

Collect the POTION [ポーション] at
the Palace Gates; a BLIZZARD
RECIPE [ブリザドレシピ] at the Bazaar,
and another POTION [ポーション] at
the Palace Walls. From the
Palace Walls, head out to the
Ruins. There, ignore the Antlion
for a bit and search the area
for 3 treasure chests containing
POTION, HI POTION [ハイポーション] and
IRON [アイアン].

For the Antlion, chase it down
and attack it while it moves
around in the sand. It
occasionally pops out to fire
sand in your direction. Go
around the projectile and
continue attacking. Keep doing
this until you get the boss' HP
down to 2 1/2 bars. The Antlion
will be flying at this point and
be protected by Aero at the same
time.

Lock on to the target and run as
far from it as you can, to avoid
being hit by the blocks that it
throws. Now, move in and hit the
blocks back at the Antlion. This
will penetrate the barrier. It
takes about 4 hits from the
blocks to knock the boss out,
after which you get some free
hits before the target wakes up.
Keep repeating the process until
it dies.

The boss also fires a massive
laser beam that can be tough to
avoid. The best way to deal with
this is to take cover behind the
largest ruined structure you can
find, when you see the Antlion
prepare to fire.

Mission 33 - The World That
Never Was

Destroy all the pots/jars in the
room to clear this mission. One
of the jars contains a HI POTION
[ハイポーション] and another a POTION
[ポーション]. About 5 jars contain
Samurai nobodies. They can be
tough to kill once several of
them begin to gang up on you.

So either take them on one at a
time (avoid releasing others
when your current target is not
dead), or lure them away from
the jars then run back and
finish what you came here to do.

Mission 34 - Agrabah

Back to Agrabah again. The
chests at the Palace Gates and
Bazaar both contain POTIONS
[ポーション]. You can als grab a
BACKPACK [バックパック] from one of
the chests at Bazaar. The chests
in the Palace Walls has an IRON
[アイアン] and a POTION [ポーション].
Your goal for this mission is to
eliminate 4 Aerial Masters.

There is 1 at the Palace Walls
and 3 at the Ruins. The 4
treasure chests at the Ruins
contain 2 POTIONS [ポーション]
SHINING LIGHT SHARD [光かがやくかけら],
and an ETHER [エーテル].

Mission 35 - Beast's Castle

Off to Beast's Castle now. Kill
Heartless to fill the mission
gauge. Take note that Shadows
don't count. The West Hall has 2
treasure chests with BLIZZARD
RECIPE [ブリザドレシピ] and POTION
[ポーション]; the ones in the Dungeon
has POTION [ポーション] and a SLOT
UNLOCK [スロット開放]; and finally the
lone chest at the West Wing has
a HI POTION [ハイポーション].

Feel free to pick up whatever
else you may need, since you
should have accumulated plenty
of Heart Points by now.

Mission 36 - Olympus Coliseum

This is your first visit to
Olympus Coliseum. Starting from
the Coliseum Gates, defeat all
the Heartless dealing with the
trumpets first then take out the
Aiming Cannons. Grab a THUNDER
SHARD [とどろくかけら] from the chest
there. Below is a list of clues
for this area.

* The large board and all 3
  posters on the walls.
* One of the gaps on the
  southwest wall.
* The massive statues next to
  the lobby entrance.
* The closed door at the bottom
  of the area.

Proceed to the Lobby now. There
is a GEAR PARTS VER.1 [ギアパーツ

here. The things to check in
this room are:

* All the trophies on both sides
  of the area. When prompted for
  a response, pick the 1st
  option twice.

Once you've checked everything,
talk to Phil to start your
training. All you have to do is
smash the barrels and pick up
the orbs that appear for points.
Perform continuous chain attacks
to maximize the amount of orbs
from each barrel. Try to score
100 or more points here to claim
a small reward a little later in
the game. Mission clear.

There are some more stuff to
check to max out the mission
gauge.

* Both gold trophies in the
  lobby.
* The large statue to the right
  of the lobby entrance at the
  gates.

the ground. Try to score at
least 50 or higher, for a minor

This will be another
investigation quest. Starting
from the Entrance Hall, grab an
AIR UP [エアアップ] and a HI POTION
[ハイポーション].

* Check one of the doors to the
  east and west sides of the
  area.
* Examine one of the pillars in
  this room.

Moving on to the Courtyard, pick

and ETHER [エーテル]. Time to check
some things now.

be prompted for a response when
you check the door. Pick 1st
option for a scene.

Back to previous area and up to
West Hall. Avoid being seen by
the candle, then start checking
some more stuff.

* The mop and bucket next to the
  staircase.
* The floor atop the staircase.

Continue into the West Wing and
pick up the HI POTION [ハイポーション].
Check the room at the end of the

  the fallen painting near it.
* The broken statue and the
  gargoyle further down the
  hall.
* Check Belle's room at East
  Wing and pick 1st option
  during prompt.

Mission 39 - Olympus Coliseum

Once again, defeat all the
Heartless at the Coliseum Gates,
and Phil will appear asking you
to deal with the Heartless in
the Arena. This creature is very
similar to a Large Body. but it
has lots of HP and has a really
nasty spin attack after getting
up from a knock down.

Lock on to it and attack the
head, which can be tough to hit
since its real tiny compared to
the body. The best time to
strike is after the creature
executes a move.

There's a THUNDER SHARD
[とどろくかけら] treasure at the Lobby,
along with a TECH GEAR +
[テックギア+] and AERO RECIPE
[エアロレシピ] at the Coliseum Gates.
Talk to Phil at the Lobby to
start your training.

This one is pretty much the same
as the previous training
session. Perform continuous
chain attacks on the barrels to
maximize the orbs. Kill as many
Soldier Heartless as you can to
fill the mission gauge. Try to
score 130 points or higher for a
minor reward later on in the
game.

Mission 40 - Olympus Coliseum

Collect 2 AERO RECIPES [エアロレシピ]
and a CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ] from
the treasure chests then proceed
to the Arena and kill all the
Deserters. The Soldiers drop
Guard Arts, so be sure to kill
them too. Use the barrels to
defeat the targets instantly
when you can.

Mission 41  - Olympus Coliseum

There is a THUNDER RECIPE
[サンダーレシピ] treasure at the
Coliseum Gates; The chests at
the Arena contain another
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ] and
GEAR PARTS v1 [ギアパーツ ver.1].

Hopefully you have a Fire Charm
and an Ability Unit equipped
before coming here. You can't
damage the Morning Star while
spinning, so wait for it to stop
then attack. Use the barrels to
score instant kills on the
Aiming Cannons. They drop Gear
Parts v1, so do take them out.

for the Ballroom next and

there. Turn back and head for
the West Hall.

Take note that the Mega Shadows
drop Combo Arts, so try to kill
as many as you can to stock the
item for synthesis. Kill the
Dark Follower.

This creature is a purple
Darkside; the moves are the same
too. Attack whichever part you
can hit. The white heat seeking
orbs can blind you, while the
dark ones makes you weigh a ton
and keep you from jumping.

Avalanche to fill the mission
gauge. As stated before, you
have to kill enemies to make the
emblems glow, then collect them.
This fills the gauge faster.

There is a HI POTION [ハイポーション]
treasure at the Back Alley and a
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ] at the
Tunnel. Avalanche is waiting at
the Sandlot. This boss is very
weak to fire, so cast Fira as
much as you can to end the
battle quickly.

mission, score 50 or more points
in mission 37 and talk to Luxord
twice to unlock a new mission
(#49).

Mission 45 - Halloween Town

Check behind your portal for a
chest with a PHANTOM GEAR
[ファントムギア]. Continue on to the
Guillotine Square. There, search
the area for 2 chests with a HI
POTION [ハイポーション] and GALE SHARD
[吹きすさぶかけら]. Head to the
Graveyard for another GALE SHARD
[吹きすさぶかけら].

You'll be playing a minigame in
the Graveyard. Pick up a bone
and feed it to Zero; he will
then lead you to the Heartless'
hiding spot. Press A when the
green target marker appears and
the enemies will pop out. Keep
doing this until you max out the
mission gauge.

Mission 46 - Olympus Coliseum

Collect the CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ]
and BRONZE [ブロンズ] at the
Coliseum Gates, and the THUNDER
SHARD [とどろくかけら] at the Lobby.
Talk to Phil to start your
training. Kill as many Heartless
as you can here to fill the
mission gauge. Use the barrels
to score instant kills.

Mission 47 - Wonderland

This will be your very first
visit to Wonderland. When you
regain control after the scenes,
check behind your portal for an
IRON [アイアン]. Proceed to the
Bizzare Room now. There are 2
chests here containing a
BLIZZARD RECIPE [ブリザドレシピ] and
SLOT UNLOCK [スロット開放].

Kill all the Heartless and a
Vanish Lizard will appear.
You've fought this creature
before, so you pretty much know
what to do. If you get caught by
the tongue, quickly tap A to
escape.

Mission 48 - Agrabah

There are BLIZZARD RECIPE
[ブリザドレシピ] and Aero Recipe
[エアロレシピ] treasures at the Palace
Walls; another BLIZZARD RECIPE
and FIRE RECIPE [ファイアレシピ] at the
entrance to the Cave of Wonders.
Enter the cave.

Grab one more BLIZZARD RECIPE
[ブリザドレシピ] inside. Kill the Large
Body and the Solid Armor. The
latter Heartless is your main
target. Dealing with these
things should be easier, now
that you have the High Jump
ability. Mission accomplished;
go on home.

Mission 49 - Beast's Castle

There are plenty of treasures to
collect here: Entrance Hall:
POTION [ポーション]; Ballroom: HI
POTION [ハイポーション]; East Wing:
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ];
Dungeon: GEAR PARTS v1 [ギアパーツ
ver.1], POTION [ポーション]. West
Hall: ELIXIR RECIPE [エリクサーレシピ].
West Wing: BRONZE [ブロンズ].
Bridge: CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ].

Kill all the Heartless you can
find to fill the mission gauge.
Max it out when you can then
return home.

Pick up a HI POTION [ハイポーション]

Ballroom, then a BRONZE [ブロンズ]
and an ETHER [エーテル] at the
Entrance Hall. Head out to the
Couartyard for a brief scene and
continue to the bridge to face
your "unknown" target, the
Demon's Fortress.

I'd recommend stocking up on
high level magic spells before
coming here. Start throwing
spells when the bottom half of
the tank opens. It can pull out
several types of weapons from
its bottom half -- a Cannon: you
may attack from the side, just
dont stand in front of the
barrel. Hammer: I suggest
throwing spells from a distance.
Rolling balls of explosives: Run
far away and move away from its
path.

When the laser cannon appears,
move in and hit it with all you
got. This is the softest target
so you can inflict the largest
amount of damage on it. But
don't get too carried away,
since the whole tank will charge
forward when the cannon is done
storing energy.

Avoid the projectiles being
thrown by the Heartless above
the tank. You can also attack
the cover but your attacks will
be weaker. You can also use
Reflect Guard to deflect the
shots from the cannon and kill
off the Heartless on top of the
tank.

[オートロックオン]. A Knight Defense
[ナイトディフェンス] is a great ring
upgarade, so go on and buy that
as well.

Mission 51 - Wonderland

Your goal for this mission is to
find all 5 Pink Concerto
Heartless.

Pick up a SHINING LIGHT GEM
[光かがやく魔石] from the chest behind
your portal then continue to the
Bizzare Room and drink the
potion. Grab another SHINING
LIGHT GEM [光かがやく魔石] and an AERO
RECIPE [エアロレシピ] from both
treasure chests in this room.
Exit out to the garden
afterwards.

Jump onto one of the walls here
to find a HI POTION [ハイポーション].
Proceed further into the Queen's
Castle and take the south exit
to Lotus Forest. The Cheshire
Cat will appear and give a bit
of hint as to where you can find
your target. Examine the large
flowers in the forest (2 yellow,
1 blue, 1 red), and a Pink
Concerto will appear for each.

Hop along the upper levels of
this area for a couple of
treasure chests containing a
CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ] and DARK
INGOT [ダークインゴット].

Head back to the Queen's Castle
and attack the weight next to
the throne until it reaches the
bottom, to reveal the last Pink
Concerto.

a Chrono Gear (weapon) since
you're required to make
something out of the following
items: Gear Parts ver.1, Rune
Arts, and Bronze. Once done,
speak to Luxord and he'll give
you a SHINING LIGHT GEM
[光かがやく魔石]. Talk to Saix for new
quests.

Mission 52 - Halloween Town

Open the chest at the starting
point for a THUNDER RECIPE
[サンダーレシピ]. Get a GALE SHARD
[吹きすさぶかけら] and FROST GEM
[凍てつく魔石] at the Guillotine
Square. Continue on to the
Graveyard and grab the BLAZING
GEM [燃え上がる魔石] and BLIZZARA
RECIPE [ブリザラレシピ]. Now, hit the
explosive pumpkins towards the
unlit lanterns to light them.
Once both are lit, the coffin
opens an exit to a new area.

Here, open the treasure chest
for a GALE GEM [吹きすさぶ魔石], then
light all the lanterns to open
the next exit. Take that one to
the Curly Hill. Search the area
for a BLAZING GEM [燃え上がる魔石] and
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ]. Defeat
Lock, Shock, and Barrel which
should be quite easy since all 3
of them have fairly little HP.

Most of the balloons contain
Heartless, so pop those and kill
whatever appears to fill the
mission gauge. Zero will be here
too; pick up the bones and feed
him. He'll lead you to the
Heartless' hiding spots. Keep
doing this unil you max out the
mission gauge.

Mission 53 - Neverland

Your mission is to search for
Wave Crest on the small island.
After the scene with Smee and
Captain Hook, defeat all the
Heartless that appear then move
forward for the next scene.
You'll eventually gain the
ability to glide (press B to
descend and Y to ascend).

Notice that some parts of the
island have holes on them. What
you need to do is hop into these
holes and check the stuff at the
bottom. Some enemies will appear
once you do. Kill them and grab
an item from the hole.

Wave Crest appears when you
examine the hole on the tall
stone "island" to the east on
the water. This creature is an
upgarded version of the Tail
Bunker that you fought back in
Twilight Town early in the game.
Cast Fira spells when possible,
then fly above the target and
attack from there. If you have a
limit available, then by all
means, use it.

Mission 54 - Halloween Town

Grab the GALE SHARD [吹きすさぶかけら]
from the chest at the starting
point. Dual Blade awaits you at
the Guillotine Square, but
before you fight him, search the
area for a chest containing a
RECOVERY UP [リカバリーアップ].

The Dual Blade is an upgraded
and larger version of the
Rolling Soldier. Hit it with
combos until you see it charge
up. Move away at this point
since the creature will use both
of its blade next. When it
jumps, it'll create a large
shockwave on landing. Avoid
getting caught by this since it
can take away a huge chunk of
your HP.

Mission 55 - Wonderland

Your goal for this mission is to
collect the emblems (displayed
on the bottom screen). Defeat
enemies or collect other emblems
to make the targets glow before
you grab them. This fills the
mission gauge faster.

Check behind your portal for a
chest with GEAR PARTS v2 [ギアパーツ
ver.2]. Continue to the Bizzare
Room and pick up a FIRE RECIPE
[ファイアレシピ] and a CURA RECIPE
[ケアルラレシピ]. The chests o the
upper sections of Lotus Forest
has a CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ]. Head
to the Tea Party Garden next for
a RECOVERY UP L [リカバリーアップ L].

Your objective is to search for
and kill both Heat Saber and
Destroyer, but go hunt some
treasures first before you go.
The chest at the Back Alley
contains a GEAR PARTS v2 [ギアパーツ
ver.2]; the one at the Station
Heights has a THUNDER RECIPE
[サンダーレシピ]. There are two more
chests at the Station Plaza with
another THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ]
and a SLOT UNLOCK [スロット開放].

The Heat Saber awaits at the
Sandlot. Deal with the Barrier
Master first; knock the book
away and spam the "user" with
magic. As for the main target,
cast Blizzara and if you have
limit breaks available then use
it. Try to avoid its dive attack
as much as you can, as this
deals massive damage. Head to
the Station Plaza afterwards.

For the Destroyer, its body will
always be open to attack, but
the arms constantly fire laser
beams, which have great
firepower. Stay away from the
laser's path at all costs; try
to stay between the arms.

Head to the Bizarre Room and
claim the SHINING LIGHT GEM
[光かがやく魔石] and DARK INGOT
[ダークインゴット] from both chests.
Grab the HI POTION [ハイポーション] at
the next screen, and continue
further into the Queen's Castle.
Pick up another SHINING LIGHT
GEM [光かがやく魔石] and DARK INGOT
[ダークインゴット] here. Go back to the
previous area and enter the
maze.

You need to sneak past the
guards here as you search the
area for a trio of Commander
Heartless. There are also 2
chests with one more DARK INGOT
[ダークインゴット] and an AERO RECIPE
[エアロレシピ]. Defeat the 3
Commanders to finish the
mission.

Mission 58 - Neverland

Your objective is to locate and
defeat a total of 3 Flying Arts.
What you must do is the same as
what you did during your first
visit. Hop into the holes and
examine the stuff inside. Kill
the Heartless that appear. Claim
the item in the hole afterwards.
Keep doing this until you
eliminate all 3 Flying Arts.
Hook's ship will fire its
cannons from time to time. That
deals massive damage so try to
avoid being hit as much as
possible.

Mission 59 - Twilight Town

You must collect 3 Shining Light
Shards to complete this quest.
There is a THUNDER RECIPE
[サンダーレシピ]; the one at the
Station Heights contains a GEAR
PARTS v2 [ギアパーツ ver.2]. Head to
the Tram Station and search for
Guardian enemies; they are the
only ones that drop the item you
want.

Mission 60 - Neverland

Hunt down Avalanche and cast
Fira on it. Hopefully it ends up
getting burned. That will make
things easier. The best time to
attack is after the creature
executes a move. Limit Breaks
are still the best way to go.
There are 2 chests with FROST
SHARDS [凍てつくかけら] in this area
too.

and a THUNDER SHARD [とどろくかけら]
from the chests at the Coliseum

[スロット開放]. Talk to Phil to start

Win 4 rounds of battle at the

targets instantly. You get to
fight Xaldin after that. Just
get him down to half HP, and
Guard Armor appears after a
brief dialogue.

Cast Thunder or jump to hit its
head, until it separates into 3
parts. When that happens, take
out the arms first, then the
feet. Keep repeating the process
until both the arms and legs are
gone. The body should be quite
easy to destroy once alone, so
finish it off quickly.

Axel to unlock a new mission
(#63). Next, collect all the
treasures in mission 51, then
speak to Demyx for another new
quest (#64).

Mission 62 - Halloween Town

Head to the Guillotine Square
and pick up a BLIZZARA RECIPE
[ブリザラレシピ] and a BLIZZARD RECIPE
[ブリザドレシピ] from both treasure
chests. Proceed to the Graveyard
for a BLAZE GEM [燃え上がる魔石]. Off
to the next screen for another
BLIZZARD RECIPE [ブリザドレシピ]. Kill
the army of Ghosts here and move
on to a new area.

At the Moonlight Hill, pick up a
couple of SILVERS [シルバー], then
hit the pumpkin bombs towards
the unlit lanterns, to light
them and open a new exit. Grab
the GALE GEM [吹きすさぶ魔石] and
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ] here.
Now, examine the lone baloon to
find your target.

The Ghost will mostly stay high
above you, so jump and hit it
with a long string of air
combos. It is also quite
vulnerable to fire, especially
when it gets burned. The
creature will constantly attempt
to grab you as well, which saps
your health rapidly if it
succeeds.

After beating the ghost, head
back to your portal and kill the
???? that appears. It drops a
Gear Parts v3. Mission complete.

There are also hidden Heartless
in some areas, which you must
find in order to unlock a
mission later in the game. The
locations are:

* Check one of the pair of
  orange jack-o'-lanterns on the
  wall of the Guillotine Square.
  The one to the left is what
  you want.
* The lamp next to the door
  leading to Finkelstein's lab.
* Head to Curly Hill, climb atop
  the hill, and check the tip.
* One of the grave stones at the
  northeast corner of the Curly
  Hill.

Mission 63 - Wonderland

Your goal here is to destroy all
the Shadow Blocks scattered all
over Wonderland. Collect a
DIAMOND [ダイヤモンド] and AERO RECIPE
[エアロレシピ] at the Bizarre Room;
then another set of DIAMOND
[ダイヤモンド] and AERO RECIPE
[エアロレシピ] at the Maze Entrance;
you get a CURE RECIPE [ケアルレシピ]
and a HI POTION [ハイポーション] at the
Lotus Forest, and finally, there
is a GALE CRYSTAL [吹きすさぶ結晶] at
the Tea Party Garden.

Mission 64 - Neverland

The target, Emerald Serenade,
does nothing other than fly
around in circles. But the
problem is it's very difficult
to hit especially if you're not
used to the controls when
flying. Hope that Axel manages
to hit it with a Fire spell and
burn it. If you're going to
attack, do it from a very close
range. Or find out the path the
creature usually uses, then wait
there, and attack it when it
passes by.

The treasures here are GEAR
PARTS v3 [ギアパーツ ver.3] and an
AERO RECIPE [エアロレシピ]. Check each
"island" to find the chests.

Mission 65 - Wonderland

Make your way to the Maze

the Queen's Castle for a scene
then return to the previous
screen and into the maze. What
you must do is find the 4
switches to activate the lamps
in the Bizarre Room.

Once again, you need to sneak
past the guards. Start by going
west to find the first switch,
but before that, there is a
chest with a CURA RECIPE
[ケアルラレシピ] near the entrance.
After activating the first
switch, proceed through the west
exit to the next screen.

There, head to the southeast
corner for a DIAMOND [ダイヤモンド].
From there, head left and up to
the second switch; to the
northwest of that is another
CURA RECIPE [ケアルラレシピ]. From the
second switch, go east, north,
then east to the third switch.
All guards will leave
afterwards. Head east from the
third switch for a HI POTION
[ハイポーション]. Take the northeast
exit back to the previous area.

The fourth and last switch is
just to the east then north of
the first one. You were not able
to activate this earlier due to
a guard blocking it. There is
another treasure chest to the
northwest of the 4th switch.
Head to the northeast corner of
the area for a DIAMOND [ダイヤモンド].

With all the lamps now on, head
back to the Bizarre Room to meet
your target, the Next Shadow.
Kill it to clear this mission.

Mission 66 - Halloween Town

Take a look behind your portal
to find a SILVER [シルバー].
Continue on to the Guillotine
Square, kill all the ????
enemies and search the area for
a GALE GEM [吹きすさぶ魔石]. Next stop
is the Graveyard; hop into the
coffin to the next screen. Grab
the THUNDAGA RECIPE [サンダガレシピ].
Proceed to the Moonlight Hill;
climb the ladder there to
another area.

Collect a SILVER [シルバー], BLAZING
CRYSTAL [燃え上がる結晶], FROST GEM
[凍てつく魔石], then take the exit
leading to the sewer. Grab a
PREMIUM ORB [プレミアムオーブ] from the
chest in this room. Defeat
Parasite Grave.

It's best to stay clear of the
grave for now, and focus on
taking out all the ????
surrounding the boss. Once
you've done that, the grave will
collapse and you can move in to
attack it. It will recover after
a while when the ???? are
revived. The ???? will
constantly try to swallow you
and have the grave spit you out.
This move does massive damage so
try to avoid getting eaten as
much as possible.

Make quick work of the ????s by
casting high level Thundara
spells. Use limit break + final
limit attacks when it becomes
available during the time when
the grave is out cold.

Mission 67 - Wonderland

Claim a couple of AERO RECIPES
[エアロレシピ] from the chests in the
Bizarre Room and Maze Entrance.
There's an AIR UP L [エアアップ L] at
the Maze Entrance as well. The
one at the Queen's Castle has an
AERORA RECIPE [エアロラレシピ]. Get a
HI POTION [ハイポション] and HI ETHER
[ハイエーテル] at Lotus Forest, plus
another HI POTION [ハイポション] at
the Tea Party Garden. The
target, Emerald Serenade is in
the Lotus Forest.

This round against the Serenade
will be somewhat easier. Don't
bother chasing after it.
Instead, just wait at a spot the
creature frequents and attack it
when it passes by.

Mission 68 - Agrabah

Collect a GLIDE UP L [グライドアップ L]
and a HI POTION [ハイポション] at the
cave entrance. There's another
HI POTION [ハイポション] and a HI
ETHER [ハイエーテル] at the Palace
Gates, and a BLIZZARD RECIPE
[ブリザドレシピ] at the Bazaar. The
first area in the cave also has
a BLIZZARD RECIPE.

Simply kill as many Heartless as
you can to fill the mission
gauge and finish this quest.

RECIPE [サンダラレシピ]. Off to the
next screen and look on top of
the fireplace to find 2 treasure
chests with a HI POTION [ハイポション]
and a HI ETHER [ハイエーテル]. Time to
deal with the Breed Performer.

There are two of these things
here, and each of them must die
shortly after the other.
Otherwise, the dead one will be
revived with full HP. So attack
both targets until each of them
has a tiny chunk of health left
then you can finish them off. It
will be a good idea to equip
something that boosts your
resistance to fire as well.

Mission 70 - Beast's Castle

Grab the SLOT UNLOCK [スロット開放] at
the Ballroom then head out to
the Entrance Hall, and kill all
the Deserters to finish this
mission. There is an Invincible
enemy waiting by your portal.
Defeat it if you want.

Mission 71 - The World That
Never Was

All you need to do here is
survive for 2 minutes against
Dusk and Samurai Nobodies. Cast
Thundara or Thundaga as a form
of shield if the enemies begin
to gather around you.

Mission 72 - Halloween Town

The treasure chest behind your
portal has a THUNDER RECIPE
[サンダーレシピ] Defeat as many
Heartless as you can at the

You must regain the ability to

else. Take the nearby exit to
the pirate ship. There, head to
the Captain's Quarters for a
scene, then enter the room after
Hook and Smee leave.

After saving Tinkerbell, get off
the ship and return to the
previous screen. There, fly to
the island marked with a red
star on the map. Land and hit
the surface with you keyblade to
start digging. Some events
follow. Now, head to where Smee
and Hook are for the next event.
The target, Tail Mirage appears
and the digging duo will run
off.

Try to hit the creature from
behind on any body part you can
reach, as long as the boss is
facing away from you. It simply
teleports when you attack it
head on, so it's pointless to
try and hit it from that angle.

Mission 78 - Neverland

Once again, approach the digging
Smee and Hook; watch their
treasure hunt be interrupted by
yet another Heartless -- the Sky
Ruler.

I strongly recommend equipping a
ring that boosts your resistance
to Ice (a Blizzard Charm works
perfectly). This boss will fly
around the area, shooting ice
orbs from its tail, and produce
ice pillars from the water. The
tail is the only part that you
can lock on to, so follow the
creature and attack the tail
when you get close enough.
Getting magic spells to find
their mark is difficult, so just
stick to normal attacks.

Avoid the orbs and pillars and
keep attacking until one section
of the tail falls off. Once,
this happens, the boss gets mad
and try to slam into you several
times. Stay under wing level to
avoid the attack. Rinse and
repeat until the whole tail is
decimated.

At this point, it will be
shooting projectiles for a
while, then stop to use its
rapid fire attack. Fly under the
creature towards its middle and
attack the heart. The Sky Ruler
will eventually stop shooting
and stay in one spot to cool
off. Take this chance to land a
series of combos, then fly away
before the target can swipe you
with its claws.

Mission 79 - Halloween Town

Proceed to the Guillotine
Square, clear the area of
Heartless, and search for a
treasure chest containing a HI
ETHER [ハイエーテル]. Off to the
Graveyard then hop into the
coffin to the next screen. Pick
up a THUNDER CRYSTAL [とどろく結晶]
here. Now, go on to the Curly
Hill and defeat some more
Heartless. Take the east exit
first afterwards.

Grab the HI ETHER [ハイエーテル] in
this area then return to the
previous screen, climbing up the
ladder to the west. Pick up the
THUNDER RECIPE [サンダーレシピ]. Defeat
all the minor Heartless and your
real target, the Gold Reaper
appears. It's just another
variation of the Rolling
Soldier, and is weak to Fire.
Cast Firaga and hope that it
gets burned.

Mission 80 - Beast's Castle

Your goal in this mission is
simple: Smash at least 15 pots
to fill the mission gauge to its
desired point. Of course you can
break the remaining ones to max
out the gauge if you like. Some
of the pots contain Living Pod
enemies, which will definitely
kill Roxas if they grab him, so
watch out. There are also Hi
Potions in some of the pots.

Mission 81 - Wonderland

Your target here is the Emerald
Serenade, which is an enemy that
I learned to dislike not long
after our first meeting. It will
be moving around the maze
constantly, so you might want to
wait at a spot where you can
land the most hits on the
creature when it passes by.

There are 6 treasure chests in
this mission as well. The 3 at
the first area contain: DIAMOND
[ダイヤモンド], GALE CRYSTAL
[吹きすさぶ結晶], BLIZZAGA RECIPE
[ブリザガレシピ]. The 3 in the 2nd are
has 2 DIAMONDS and a SLOT UNLOCK

Mission 82 - Agrabah

Before heading into the Cave of
Wonders, check the other areas
for loots first -- Palace Gates:
GOLD [ゴールド]; Bazaar: Sense Unit
L [センスユニット L]; Palace Walls: HI
POTION [ハイエーテル]; Ruins: HI ETHER
[ハイエーテル]. Head into the cave
once you have everything.

There, pick up another GOLD
[ゴールド] then go through the east
exit to the Secret Basement. Hop
onto higher ground to find an
AERORA RECIPE [エアロラレシピ]. Attack
the huge gold statue and 4
crates will drop from above.
Push these crates onto the 3
switches on the lower area. This
opens a new exit. Take that one
to the lamp room.

Grab one more GOLD [ゴールド] and an
ADAMANTITE [アダマンタイト] from the 2
chests, then approach the locked
door up ahead for some scenes.
The Spike Roller will appear.
Just watch it spin for a while
until an event occurs. Mission
complete, you can go home now.

CRYSTAL [燃え上がる結晶]; Bridge: HI
ETHER [ハイエーテル]. The Entrance
Hall 2F, Dungeon, West Wing, and
East Wing all have an ELIXIR
[エリクサー] each. Continue with the
mission once you have
everything.

Head to the Ballroom first for a
scene with Belle, then take a
peek into Beast's room in the
West Wing for the next event.
Off to the East Wing next and
finally, head back to your
portal to find Xaldin there.

Mission 84 - Olympus Coliseum

Pick up a FIRAGA RECIPE
[ファイガレシピ] at the Coliseum Gates,
and go all the way into the
Arena to fight the Burning Ball.
This is just a modified Morning
Star. Wait for it to stop
spinning then attack or cast
high level ice magic. You can
also use the barrels to stop it
from spinning.

Mission 85 - Wonderland

Look behind your portal to find
a SLOT UNLOCK [スロット開放], then go
claim a FIRA RECIPE [ファイラレシピ] at
the Bizarre Room. Next, the maze
entrance has a GALE CRYSTAL
[吹きすさぶ結晶] and HI POTION
[ハイポーション].

Simply kill as many Heartless as
you can to fill the mission
gauge. This can take quite a
while, so it's alright to not
max out the gauge.

Mission 86 - Neverland

This is another one of those
"collect emblems" to fill the
gauge mission. You should know
the drill here, when the glow
fades, grab an emblem to make
the rest glow again. There's a
FIRE RECIPE [ファイアレシピ] here too.

Mission 87 - Halloween Town

Head to the Guillotine Square
and claim 2 THUNDAGA RECIPES
[サンダガレシピ] then dash for the
Graveyard to get the THUNDER
CRYSTAL [とどろく結晶]. Go back to the
previous area and kill all 3
Windstorms to complete quest.

The best way to deal with these
things when they gather together
in one place is to just unleash
limit breaks with final limits
to damage all 3 of them at once,
Keep doing this until your limit
gauge dries up.

Mission 88 - Halloween Town

Take a look behind your portal
for a chest with SLOT UNLOCK

Chip off a few bars from its
health and an event plays.
Mission complete.

PARTS v4 [ギアパーツ ver.4]; Tram
Station: HI ETHER, GEAR PARTS
v4, POTION; Underground
Concourse: HI ETHER. Your goal
is to locate and defeat 6 major
Heartless. That should be enough
to clear this quest.

The locations of the 6 targets
are as follows: #1: Sandlot. #2:
Tram Station. #3: Underground
Concourse. #4: Tunnel. #5:
Station Plaza. #6: Old Mansion.
#7: Station Plaza.

For the 7th Heartless, Debris
Flow, equip a ring that raises
your fire resistance like Fire
Charm. That should reduce damage
from its fireball attack. Glide
to avoid the fireballs. The
massive shockwave can be avoided
by gliding. Also, never ever
land in the center of the
shockwave blast, since that
deals massive, and I mean
massive damage to Roxas.

Again, it is not required of you
to kill the 7th Heartless. But
you will have to defeat it if
you want to unlock Sora in
Mission Mode.

Mission 91 - The World that
Never Was

This will be the last time
you'll be seeing this castle, so
make absolutely sure that you
have everything you need.
Otherwise, go visit the moogle.
Once you're ready, really ready,
save your game, talk to Axel and
pick the first option. A long
dialogue follows.

Its time to bid this place
goodbye. Start by taking the
east exit to the next room and
follow the path all the way to
an area with 2 treasure chests.
Grab the THUNDARA RECIPE
[サンダラレシピ] and AERORA RECIPE
[エアロラレシピ]. After that, go north,
taking the elevator down to
another floor. There, head south
and you'll run into Saix.

As expected, he refuses to just
let you by, so you'll have to
make him move by force. Saix
receives a great defensive boost
while glowing and he also dishes
out a series of rather nasty
combos in this state. Try to get
behind him by dodge rolling or
gliding then counter with your
own combos. You can also block
the attack with Reflect Guard
(hold Y on ground).

Eventually, the glow fades and
he will be incapacitated for
some time. Take this chance to
nail him with your best combos,
and if you have limit breaks
available then by all means use
it. Having the Reraise panel
equipped will save you in case
Roxas dies, but that will only
work once during battle.

Mission 92 - Twilight Town

When you regain control of
Roxas, head to the Station
Plaza. You can access the menu
screen at this point, so go
ahead and save your game.
Examine the glass doors and
choose the first option to
proceed. Prepare for a four-
round boss fight after some
cutscenes.

Round 1

Your opponent should be easy
enough on round 1, so try to
save the curative spells for
later encounters, unless of
course you have a lot. Just hack
her down and she will teleport
you both to a new battle zone.

Round 2

For round 2, most of her attacks
are still physical in nature.
Try to get behind her with Dodge
Roll or whatever else when she
does the 3-hit combo and counter
with your own from there. She
also uses Aero to pin you down
then performs a single cleaving
attack. Jumping is fairly
effective in avoiding this move.
The nastiest move in her list is
the heat seeking projectiles.
Glide away from her and stay out
of range until the missiles fade
away. She usually uses the move
3 times consecutively.

Round 3

The only effective method that I
found against this form is to
execute air combos then allow
her to damage you until your
limits become usable. Use limit
breaks and follow through with
final limits. She heals massive
amounts of health to herself
when her HP gets down to a
certain point. So take her out
before she gets a chance to use
it.

Round 4

She's grown really huge now and
most of her attacks are magic-
based. The Full Circle accessory
helps a whole lot in damage
reduction. Try to stay airborne
as much as you can, then glide
towards her and attack. If she
blows you off, just fly back and
continue attacking.

Mission 93 - The World that
Never Was

You get to control a dual-
weilding Roxas for the first
time here. You will appreciate
the great boost in Roxas' attack
power here. Sweep the area clean
of all Heartless and keep moving
forward until you reach the
battle zone. You'll be treated
to a very very familiar event
before the final showdown....
deep dive, anyone?

You can use Reflect Guard to
block your opponent's combos
then counter with your own. His
combos are not that strong, so
its alright to get caught by it,
just don't let it happen too
often.

--------------------------------
You'll be allowed to save your
game after the ending credits.
Though there is no new game
plus, you'll be allowed to play
through all the missions in the
game anytime when you load your
cleared game save.

You'll also be able to access
"Theater Mode" in the title
screen. This lets you view all
the movie sequences in the game.

You can only get a maximum of 3
trial symbols for each trial

mission over and over, after
receiving the full reward from
it once. You can then present
the symbols at the moogle shop
to get free items.

These missions are unlocked by
collecting one of the blue
badges in each story mission:
試練の証 unlocks the "normal" trial
missions, while the 試練皆伝の証
unlocks SP trial missions. The
red badge unlocks missions that
can be played in Mission Mode.
