Here's what I intend to do with
this guide (in short).
+ Provide basic game info
+ Provide information on drones
+ Provide information on enemies
+ Provide information on all
  Galaxies and Planets
+ Provide some strategies on
  levels, but hopefully get
  feedback from you (the reader)
  on really good strategies for
  levels.

Let us begin then...

*** This FAQ was written with
    the DS version of Geometries
    Wars: Galaxies, I find that
    the Wii version is MUCH more
    difficult! The higher
    quality graphics and more
    powerful processor allow for
    a lot more chaotic on screen
    action! So, let it be known.

__/ Controls \__________________
If you've played the Xbox Live
Arcade game Geometry Wars: Retro
Evolved you know about the
simple to use dual-joystick
controls, but obviously the DS
(nor the Wii, if you're playing
that version) have dual
joysticks, so there have been
some changes in the controls. I
think these make the game a
little more difficult to get
used to than the 360 version,
but despite the learning curve
they work fairly well.

*correction* - if you have the
 Classic Controller for the Wii
 you can
actually use it and then you
have that Dual Joystick style
control. Thanks to Kilroy84 for
pointing this out.

    o===========================

This is the default set up, the
controls can be swapped around
in options to change the stylus
to movement and to swap the
control pad and face buttons for
lefty's.

   ____________
__/ Game Modes \________________
The Games main mode is
"Galaxies" (as the name
implies), but it is not the only
mode. There are a few Multi-
Player modes along with the
original version of the game,
Retro Evolved.

~~~~ Galaxies ~~~~ In Galaxies
mode you will be traveling to
different Galaxies battling in
each ones various planets to
gain medals and collect Geoms.
Although the Medals don't really
have an effect on the game, each
planet has a Bronze, Silver and
Gold medal available for scoring
so many points.

Each enemy also drops Geoms in
this mode that can be used for
many things. I explain Geoms in
more depth down below, but
you'll be using these to unlock
new Drones, new Planets and new
Galaxies.

This is essentially the
"adventure" mode of Geometry
Wars: Galaxies (if you didn't
notice by the name).


~~~~ Multi-Player ~~~~
Unfortunately I don't know
anyone else who owns this game I
can play it with. Please feel
free to send me info to put here
about multiplayer modes.

Score! Got emails about multi-
player! Here's what I've learned
from them: First and foremost,
just to note, it's not online
multi-player. Local only. Just
to clear up any questions anyone
may have. On the plus side of
that, it is download and play
compatible apparently (which I
never even thought to try...)
and you get all the same
multiplayer things you would
give if both people had the
game.

Co-op: This mode allows two
people to play together in a
large square arena against the
normal horde of enemies. Lives
and bombs are shared between
both ships in this mode.

Simultaneous: In this mode both
players play in their own arena
and it's a game of who can last
the longest. When one player
destroys enemies they will be
given to the opponent to deal
with. Similar to the way
multiplayer Tetris works where
deleting rows gives them to your
opponents (if you've played
that).

Vs: In this mode one player is
the ship fighting off enemies
and the other player is sending
in the enemies. There are eight
enemies you can place down:
Wanderers, Grunts, Weavers,
Spinners, Gravity Wells,
Repulsors, Mayflies and Protons.

(copy and pasted straight from
email...)

You have a certain number you
can place that goes up the
longer the game goes on. I call
this number the "Pinwheel
Count", becasue first, the
wanderers look like pinwheels
and I tend to call the enemies
by their shapes, and second,
placing enemies detracts from
your overall count.

You can get up to a maximum of
100 Wanderers, and then 50
Grunts. However, each Grunt is
worth two Wanderers, so your
count of Wanderers will go down
by 2.

So I have a "pinwheel count" of
100. I place a Wanderer, and
then I have 99.

When my opponent destroys this
wanderer, I get it back in my
count, and I'll be at 100 again.

The trick, then, is to manage
your pinwheel count by using the
different enemy types as you
attempt to overwhelm your
opponent. Clearly, using simply
Wanderers will not be much
threat! So, mix it up by
throwing out some grunts, the
diamonds. They will actively
chase your opponent.

You can also see a miniature
version of your opponent's
screen on your bottom screen.
This is how you know where to
palce what. Know that he can't
see the entirety of his screen
like you can see it, so if you
know what the field of vision
is, you can pull tricks like
placing the repulsors (magnets)
in the corners of the screen so
he won't see them get ready to
attack.

You win if your enemies destroy
your opponent three times. He
wins if he scores 50,000 points.
There's a maximum of a 10x
multiplier, so do what you can
to make sure he doesn't reach
it, or he'll put a big dent in
the score he needs to win.

(end paste)

~~~~ Retro Evolved ~~~~ This is
what I would call the "classic"
mode. It is a reproduction of
the game that was released on
the Xbox Live Arcade. It
features one large square area
and a ton of enemies for you to
see how long you can last up
against.


   __________
__/ Gameplay \__________________

~~~~ Basic Info ~~~~ For those
new to the Geometry Wars games,
here's what it's all about.

You have full control of a ship
with a 360 degree shooting
angle. You can shoot in any
direction despite the direction
you are moving in. Most enemies
die in 1 hit as do you. Most
levels give you 3 lives before
you lose, but some only give you
one.

The game thrives off of the
arcade style logic of "how many
points can you get this time?"
There's no real end to any
level, it's all about endurance.

Galaxies twists up the formula
by pitting you in many different
sized and shaped rooms while
forcing you to fight off
hundreds and thousands of
different enemies.

Defeated enemies drop Geoms
which you can collect and are
good for all sorts of different
reasons. But I explain these
reasons below in the Geoms
section, so read there for more
info.

There's a bit more going on, but
I'll talk about everything
individually in the following
sections so just keep reading.

~~~~ Geoms ~~~~ Galaxies
introduces a form of "currency"
to Geometry Wars called Geoms.
As you defeat enemies they will
drop these Geoms that usually
either look like diamonds or
bold plus signs. They dissapear
after a short time of being on
screen and collecting them
allows you to buy new drones,
new planets and new galaxies.

Collecting Geoms also gives you
gun upgrades and extra
lives/bombs while in levels. Any
level that starts you with 1
life, you cannot gain bombs or
extra lives in (as far as I've
noticed). However, any level
that starts you wtih 3 live and
3 bombs at set increments of
Geoms you can gain +1 of each.

Yet another perk to Geoms is
your score mutliplier. Each
enemy has a base amount of
points it will give you for
defeating it. However, with each
Geom you collect your mutiplier
increases up to a max of 150x.
It will stay at this point as
long as you are alive, but once
you die you'll be back to 1x.

After you've bought all the
galaxies, planents and drones
collecting geoms really serves
no purpose except for the extra
lives/bombs in those levels.

I've been sent these numbers
that I want to share:
+ at 350 geoms is your first gun
  upgrade.
+ at 5000 geoms is an extra life
  (in applicable levels)
+ at 7500 geoms is an extra bomb
  (once again, where applicable)

~~~~ Lives ~~~~ Pretty
straightforward, each level has
a set number of lives you start
with. If you lose them all, the
level ends, as long as you have
one, you keep going.

You don't have health so running
into any enemy will cause you to
die and lose a life. You can get
more lives as mentioned above in
the Geoms section.

~~~~ Bombs ~~~~ Most levels give
you some bombs to start with.
Using a bomb clears the screen
of all enemies, but gives you no
points for those enemies. From
what I've noticed, bombs do not
clear Asteroids from the screen,
but will clear all other enemy
types.

Although it sounds like a waste
of precious points to use bombs
to kill off the enemies and get
no points, keep in mind that if
you have a 150x multiplier and
you die, you're going to lose a
lot more points building back up
that mutliplier than if you had
just bombed the screen to save
yourself. Bombs should be used
when you get caught in a corner
and can't get out.

~~~~ Gun ~~~~~
At the beginning of a stage your
gun fires out 2 shots. There are
no bullet amounts that you can
run out or anything, it's a
constant steady fire in whatever
direction you choose. After
collecting X number of Geoms (I
don't know the exact number) you
will upgrade to a higher level
gun. There are 2 higher level
guns that will randomly swap
between each other throughout
the rest of the stage.

One has 3 rapid fire shots, the
other has 5 slower shooting
shots. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages,
but it's not really worth
discussing since you don't have
control over which one you'll
have when. But you will never
downgrade back to the 2 shot gun
after upgrading to one of the
higher level ones, thats for
sure.

__/ Tips and Tricks \___________
I reference a few things over
and over again throughout this
FAQ so I figured why not just
move them all up to here in case
you are just looking for some
general info and not anything
level specific. So, here is what
I call "Tips and Tricks" and
please feel free to send me any
of your tips or general
strategies so that I can add
them here. After all, the more
the merrier.

~~~~ The Circle Method ~~~~ To
Geometry Wars veterans this is
like second nature, but to new
comers this can be a very
helpful strategy to get used to
and you'll see that I reference
it in probably half of the
planets.

The general thought behind this
strategy is that none of the
enemies are very smart and they
are all after you. So, if you
just continue to fly in big
clockwise or counter-clockwise
circles around the edges of the
level (but not to close to the
edges) then everything will
gather up behind you in one
giant cluster.

As you circle be sure to be
shooting straight ahead so that
you don't run into anything,
then when you have a little
breathing room, turn around
quickly and fire off some shots
in the mass to eliminate some of
those enemies. Master this and
you have mastered Retro Evolved
mode along with having a much
easier time in many of the
planets.

~~~~ Have Faith ~~~~ Another
thing that is hard for new
comers to Geometry Wars (and was
definitely hard for me) is to
have faith in your little ships
guns. If you fly straight into a
mass of pretty much any enemy,
no matter how many, as long as
you are shooting straight ahead
where you're flying you aren't
going to get hurt and you're
going to destroy everything.

I think it's easy to want to
stray away from the big clusters
of enemies because they can be
fairly intimidating, but try it
out a few times and just "have
faith".

~~~~ Watch the Edge ~~~~ Most
enemies will spawn around the
edges so try not to ever sit to
close to them. Enemies *will*
spawn on top of you and you will
die from it. Often with
Asteroids you'll get a second
chance because as long as your
shooting they seem to take their
first explode if they spawn on
top of you, but you won't be so
lucky with regular enemies. So
beware not to sit to close to
the walls.

~~~~ Stay out of Corners ~~~~
Okay, initially I chose to take
a stand that corners were bad,
but maybe they aren't so much
after all. There are a few
levels where I definitely use
them to my advantage even though
for the most part I don't like
them. Depending on the types of
enemies that are around I find
that often if I put myself in a
corner I get stuck and can't get
out.

So, while I personally try to
stay out of corners, Kilroy84
has emailed me and says that
putting himself in a corner
allows him to identify who is
where and then prioritize what
he wants to do.

I guess the most I can say here
is judge the level layout and
the types of enemies that are
around as to whether you should
use the corners or stay away
from them.

~~~~ Saving Grace ~~~~ Bombs are
your saving grace. Don't forget
you have them! It's easy to
forget you have them and it's
also easy to want to stray away
from using them because of the
fact that the enemies they take
out aren't worth any points. But
think of it this way, if you die
with a 150x multiplier you are
back to a 1x multiplier. Then it
takes at least the next 149
enemies to get back to the 150x
multiplier that you were at.

So, if you are in a life-death
situation drop a bomb! It'll
clear the whole screen and give
you a second to regain your
ground.

Another use I have for bombs is
sometimes when I get a bunch of
them built up I like to destroy
a bunch of enemies and then drop
one so that I have a chance to
collect all the geoms,
especially if there are Mutators
around who drop the nice big
geoms.

New to Galaxies is the idea of
Drones. Whether you want it or
not, they are here to assist you
in each level. They are
literally a sort of helper bot
that flies along with you
through each level and each one
has a different specialty. Some
are better for different levels,
but each has it's advantage.
Hopefully in the section about
each planet I can give you some
helpful info about which ones to
use where, but here let's just
look at what each one does.

As you play levels the drones
will gain experience and every
100 exp they will level up. (not
positive, but) I assume that
leveling up increases each ones
specialty and makes it smarter
or better in a helpful sort of
way. Yeah, that's kind of vague,
but it's probably true.

I've decided that I will give
each one a "Usefulness" rating
between 1 to
5. In general each one does have
   a purpose, but for scoring
   Gold
medals there are some that
really stand above the rest.
This is soley my opinion so
ignore it if you want, but if
you're stuck on which one to use
maybe my votes will point you in
the right direction.

** For more in depth info on
   drones there is a FAQ
   dedicated soley to them!
   While I am trying to cover
   the game more broadly, you
   should check it out if that
   is what you want info on. **
    ________
___/ Attack \___________________
Cost: 0 Geoms Behavior: Attacks
in the same direction you are
shooting. Usefulness Rating: 5
    ________
___/ Defend \___________________
Cost: 3,500 Geoms Behavior:
Travels behind you shooting
backwards. Usefulness Rating: 5
    _________
___/ Collect \__________________
Cost: 14,500 Geoms Behavior:
Flys around collecting geoms
around you. Usefulness Rating: 2

*I just want to note here that I
 have had a disagreance with
 this rating,
while I'm not going to change
it, because these were my
opinions. May it be known that
this drone can be helpful in
quickly upping your multiplier*
    _______
___/ Snipe \____________________
Cost: 28,000 Geoms Behavior:
This Drone literally picks out
targets and then snipes them. It
  shot will also pierce through
  enemies.
Usefulness Rating: 2
    _______
___/ Sweep \____________________
Cost: 57,000 Geoms Behavior:
Flys in circles around your ship
and if enemies run into it they
  die. This becomes extremely
  affective at high levels.
Usefulness Rating: 4
    _____
___/ Ram \______________________
Cost: 90,000 Geoms Behavior:
Finds enemies around you and
rams into them to kill them.
Usefulness Rating: 1
    ________
___/ Turret \___________________
Cost: 150,000 Geoms Behavior:
Positions itself and shoots in
circles around it for a time.
Usefulness Rating: 4
   ______
__/ Bait \______________________
Cost: 300,000 Geoms Behavior:
Literally acts as a bait to the
enemies. Usefulness Rating: 1

As I said, there's a great FAQ
with detailed info on all these
so I'm being purposefully vague
here, check it out if you need
more depth on Drones.

There are two "categories" of
enemies in this game. "Classic
enemies" refers to enemies from
the original Geometry Wars game,
and "New Enemies" are enemies
new to Galaxies. Doesn't make
any difference if you haven't
played the XBLA game, but if you
have and wanna know about the
new enemies they are broken up
in this way.

They all have a fairly basic
look and behavior, but I'll try
and give a little description of
both so you can get an idea of
how they act. I'll also put the
color each enemy is (which will
hopefully help avoid confusion
between 2 similarly shaped
enemies) and a "strategy" for
killing them. There isn't really
a strategy to most enemies, but
I don't know what else to call
this.

: note : Thanks to Kevin for
sending me the Base points and
Geoms for the enemies!
   _____________________
__/ Classic Enemy Types \_______
________________________________
____[#CLASS]
~~~~ Wanderer ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Kinda like a propeller
Color: Purple Base Points: 25
Geoms Dropped: 10 Behavior: As
the name implies, they kinda
just wander around with no real
  set path. They are pretty slow
  moving and easy to kill.
  Essentially
   the most basic of enemies.
Strategy: Just shoot 'em. They
only take one hit so you can fly
straight at
  them while shooting and you'll
  be fine.

~~~~ Grunt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Diamond Color: Blue Base
Points: 50 Geoms Dropped: 20
Behavior: Heads straight for
your ship, nothing special.
Strategy: Just shoot 'em. Yeah,
I said it for wanderer's to.

  Fun fact: I've been told that
  if you let these guys just sit
  around (for literally, like 2
  minutes) they will gain speed
  to the point where they become
  faster than your ship!

~~~~ Weaver ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Diamond in a Square Color:
Green Base Points: 100 Geoms
Dropped: 50 Behavior: Annoying!
These guys will avoid your shots
and then work their way
  at you.
Strategy: Kilroy84 has pointed
out an important point on
Weavers so I am
  revising the strategy here.
  The Weavers like to dodge
  pretty much every shot,
  whether it is direction
  towards them or not. So, a
  "Turret Drone" style sweep
  they will more than likely
  just dodge infinitely.
  However, a direct on shot is
  much more difficult for them
  to dodge and will kill them no
  problem (unless there are
  other misguided shots around
  them).

  It's also helpful to get these
  guys cornered so that they
  have no where to dodge.

~~~~ Spinner ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: X in a Square Color: Pink
Base Points: 100 Geoms Dropped:
0 Behavior: These guys come
straight for you, but release 3
Tiny Spinners after
  being destroyed.
Strategy: It only takes 1 shot
to beat these guys, and they
behave just as
  the grunts, however, you want
  to watch out when you kill
  them because of the Tiny
  Spinners they release. It's
  good to shoot and then
  slightly back off (if you have
  the space behind you) to avoid
  these little guys, or just
  make sure you plow straight
  through and don't give the
  little ones a chance to catch
  you off guard.

~~~~ Tiny Spinner ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Tiny version of the
Spinners...literally Color: Pink
Base Points: 50 Geoms Dropped:
10 Behavior: Another really
annoying one, they do a circular
pattern while
  moving towards you. Can be
  very sneaky when there are a
  lot of enemies on screen and
  you aren't watching them.
  Elminate quickly!
Strategy: These guys only come
from defeating Spinners, and
you'll more than
  likely destroy the first one
  when you defeat the Spinner
  itself. But the other two you
  really have to watch out that
  they don't catch you off
  guard. It's usually best to
  back off right after defeating
  a Spinner and spray some shots
  in that direction to get these
  guys; or plow straight through
  the Spinner then spray some
  shots behind you to hopefully
  get these guys.

~~~~ Gravity Well ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Big Circle Color: Red Base
Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Harmless until shot,
but after one shot starts
sucking in any
  enemies (or you) that get to
  close. As it sucks in enemies
  it swells up until it can't
  hold anymore at which point it
  releases several protons out.

  Often these can become hard to
  approach because they will
  pull enemies into orbit around
  them. Also note that when they
  explode they push enemies away
  from them.
Strategy: There are two ways to
go about these: First is the way
I like,
  when you see one go straight
  towards it and take it out.
  Then you don't have to worry
  about it exploding. Or, you
  could shoot it once and let it
  fill up a bit and then destroy
  it. Each shot makes it shrink
  in size slightly until it's
  gone, and as it fills up with
  stuff it will be worth more
  points than if you destroy it
  when it's empty, but you also
  run the risk of it rupturing.

~~~~ Proton ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Small Circle Color: Blue
Base Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Fast and head straight
for you. Strategy: These guys
won't come out unless you let a
Gravity Well explode,
  but when they do watch out
  because they come quick and
  several will come out at a
  time. They die in one hit, but
  can easily catch you off guard
  due to their speed.

~~~~ Snake ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Like a snake! Color:
Yellow body, Blue head Base
Points: 150 Geoms Dropped: 50
Behavior: These guys snake
around in funky patterns, real
long bodies. Strategy: Getting
in between a handful of these
can be a real headache and
  can call for a good bombing
  due to the fact that you can
  only defeat them by shooting
  them in the head. Shooting
  their bodies will do nothing,
  but running in to any part of
  them will kill you.

  I've been told by a few people
  that you can fly through the
  tails of these snakes. So
  that's something else to keep
  in mind, also (haven't tried
  this) I've been told that
  snakes have a sort of blind
  spot that allows you to
  actually just sit still (yes,
  not move at all) and they will
  not be able to hit you. Of
  course, this will only be of
  assistance in an area with
  only snakes.

~~~~ Repulsor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Like your ship with a
shield in front Color: Red Base
Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: These guys will head
at you and follow you around.
However, their
  ability to turn is much worse
  than yours so sometimes they
  have to stop, turn, and then
  start moving again.
Strategy: You can't hit these
guys straight on due to their
shield, but if
  do a quick circle around them
  when they head you they will
  have to stop to get back on
  track and that is the perfect
  time to shoot them. Like the
  Snakes, several of these on
  screen at once usually calls
  for a good bombing in my case,
  but they are manageable with
  some practice.

~~~~ Mayfly ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Small Triangles Color:
Blue Base Points: ? Geoms
Dropped: ? Behavior: These are
like a flocking type enemy. They
always come in packs
  and travel on a fairly quick
  path straight at you.
Strategy: With these guys you
really want to shoot straight
into them and
  fly in the same direction.
  Because they always travel in
  packs you want to cut straight
  through the pack one way and
  then turn around and cut
  through it again (if you don't
  get them all the first time)
  because they travel at a
  decent speed and can flock
  around you easy if you aren't
  careful.
   _________________
__/ New Enemy Types \___________

~~~~ Mutator ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: All Ziggity Zaggety
(yeah..) Color: Blue Base
Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Float around and
occasionally spawns mutateds
Strategy: I'm not sure I
completely understand this
enemy, but from what
  I've picked up they just kind
  of linger around and then and
  random intervals will spawn
  out some mutateds (maybe like
  3-5). They can be an annoying
  enemy when to many are around
  because of the fact that they
  spawn other enemies, but also
  because they are one of the
  few enemies that take more
  than one hit to defeat.

  Okay, from what I've gathered
  the Mutators actually require
  another enemy spawn Mutateds.
  So what they like to do are
  latch onto another enemy and
  then after a short time you
  get a handful of Mutateds to
  deal with. You need to
  especially be careful when
  there are Cell Masses around
  Mutators because they will
  latch on and just keep
  spawning Mutateds over and
  over.

~~~~ Mutated ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Kinda like a Biohazard
symbol Color: Blue Base Points:
? Geoms Dropped: ? Behavior:
Quick moving and head for you.
Similar to the Mayflowers or
Protons. Strategy: These guys
spawn from the Mutators so the
quicker you can take
  those out the less of these
  you'll have to deal with. As
  far as killing them though I
  recommend a little bit of a
  backward movement while
  shooting at them because they
  come in fast and kind of
  swarm.

~~~~ UFO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: A big Eye Color: Red Base
Points: 5000 Geoms Dropped: 0
Behavior: Fly in and out at
random times on certain levels
Strategy: Defeat it if you see
it because it's worth good
points. Normally
  doesn't stick around long
  though can move quickly.

~~~~ Generator ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Double ringed circle with
enemy symbol in the middle
Color: Red when releasing
enemies, Blue when vulnerable
Base Points: 150(ish?) Geoms
Dropped: 100 Behavior: These
guys have 2 states to them, when
they are red they will
  release a constant flow of
  enemies. The enemy type is
  different based on the level
  you are on, or just the
  Generator type in general, but
  are *usually* one of the basic
  Classic enemies. After they
  have released a number of
  enemies, they turn blue for
  awhile and do nothing. After a
  short time they switch back to
  red and repeat.
Strategy: You can only defeat
these when they are blue and I
recommend you
  get rid of them as quickly as
  possible. While releasing
  enemies I like to sit kind of
  close to them and shoot at
  them to take out the enemies
  quickly then when it stops a
  few shots will do it in.

~~~~ Black Hole ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: A big swirling vortex,
usually in the center of a
planet. Color: Blue Base Points:
0 Geoms Dropped: 0 Behavior:
Switches between a clockwise and
counter-clockwise pull. Creates
  a swirling effect on the
  planet. Trying to fly against
  is like trying to swim
  upstream and the opposite when
  you go with it. On planets
  that have these they are
  usually right in the middle.
Strategy: These cannot be
defeated, so there really isn't
much strategy
  to be said here. I recommend
  fighting "upstream" because
  then the enemies are coming at
  you instead of from your
  backside.

~~~~ Asteroids ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Bigger versions of normal
enemies Color: Orange Base
Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Just float around,
then explode into two smaller
versions of
  themselves, then those each
  explode into a bunch of the
  enemies that the resemble.
  When they explode they push
  everything away.

  Here are some numbers (thanks
  to Kevin):
  - Grunt Asteroids spawn
    somewhere between 14-22
    Grunts
  - Wanderer Asteroids spawn
    between 14-26 Wanderers
Strategy: These guys can be
overwhelming if to many get on
screen because
  after you fight a few you'll
  soon realize that for every
  one asteroid you see, you've
  got something like 20 enemies
  on your hands. But they won't
  do anyting until you shoot
  them so you'll want to kind of
  corner them (if you can) and
  then just keep the shots on
  them steady so that as they
  break apart you can defeat all
  of the enemies that come out
  of them real easily.

  Watch out for when these
  explode in the narrow levels
  because they can push a lot of
  enemies on to you (or you on
  to a lot of enemies).

~~~~ Cell Mass ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Kind of like frog eggs all
bunched together Color: Beige
Base Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: None Strategy: These
guys really don't do anything,
they are just there to be
  an obstacle in your way and
  can be a pain when there are a
  lot of them all bunched
  together. Certain levels will
  just have bunches of them here
  and there and you'll want to
  make sure you get rid of them
  every now and then so that
  they don't reproduce and
  become to overwhelming.

  These often appear on levels
  that have Mutators because
  they are an easy target for
  the Mutators to latch on and
  create Mutateds from.

~~~~ Dart ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Like a paper airplane
Color: Red Base Points: ? Geoms
Dropped: ? Behavior: Slightly
hard to describe, but they kind
of zig-zag around. Strategy:
These guys are really easy to
run into because of their
pattern.
  Where most enemies you can
  just plow straight through
  knowing that the ones around
  you won't hit you and you'll
  kill the ones in front of you,
  with the pattern of these guys
  it's real easy for the ones
  around you to hit you so
  personally I prefer to just
  back off for a second and
  defeat these guys before
  moving in.

~~~~ Neutron ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: A Circle with 3 smaller
attached circles Color: Blue
Base Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Fast and head straight
for you, but kind of surround
you at the
  same time. Slow when turning
  around.
Strategy: These guys are almost
like bigger protons, except they
appear at
  any time like other normal
  enemies. I like to defeat them
  while flying backwards a bit
  because of how they try to
  surround your ship slighlty.
  Flying backwards causing them
  to land right in front of you
  so you can take them out with
  easy.

  Similar to Repulsors, circling
  around these to cause them to
  have to turn around can be
  extremely effective.

~~~~ NUFO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Smaller eyes Color: Orange
Base Points: 500 Geoms Dropped:
0 Behavior: These guys will be
floating around various levels
in huge packs.
  They can't hurt you, but are
  worth decent points if you
  kill them. They do try to
  avoid your shots though when
  you shoot at them, but since
  they don't move very quickly
  is pretty easy to get 'em.
Strategy: Just fly into a pack
of them without shooting then
fire a handful
  of shots in various directions
  to take some out. Don't focus
  on them when you see them
  because they won't hurt you if
  you fly over them. They are
  worth grabbing though when you
  have the chance for easy
  points.

~~~~ Wormhole ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Blue hole that has that
effect like when you shoot
Gravity Wells. Color: Blue Base
Points: 0 Geoms Dropped: 0
Behavior: Just sit there and
look like they are sucking in
although they
  have no pull.
Strategy: Cannot be defeated,
ues them to transport from one
to the other.

~~~~ Meteor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Squares/Diamonds depending
on falling angle Color: Red Base
Points: ? Geoms Dropped: ?
Behavior: Some levels literally
have Meteor showers in which
tons of meteors
  fall across the screen in
  different directions. These
  will hurt you and you will
  have to destroy them to
  survive. They normally grid
  the whole screen, or a decent
  chunk of the screen when they
  "shower".
Strategy: Just aim in the
opposite direction they are
falling and shoot. You
  will destroy the ones that are
  a direct threat to you by
  doing this. If there are a lot
  of enemies around while
  meteors are falling just try
  to be shooting in the opposite
  direction of the meteors no
  matter which way you are
  flying to keep them from
  hitting you.

~~~~ Mine Layer ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: A Jaggedy type circle
Color: Blue, mines are little
green circles Base Points: n/a
Geoms Dropped: n/a Behavior:
These guys fly around laying
mines on the ground and then
setting
  them off. To be honest, I've
  never been hit by one of the
  mines and don't even know if
  they can harm you or if they
  harm the enemies, but you can
  definitely run into them and
  will be killed if you do.
Strategy: You can't kill these
guys, but the mines do indeed
have a purpose.
  If you kill enemies by setting
  them off you get double points
  for each enemy they kill, but
  the same number of Geoms. This
  can net you some huge points
  if you kill NUFO's with them
  (about 150,000 each when you
  have a 150x multiplier!) <-
  Thanks to Kevin for this info!

  Following strategy sent in
  courtesy of Phizzo89:
  Basically, any level with a
  Mine Layer is a guaranteed
  Gold Medal because this
  "enemies" actually helps you
  mroe than it hurts you. The
  only way that it can harm you
  is if you run into it, which
  you really shouldn't do
  because it's super obvious
  where it is (in the DS version
  with the toned down graphics
  at least). The mines are
  totally harmless, you can sit
  right over them when they
  explode and it won't harm you
  at all, but it will destroy
  enemies if they are over top
  of one when it goes off.

  A mine layer will lay about
  6-8 mines and then after that
  it will keep moving around,
  but won't lay any more mines
  until you blow up the ones
  that are already out there. To
  trigger a mine you simply fly
  over it (completely over it,
  not just skim the edge) and
  about
  1.5 seconds later that mine
    will blow up creating a
    chain reaction
to any other mines within range.

  So, where this really comes in
  handy is when your screen is
  packed and your getting rocked
  just fly over a mine and set
  it off to take care of this
  guys really easy and get some
  major points. So, set off one
  of these mines in a row of
  them when the screen is jam
  packed and your bound to not
  only clear it but get
  literally millions of points
  from it.

  Another good use of them is
  not only for points, but as a
  last stand type of thing. If
  your about to die and there
  are mines around try to set
  them off to give you a
  fighting chance.

  The rate that Mines are laid
  is rather slow and there
  doesn't seem to be any way to
  speed it up. So, it's
  recommended that you simply
  let it lay it's mines and
  leave them alone until you are
  ready to use them or have no
  other choice, but to set them
  off.

  That's all there is to it!
  Drive directly over one to set
  off a chain reaction of all
  that are near and do some
  major screen clearing and
  insane point grabbing.

~~~~ Flipper ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look: Square Color: Blue Base
Points: n/a Geoms Dropped: n/a
Behavior: These are basically
moving boundries in the middle
of the playing
  field. You'll know them by the
  fact that at periodic
  intervals they will flip and
  move their position. They
  can't hurt you and you won't
  die by running into them, as I
  said, they are just like
  walls. But they do block your
  shots and you do need to work
  around
    them to defeat enemies.
Strategy: As I said, you can't
kill them, so there's really no
strategy here.

 0______________________________

 o------------------------------
*in the following synopis the
 word planet and level are
 interchangeable,
sorry in advance for the
inconsitancy of use*

Galaxies is broken down into
Galaxies and planets. Each one
plays a little differently from
the last, well, for the most
part. At the beginning of the
game the first Galaxy and the
first 3 planets are open for you
to explore. From there on you'll
need to use the Geoms you
collect in the levels to buy new
galaxies and planets to play in.

After playing each planet, if
you did well enough you will be
rewarded a medal. There are 3
medals in each planet: Bronze,
Silver and Gold. Each planet has
a different point requirement
for each medal.

Most planets will start you with
3 lives and 3 bombs and you can
gain more lives and bombs by
collecting a certain number of
geoms. However, some levels will
start you with only 1 life and
no bombs, in these levels you
are limited to one life and no
bombs.

Whenever you choose a planet you
will then be given the choice of
which drone you would like to
take with you for the current
run. The drone you choose has no
effect on the medals or geoms in
the level, but is really up to
your personal preference of
which one you like the most.
Only the drone you use in that
level will gain experience from
that level.

I think that's all the basics
let's take a further look at
each galaxy and planet.

: note : All costs are referring
to Geoms, all medals are
referring to
 points earned in a single run
: note : I was going to list the
enemy types that you will find
in each
  level, however, most levels
  seem to change enemy types as
  you get more and more points,
  so some of these lists would
  be huge and others would be
  incomplete if I wasn't scoring
  enough points. So, I decided
  to leave that out.
: note : On some of the funny
shaped levels I'll try and Ascii
draw the
  layouts, but some are to funny
  looking and the others are to
basic, so no drawings for those.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o
  Essentially this is meant to
  be a training level for the
  game. If you're new to the
  series this is a good place to
  play a few times and try and
  get used to the controls.
  Enemies come pretty constantly
  from the corners of the stage
  and not much more happens.

  This is also a pretty good
  stage for leveling up Drones
  due to it's easy difficulty.

    2. Trainer Duo

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Yet
  another training level. Slow
  to start, but kicks it in to
  gear not to far in. You'll be
  faced with a ton of enemies
  before your a million points
  in. Just keep practicing and
  learning how to play the game
  here, it's a good stage for
  learning how to move and
  handle lots of enemies at the
  same time.

   Recommended Drone: Defend
  Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level will be your first
  encounter with Asteroids and
  can be overwhelming at first.
  At the beginning of the level
  you'll only have 1 or 2
  asteroids on screen at a time,
  but it doesn't take long for
  there to be quite a few more
  surrounding you along with
  Wanderers spawning regularly.
  Due to the level layout being
  very short you'll want to work
  up and down as little as
  possible and left and right as
  much as possible.

  Since on the left and right
  there are flat areas you can
  get the asteroids wedged into,
  your best bet is to shoot them
  into those directions so that
  they explode while they are in
  there and all the enemies are
  all bunched up with nowhere to
  go for you to destroy very
  quick and easily.

  Keep in mind as well that you
  do have bombs on this stage
  and don't be afraid to use
  them in a situation where you
  get cornered. Watch out as
  well for the Spinner Asteroids
  when they come out because
  there will be a lot of Tiny
  Spinners for you to deal with
  when you get the main Spinners
  defeated and if you are
  cornered when you destroy
  those Asteroids you can easily
  cost yourself a life.

    2. Claduo
  o-| I-n-f-o |-o Cost: 860
  Bronze: 2,000,000 Silver:
  5,000,000 Gold: 11,000,000
  Layout: Large Square, no
  obstacles. Recommended Drone:
  Turret, Attack or Defend.
  Starting Lives: 3 Initial
  Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o I
  recommend the 3 drones above
  because they all help you
  attack and defeat enemies and
  this level has a lot of
  enemies. The reason there are
  so many enemies here is
  because a lot of Generators
  spawn on this planet. Mainly
  Grunt and Wanderer Generators,
  but when there are 3 or 4 of
  them on screen at a time you
  can easily find yourself in a
  sea of 100+ Wanderers. Granted
  these aren't to hard to kill
  and can actually be a lot of
  fun to battle against such
  ridiculous numbers it's nice
  to have a drone out there
  who's helping you out to watch
  your back and fend off these
  guys with you.

  There's really not to much
  strategy though because the
  challenge is just that there
  are a ton of enemies. I
  personally like to kind of
  stay close to an edge (but not
  on the edge so you don't get
  enemies spawned on top of you)
  and shoot towards the middle.
  This allows me to clear out
  lots of enemies while being
  out of harms way a bit. But
  then when a lot of enemies get
  close to me I just fly
  straight through them all
  shooting to another side and
  go back and forth until I have
  a comfortable spot to sit
  again. Trust in your guns on
  this one.

  Also keep an eye out for
  Gravity Wells appearing in the
  parts of the screen that you
  can't see because if you set
  one off and don't know it, it
  doesn't take much time for it
  to fill up and explode because
  of the number of enemies
  spawning on this planet.

    3. Sureis
  o-| I-n-f-o |-o Cost: 875
  Bronze: 400,000 Silver:
  1,850,000 Gold: 5,000,000
  Layout: Large Octagon
  Recommended Drone: Defend or
  Turret Starting Lives: 1
  Initial Bombs: 0

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Once
  again because there are no
  boundries and this planet has
  a lot of open space I'm
  recommending you use a drone
  that can help you fend off
  enemies. Since you only have 1
  life I dropped Attack off the
  list and I highly recommend
  Defend because it shoots
  behind you and can get that
  one you don't see.

  This level starts off with a
  bang though, a lot of
  Wanderers and Grunts right
  from the beginning. Like I
  said, it's an open area so
  there is a decent amount of
  room to move, but you have to
  be extra careful with only 1
  life and no bombs. Since the
  level is basically circular in
  shape it's really easy to just
  fly around in circles
  alternating shots between
  straight ahead of you and
  behind you.

  Flying in circles will cause
  enemies to cluster up behind
  you and just kinda linger
  chase you so then when you get
  an opening in front of your
  ship you can shoot at the mass
  behind you and collect some
  serious points. Defend helps
  out a lot here to because it's
  always shooting behind you so
  you only have to half worry
  about that mass.

  Recommended Drone: Turret or
  Attack Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level is what I call wave
  based. Most other levels have
  enemies kind of randomly
  spawning all over the place,
  but this one is really set up
  in waves. A line of enemies
  all across the top will head
  down, then another, etc.
  Throughout this time there
  will be random spawns here and
  there, but for the most part
  it'll be waves coming down
  from the top.

  This leaves the obvious
  strategy of hanging out by the
  bottom. What I like to do is
  kinda linger in the middle of
  the screen and move from left
  to right while shooting at the
  top of the screen while waves
  appear. This makes it pretty
  easy to take out the waves
  right when they come out. You
  have to keep your eye out for
  those randomly spawning
  enemies though because when
  they get beneath you it's easy
  for them to kill you if you
  aren't careful.

  Not to long in you'll also
  find that Generators start
  appearing at the bottom. When
  this happens you're probably
  going to want to make them
  priority so do you don't get
  cornered.

  The many creveces in this
  screen can be good for
  trapping enemies in, but bad
  for getting yourself trapped
  in. Especially if something
  decides it's going to spawn
  there while you're in there so
  be careful you don't put
  yourself in one. There are a
  lot of Dart enemies in this
  level so watch out for them
  and their funky pattern as
  well. After playing this one
  for a short time though you'll
  get in a quick habit
 of how to take care of things.

  Bronze: 2,000,000 Silver:
  5,500,000 Gold: 12,500,000
  Layout: Small Octagon with
  several flippers Recommended
  Drone: Sweep or Snipe Starting
  Lives: 3 Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  stage is really tiny and the
  flippers can make it a real
  pain to defeat the enemies
  because you can't shoot
  through them, but the enemies
  can move through them. There
  are a lot of enemies in this
  stage for how small it is and
  the Generators adn Gravity
  Well's don't help any.

  I recommend the sweep drone a
  lot (especially at higher
  levels) because all the
  flippers stop bullets so any
  attacking drone is only going
  to help so much, but the sweep
  drone will help fend off
  anything that gets to close to
  you because it spins around
  you constantly. I think that
  the snipe can shoot through
  the flippers, which is why I
  recommend it, but I'm not
  positive on this. If someone
  wanted to double check that'd
  be great.

  Being another circular level I
  like to kind of do the circle
  thing around this one like the
  other octagon level, but
  because of the flippers I do a
  lot more target focused moving
  than just circling. The
  Generators are a for sure
  target everytime I see one, I
  like to go straight for them
  and take them out and then
  focus on the other things
  around.

  Drone: Defend, Turret or Sweep
  Starting Lives: 3 Initial
  Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level is a huge cluster of
  enemies. From the beginning
  there are tons of tons of
  enemies. This is why I
  recommend having a drone that
  can help you attack them or
  defend yourself. There aren't
  any Generators to watch out
  for. But you'll get all kinds
  of other basic enemies.

  The best strategy in my
  opinion is to go the circle
  route around this one. It's
  held true for Retro Evolved
  along with other levels in
  this game, but it's really a
  pretty simple and effective
  strategy. Just keep going in
  circles letting enemies build
  up behind you shooting
  straight ahead and taking out
  the cluster behind you when
  you get the chance.

  Keep your eyes out for the
  Snakes and the Repulsor's that
  start coming out not far in.
  Good news is though because of
  the large number of enemies in
  this level it's easy to gain
  extra lives and extra bombs.

  Bronze: 5,000,000 Silver:

  Layout: Large octagon with
  Mine Layers Recommended Drone:
  Defend or Sweep. Starting
  Lives: 3 Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Ahh,
  the mine layers. I don't quite
  understand these guys, but
  they just kind of fly around
  laying mines everywhere. If
  you run into them, they will
  cost you your life, however, I
  don't know that the mines
  really do any harm. You also
  can't kill them. So, for these
  reasons, I consider them to be
  an obstacle. So, keep your eye
  out for them.

  This level once again has a
  lot of enemies, however,
  requires a lot more Geoms to
  gain bombs or lives so it's
  likely that you won't be
  gaining to many throughout
  playing like you may have in
  the last one. On a more
  positive note, 50,000,000
  points will come a lot quicker
  on this one that the
  33,000,000 on the last level.

  There are a lot of Darts and
  Gravity Wells along with most
  of the basic enemies in this
  level so you need to kind of
  curve the way your playing
  based on the types of enemies
  that are currently out. The
  Defend will help a lot with
  it's backwards shooting, but I
  also like sweep because
  bullets get stopped by the
  mines and sweep is also
  protecting close by. Not to
  much of a technical strategy
  though. I recommend the
  circling technique as usual
  and keep the number of Darts
  and Gravity Wells on screen
  down as they are probably the
  most dangerous.

  Recommended Drone: Turret or

  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Lots
  of Spinners in this level make
  it very difficult to manevuer
  comfortably. Most of the enemy
  waves like to appear on either
  2 or all sides of your ship at
  the same time so you are
  almost having to cut through
  enemies to get to a save zone
  and clear the screen off.
  These Spinners can make this a
  very uneasy task due to the
  Tiny Spinners that they are
  always spawning.

  I'm not really sure what to
  recommend because you really
  have to just cut back and
  forth through the enemies and
  try and keep yourself out of
  the creveces, but around the
  edges to clear out the middle
  areas.

  Recommended Drone: Defend,

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Pretty
  standard level. The hexagon
  shape isn't much different
  than the Octagon, you have no
  reason to stick yourself in
  the top and bottom corners so
  it's basicallly just a circle
  while playing.

  If you've been following this
  guide like a walkthrough you
  can probably predict the
  strategy I'm about to give, if
  you just jumped into this
  level I'll state it again for
  good measure.

  Go in circles, let the enemies
  bunch up behind you and take
  them out when you get the
  chance. Defend is a great
  Drone to use because it shoots
  behind you while you fly
  forward, but turret helps out
  to because it'll clear out a
  lot of dudes while you fly
  around.

  There are a particularly large
  amount of snakes in this level
  so keep your eyes out for them
  and shoot for the head. You'll
  also encounter Mutator's
  though they look more
  threatening than they really
  are.

  Recommended Drone: Attack or
  Sweep Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is another claustrophobic
  asteroid filled level. Up
  until the Bronze medal is
  pretty slow and you'll only
  need to focus on one Asteroid
  at a time; general rule
  applies, keep 'em cornered and
  take 'em out quick. I
  recommend the attack drone
  because then you always have
  double the fire power on the
  Asteroids. I don't recommend
  defend or turret because the
  last thing you want in a level
  like this is an asteroid
  behind you exploding and
  sending enemies at you while
  you are destroying one in
  front of you and then you end
  up with enemies on all sides
  and no where to go.

  After the bronze medal this
  level gets real frantic real
  fast though because generators
  start coming out along with
  Gravity Wells. The Generators
  like to spawn in large groups,
  like 4 or 5 of them at the
  same time so do all that is in
  your power to destroy them as
  quick as possible because they
  can make impossible amounts of
  enemies along with the
  increasingly rapid spawning
  asteroids.

  Keep the Asteroids cornered no
  matter how many appear on
  screen and don't let one side
  build up while you take out
  the other side because then
  you won't even be able to work
  through the other side. Try to
  keep your destruction evenly
  spaced out and you should be
  able to rack up some major
  points here.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Now,
  lets look at the layout of
  this level for a second. It's
  small first off, and all of
  those blocks and diamonds are
  obstacles in your way. You
  can't pass through them, your
  bullets can't and nor can the
  enemies. So you've got a few
  tight corridors to work with.
  Enemies like to spawn from all
  four corners in large numbers
  and generators like to appear
  somewhere in the middle.

  Because the enemies in this
  game don't exactly have
  intelligence, you can use all
  of the boundries to your
  advantage. For example, if
  enemies appear in the middle
  and you are on the bottom and
  sit right under one of the
  side blocks shooting towards
  the middle they'll kind of
  struggle their way around the
  block to get to you and get
  hit right when they get
  around. This is a good
  strategy to keep in mind.

  The problem is that large
  masses like to appear in the
  corners, more specifically -
  more than one corner at a
  time. So you need to watch out
  for those guys while dealing
  with guys in the middle.
  Although it doesn't sound like
  it would work in this level, I
  like to take care of the
  corner spawning guys by doing
  circles around the outside
  corridor. It's such a tight
  space that nothing can really
  get you from the side as long
  as you keep on moving.

  When Generators appear in the
  middle (as they like to do) I
  like to do a quick run through
  there and then stop on the
  other side and shoot back
  towards the middle to take out
  any followers. You'll probably
  get in a pretty decent rythmn
  after playing the level a bit.

  I recommend the Sweep drone
  because it's always around you
  and if anythings tried to get
  you from the side when you're
  rushing it has a good chance
  of taking it out. Anything
  that shoots is pretty much
  useless with all these
  obstacles to block shots.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or

  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is officially a level that you
  cannot play by going around in
  circles because the layout
  simply will not allow it. So,
  I like to basically play this
  level in quadrants. I consider
  each square it's own quadrent.

  The enemies in this level sort
  of come in phases. There will
  be no enemies, or very few
  enemies for awhile, then
  you'll get a bunch of
  (probably wanderer) spawns
  from a quadrent or two, then
  probably some generators and
  random spawns, then it
  repeats.

  During the down times I like
  to just travel up and down
  through all quadrents killing
  off the NUFO's around and any
  random enemies that appear.
  Then when the mass wanderer
  spawns start to happen I hang
  out around there and take them
  out. When a quad is clear I
  move on to the neighboring one
  to see if anything is
  happening there. If there is
  something, I deal with it, if
  not I move on to the next.

  Whenever Generators appear I
  hang out by them for awhile as
  if they were mass wanderer
  spawn points and take care of
  anything they generate along
  with the Generator itself.
  Rinse and repeat.

  It's a pretty slow paced level
  and isn't to difficult.
  Because of it's shape the
  defense drone is pretty good
  so you can basically be
  shooting through all of the
  quadrents at the same time.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Very
  similar to the last level that
  looked like this only turned
  90 degrees. Enemies like to
  appear in waves on the right
  side and head left. So, what
  works for me is to have a
  drone attacking with me and
  hang out near the left side
  attacking the right in top to
  bottom type movements. Keep a
  close eye out for Gravity
  Wells that like to appear in
  line with the enemy waves.

  Keep an eye to your backside
  though for Gravity Wells and
  other mischievious beings. If
  that doesn't help you much
  check out planet Bateis in the
  Beta galaxy because it was
  basically the same level.
  Maybe that strategy will help
  you out.

  enemies start coming at you.
  Pretty much all the standard
  enemies are here in fair
  amounts: Spinners, Grunts,
  Weavers and Gravity Wells.
  Standard rules apply to,
  circle theory.

  Try to keep moving in circles
  letting all the guys build up
  behind you while taking out
  the ones in front of you and
  then the cluster when you have
  some breathing room. Turret
  and Defend will both help due
  to the sheer amount of room in
  this level. With the large
  number of foes it can be hard
  to stay alive, but easy to
  collect lives and bombs.

  Alright, since I've had some
  very helpful info sent in to
  me about Mine Layers I now
  understand why this level is
  set up how it is. There are a
  few Mine Layers you'll need to
  watch out for running in to,
  but mainly your going to want
  to use their mines to net you
  some huge points. If you've
  read the Mine Layer strategy
  in the enemies section you're
  good to go on this planet
  already, but let me give you a
  short run down here (head
  there for more info).

  As I said there are a few Mine
  Layers here laying mines for
  you, your going to want to
  avoid flying over the mines
  because they will be very
  useful to you after a handful
  of them get laid out on
  screen. It takes a bit of time
  for the enemies to really
  swarm up in this level, but
  use the early ones to build up
  your combo then when the
  NUFO's start pouring on screen
  and the enemy spawns start
  building
up start setting off the mines.

  To set off a mine just fly
  completely over it (not
  partially, COMPLETELY) and
  this will start a chain
  reaction to all nearby mines
  and every enemy killed by a
  mine will give you DOUBLE
  points! A few good mine
  explosions and you'll have a
  Gold Medal like it was
  nothing.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is a fun chaotic level here.
  You don't haev much room to
  move around and the enemies
  spawn quick and all over the
  place. This planet spawns a
  lot of Grunts and Darts. The
  Grunts are easy to take care
  of, but be weary of the Darts
  when rounding corners.

  I like to treat this level
  like it's 2 halves, the right
  and left. During the early
  parts you can kind of wander
  where you please because it's
  not to hectic yet. Hoewver, as
  it goes on you'll probably
  want to get in the habit of
  having a pattern for yourself.

  I go across the top from right
  to left and clear out the far
  left side then run across the
  bottom and clear out the right
  side. If both sides are ever
  clear and stuff gets stuck in
  the middle I then take the
  time to clear that part. I
  like to just keep repeating
  this pattern because the top
  and bottom parts are nice thin
  paths you can't really get hit
  on and the sides are where
  enemies build up and you'll
  rack up all your points and
  Geoms.

  As far as Drones go the Sweep
  is the ultimate for this level
  because it can sweep through
  the boundries. For example, on
  the right boundry thing if you
  sit on the bottom of the part
  that sticks out to the left
  and there are enemies on top
  your sweep can kill them
  without you even having any
  risk! It's great!

  Another 1 life level, this one
  is pretty hectic, but it's not
  that bad. The circle method
  implies, if you don't know
  what that is by this point in
  the game just look back in
  pretty much any of the
  previous planets and read up
  on it.

  The little peaks that stick
  out can be off-putting
  sometimes when circling around
  because you need to basically
  stay that far away from the
  edges at all times. But with a
  few tries you'll get the feel
  for the area. Lot's of Grunts
  and Wanderers to fend off, so
  no real tricky enemies and the
  Defend and Turret Drones will
  help immensely.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level can be very difficult
  because it has mass amounts of
  all the annoying enemies. Lots
  of Spinners, Weavers, Snakes
  and Neutrons. All together
  these can be a major headache
  because you don't have a ton
  of room and you'll have to do
  a lot of cutting through packs
  of spinners which is always a
  dangerous stunt.

  However, it is do-able as long
  as you are careful and
  vicious. Any drone that will
  be attacking with you or
  watching yoru backside is a
  plus becasue you need all the
  firepower you can get here.
  You never want to find
  yourself surround becasue with
  the peaks in the boundries
  there's really nowhere to hide
  without trapping yourself.

  If you ever get surround don't
  hesitate to use a bomb.
  Especially if you've got
  Snakes and Neutrons nearby,
  those are probably the most
  dangerous to have together
  because they are both very
  annoying to kill.

  I don't actually do much
  circling around in this level,
  but I do a lot more straight
  path cutting from one side to
  the other. I like to cut
  through the thin areas so they
  all bunch up behind me, but
  then turn around and kill as
  many as I can right away
  before cutting again. If you
  want to use this method I
  would recommend the Attack or
  Turret drones over the Defense
  one since you'll be facing the
  enemies more than staying
  ahead.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or

  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  can be a tricky level to
  circle around due to it being
  a triangle. The Defense drone
  will help a ton because if
  you're following the edges of
  the planet there will always
  be a pocket behind you and
  more than likely enemies in
  that pocket getting shot by
  your Drones fire.

  However, there are a ton of
  enemies on this planet so
  thats not really enough alone
  to pass so you need to be
  doing your part as well. What
  I like to do is still go
  around the level in a counter-
  clockwise fashion but try to
  avoid the deep pockets,
  especially the left and right
  ones. I'm decently comfortable
  with taking a short break
  towards the bottom to clear up
  any followers, but the side
  ones are to small to sit in
  and to easy to get trapped in.
  So, I literally like to take
  this level one pass at a time.

  For the most part you'll be
  seeing Wanderer's in this
  level which are pretty easy to
  take care of. Be aware that
  you are not next to their
  spawn points when they decide
  to spawn because thats a sure
  way to get yourself killed.
  You'll want to be most aware
  though of the Gravity Well's
  that appear because they will
  fill up quick and there isn't
  a ton of room to run and hide
  when they explode.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Being
  a plus sign there is no circle
  strategy in this level. For me
  it became more of a push
  through then turn around and
  fight for your life. Which
  suprisingly worked...for
  awhile. Around the time you'll
  receive the silver medal
  though it changes up a bit
  from Weavers and Darts to
  adding Repulsors and Metero
  Showers which kind of throws
  everything off. Not to mention
  the tons of Spinners you'll
need to fend off at this point.

  At this time is when you'll be
  really thankful for that Drone
  helping you out because when
  the Meteor showers start
  raining down you are going to
  want to either try to against
  or with them. In some of the
  other Meteor Shower levels you
  can survive easy by flying
  against them the whole time,
  but this level has to many
  enemies and not enough space
  to do that so you'll need to
  go with and against it.

  Trying to perpindicular with
  it is a bad idea because you
  have no way of defending
  yourself against it while
  flying this way and fending
  off the enemies in your path.
  The Defense Drone will help a
  ton when flying with it
  because it will destroy the
  Shower rocks behind you,
  however Sweep is a great
  choice to because when you get
 swarmed it can be a huge help.

  Not really a whole lot I can
  help you with here as this
  stage is pretty tough for me
  to. It's a very constrained
  area with a mass amount of
  tough enemies. Hopefully my
  little bit of advice helps
  out.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o
  Another claustrophobic
  Asteroid stage so standard
  rules apply. Let's cover the
  basics first. We want a drone
  that doesn't shoot where we
  aren't shooting so we don't
  get suprised by Asteroid's
  killed behind us. We want a
  drone that can help us up our
  attack on what we are focusing
  on or that sweet close
  protection of the Sweep drone.

  We want to corner the
  Asteroids when we attack them
  so that the enemies are
  concentrated when they explode
  and we can eliminate them
  fast. Don't let one side fill
  up with Asteroids, try to
evenly disperse your attacking.

  Now, this area in perticular
  is the smallest one yet. There
  is literally nowhere to run.
  On top of that it likes to
  spawn enemies (Grunts a lot of
  the time) all the way around
  the border no matter if there
  are Asteroids on screen or
  not. So you need to make sure
  you are ready to fend off
  these guys while taking on the
  Asteroids because this is
  going to be a very hectic
  battle (but a fun one!)

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o First
  off, I apologize for the
  really pitiful Ascii Layout
  here, it looks pretty bad, but
  point is we have another small
  field with lots of objects in
  our way so we wanna go with
  the Sweep to attack through
  them and give us a bit of a
  shield since bullets from any
  attacking drone will be
  stopped by the boundry walls
  doins us next to no good.

  If you've already played some
  of the stages of the same
  essence as this one you should
  have a good idea of how to
  treat it. If you haven't, I'll
  give you the low down.

  Stick to the outside edges as
  much as possible and keep
  moving when there are a lot of
  enemies coming at you from
  either side, or both. The
  areas are so thin that it's
  very difficult for enemies to
  hit you from the sides, or
  even for Tiny Spinners to get
  you. If you need an escape
  route jet through the middle
  to one of the other sides and
  then start looping around
  again.

  Since the A.I. isn't super
  intelligent you can use this
  to your advantage by hanging
  out underneath one of the
  blocades and if the enemies
  are coming from the other side
  of it they will kind of slowly
  inch around it and you can
  pound shots into the opening
  where they will appear killing
  them the second they round the
  corner.

  Most spawns come from the 4
  corners, but others appear in
  the middle at times, this
  includes some Generators. This
  level in particular likes to
  release a lot of Spinners so
  be careful of the Tiny
  Spinners, but like I said,
  they have a much more
  difficult time getting you
  here in these constrained
  areas than in big open areas
  where there movement pattern
  can be hard to keep track of.

  Just keep moving at a steady
  pace and keep shooting
  straight ahead. If Sweep
  doesn't work out for you try
  using Defend because it will
  cover your backside well when
  traveling around the border.

  Recommended Drone: Sweep or
  Defend Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o I'm a
  little weary to put Defend as
  a recommended drone here
  because of all the Flippers
  it's shots will get blocked a
  lot. However, not to far into
  this planet Meteor Showers
  begin and not to long after
  you start getting Meteor
  Showers from 2 sides at the
  same time and this is when
  Defend will really help you
  out. Although I think Sweep is
  an excellent choice as well,
  you'll probably have to try
  both out and see which method
  works best for you.

  This planet has a lot of
  Wanderers spawning about and
  darts flying around, not to
  forget the Meteor Showers I
  mentioned above. These types
  of enemies aren't normally to
  hard to avoid, but with the
  Flippers added in your path is
  constantly changing and you
  need to pay a lot of attention
  to where you're going so that
  you don't get caught behind a
  flipper in the middle of a
  Shower (ha, that sounds kinda
  funny).

  The best strategy I can think
  of right now is to really play
  along with what the Meteors
  do. Try to always go against
  them and make them your focus
  while taking out the enemies
  instead of trying to take out
  enemies while avoiding the
  shower, if you catch my drift.

  The enemies themselves really
  shouldn't give you much
  trouble, you've faced way
  worse in say the Asteroid
  levels, it's really just
  practicing how to deal with
  the Meteor Showers.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o You
  may recognize the layout of
  this planet from some previous
  ones and realize that it is
  yet another Wave planet!
  Except this time there are 2
  flat sides! Yeah, you get
  waves from both sides. This
  planet is also smaller than
  the previous wave based
  planets, however, I think it
  actually makes your job a
  little bit easier... at least
  for awhile.

  You will get waves of all the
  standard types of enemies:
  Spinners, Weavers, Grunts,
  Neutrons, Snakes and all those
  wonderfully hidden Gravity
  Wells you love so much. These
  waves come fast to.

  You're going to want to do all
  that is in your power to
  destroy everything as quickly
  as possible when it spawns. I
  like to really stay in there
  as close as possible so that I
  can not only take things out,
  but collect the Geoms they
  drop. One problem I find a lot
  with the wave stages is that I
  don't collect many Geoms since
  they all fall where the next
  wave spawns. If you stay in
  close enough you will be able
  to destory the enemies and
  collect them, you'll
  especially want to try and do
  this with Weaver waves since
  they drop the big Geoms.

  Up until you reach the Gold
  medal amount you'll only have
  to deal with waves from one
  side at a time. That side will
  alternate periodically, but it
  won't be both sides at once.
  So just hang in the middle
  till you know what side it's
  going to be and then go to
  town on the wave. Never stray
  to far to one side or the
  other.

  After you get the Gold Medal
  your on your own because you
  get crazy waves from both
  sides at the same tim eand I
  don't even know what to tell
  you to help you out there.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or
  Sweep Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o I had
  some trouble getting into a
  good rhythmn with this level
  and I think it's because of
  the Cell Masses. They are kind
  of a funky enemy because they
  just hang out and multiply. So
  while you will want to take
  care of them, don't make them
  your main focus. The Mutators
  will give you a lot more
  trouble than they will.

  There isn't a ton of enemies
  in this level, but the
  Mutators can give you a lot of
  trouble if you don't take care
  of them in the way that
  Generators can. Speaking of
  which, a few Generators show
  in this level as well, but
  they are few and far between
  so just take care of them as
  you come across them.

  The Mutators though like to
  run around and can be tricky
  to get because of that one
  island in this level. It
  doesn't look like much, but I
  found it in my way quite often
  and caused a few more Mutateds
  and Gravity Well explosions
  than I was comfortable with.

  As I said, I wasn't very good
  at this level so I don't have
  a good strategy to share, but
  taking care of the Mutators
  and watching out for the
  Gravity wells is key. Please
  send me any strategies you may
  have to help out here.

  Recommended Drone: Sweep or

  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Ugh,
  the flippers! So many of them
  to. This level has a lot of
  places to get stuck in and a
  lot of flippers to get caught
  on. So, that can cause it to
  be quite a headache. There are
  also a lot of Darts, which are
  unpredictable and then Snakes
  and Generators later on which
  just don't help anything.

  I recommend Sweep as usual for
  flipper levels because it can
  attack through the flippers.
  I'm also recommending Snipe
  for the same reason, however,
  I don't use it much so thats
  up to your personal testing to
  figure out how it works for
  you.

  Strategy wise you need to be
  aware of the middle area
  because Darts like to spawn in
  real big packs there. There
  have definitely been a few
  times I was hanging out in the
  area and was killed by
  spawning Darts. So be aware of
  that and also try to keep
  yourself from getting cornered
  because with all these edges
  it's easy to get backed into
  one and then get killed there
  by some Darts or Spinners
  lingering around.

  I like to kind of treat the
  middle of this level as the
  main enemy area and cut
  through it a lot from side to
  side trying to keep everything
  piled in there. Of course
  you'll need to take care of
  the enemies that spawn around
  the edges as well, but if you
  can get everything kind of
  coralled you'll be much better
  off instead of having stuff
  everywhere attacking you from
  all sides all the time. This
  level can be fairly difficult,
  mainly thanks to the flippers,
  but with some practice it can
  be manageable.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or
  Sweep Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level isn't to bad, the shape
  can cause you to corner
  yourself a lot so always be
  aware of whats around you. I
  found myself doing a lot of
  circling then hanging out in
  the bottom, but it could get
  very unnerving at times.

  Because of the straightaways
  down up the sides, across the
  top and through the middle I
  recommend defend to help you
  clear out stuff coming from
  behind you. There are a lot of
  generators in this level (and
  the number only increases as
  time goes on) so you'll be
  dealing with a lot of enemies.
  The Spinners can be
  particularly annoying because
  it's so easy to get cornered
  trying to back away from them
  that you'll often end up
  getting hit by the Tiny
  Spinners while cornered.

  I tried to play the level from
  Generator to Generator.
  Targetting one and taking care
  of it and then moving on to
  another. When I didn't have
  one in site I would just loop
  around the outside edge of
  this planet taking out
  whatever was around. As with
  most planets that have
  boundries I don't like to
  spend much time in the middle
  because it's to easy to get
  attacked from all sides.

  So, basically the circle
  method applies and Defend will
  be of help or Sweep for when
  things get tight.

  applies here in the full. Use
  it and you'll have a Gold in
  no time. Read up in the
  enemies section on Mine Layers
  to get the full strategy, but
  here it is in short.

  Take out the early enemies to
  build up your multiplier and
  let the Mine Layers lay their
  mines out for you to use when
  the enemies really start
  building up. When the waves
  start coming fast and the
  screen is getting full drive
  COMPLETELY over a mine to set
  off a chain reaction of all
  the mines on screen which will
  annihilate the enemies and
  give you DOUBLE points for
  each one killed by a mine!

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  stage is a crazy hectic
  Asteroid stage just as the
  other Asteroid stages like to
  be. However, after a few plays
  I switched to the Attack Drone
  and went to town on it. So,
  that
is why I recommend only it here.

  This Asteroid stage is more
  hectic than the others have
  been for the fact that it
  likes to spawn a lot of other
  enemies along with spawning a
  lot of Asteroids. However it's
  got a good crevece on the
  right side to destroy them in
  and 2 good ones on the left to
  keep them really focus when
  they explode.

  You'll get a lot of Neutron
  Asteroids in this level which
  can be very hard to deal with
  if you don't keep them focused
  when you destroy them because
  the Neutron's move so fast.
  But honestly, use the Attack
  drone and just work your way
  around from the right, to the
  top left, down and back to the
  right powering through
  everything in yoru path and
  you'll rock this one in no
  time.

  It's crazy and chaotic, but
  it's really not that bad.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is a good old fashioned hectic
  circle method stage. There are
  no tricks or traps here, but
  you get a healthy dosage of
  all the classic enemies:
  Weavers, Grunts and Wanderers.
  Not to mention plenty of
  Generators upping the number
  of enemies on screen.

  The Circle Method in short:
  Move in a clockwise or
  counter-clockwise fashion
  around the screen shooting
  straight ahead letting the
  enemies gather behind you and
  then when you have some
  breathing room turn around and
  destroy the mass that is
  following behind you. This
  method works great, but I
  found the biggest hassle for
  me in this level was the
  Mutateds.

  Mutadeds are very hard to see
  in the clusters of enemies in
  this level and I often ran
  into them without even
  noticing that they were there
  which of course resulted in me
  losing lives. I'm not really
  sure how to tell you to avoid
  this, but I guess I'll just
  leave it as a warning to you.

  Any Drone that is helping you
  attack will be a plus in this
  level because of the volume of
  enemies. So, use the standard
  method and just go to town.

  Recommended Drone: Attack or
  Turret Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  level is extremely
  claustrophobic and flooded
  with some annoying enemies
  like Mutators and Gravity
  Wells. What I find is best to
  do is to position yourself in
  either the bottom right or
  left corner and keep your
  focus on attacking towards the
  middle. Enemies will spawn in
  these corners so you need to
  watch for them and most of the
  time when they do is when I
  decide to make a break for the
  other side.

  Switching sides periodically
  will keep the enemies hung up
  in the middle and attack in
  this fashion seems to be
  easisest. This is why I
  recommend bringing the attack
  Drone in with you. It will
  double your firepower on the
  mass and although the Defense
  Drone is great, with my back
  to a wall it doesn't do me
  much good shooting the wall.
  The Turret can be of help to
  if it positions itself in the
  middle and starts taking
  enemies out from there, but
  the down time when it's
  relocating makes me want to
  stray away from it a bit.

  Essentially your going to want
  to treat this level like its
  an Asteroid level because
  there are just a ridiculous
  amount of enemies in a small
  area. Keep a close eye out for
  the Gravity Wells that appear
  in the middle because they can
  fill up really fast here. When
  I see these appear is another
  time I make a break for the
  other side being sure to take
  it out on the way. Watch the
  Mutators to because they like
  to appear about 4 or 5 at a
  time and bunch up together.

  Stay focused on keeping the
  enemies in the middle and
  putting all your attack power
  on them. It's gonna be pretty
  crazy by the time you hit
  30,000,000.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or
  Attack Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  _STRATEGY__ Right when you
  spawn something like 30 Darts
  will spawn all around you,
  this can be overwhelming at
  first, but you've got like 2
  seconds of invincibility at
  the beginning of the level so
  pick the top or the bottom and
  move out of the middle of
  them.

  Now, this level likes to
  constantly spawn enemies like
  this. All the usuals to:
  Wanderers, Weavers, Spinners,
  Darts and Gravity Wells.
  Towards the Gold Medal point
  of the level you'll start
  getting the occasional Snake
  and a handful of Repulsor's.
  That's when it starts to get
  really annoying, but up to
  that point it's pretty
  manageable.

  You'll notice the 4 peaks in
  the layout of the level. For
  me, these were key to my
  survival. I often preach not
  to ever corner yourself, but
  in this level I find that
  there are so many enemies it
  often helps to corner yourself
  so you don't have to worry
  about them coming from the
  sides, however, enemies also
  like to spawn like mad in
  these peaks so you have to
  watch for that because you
  don't have much time to form
  an escape plan when they do.

  So, there were about 3 things
  I did while playing this
  level. First and foremost was
  the circle method. Going
  around in circles in the
  inside part of this level is
  the easiest way to stay alive
  and take care of the enemies.
  As usual with the Circle
  Method is that I recommend the
  defend Drone to help get your
  backside while circling
  around.

  This planet really doesn't
  have much down time though to
  take out the big mass you
  accumulate behind you, so when
  I get them all built up I like
  to take a break in one of the
  peaks and just shoot out
  towards the middle. This
  causes all the enemies to
  funnel right into my guns and
  makes them easy to take out.
  As I said before though, you
  need to keep a close eye for
  enemies spawning in your peak.

  When they spawn I just jet out
  straight through the middle
  and then start circling again,
  or I just jet back and forth
  between peaks for a short
  time.

  When the Repulsors start
  coming out though you're
  probably going to want to back
  off the peak strategy because
  when there are 3 or 4 of them
  and they find your peak you
  are literally left with no
  where to run and it's either
  going to cost you a life, or a
  bomb.

  Recommended Drone: Sweep
  Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  _STRATEGY__ This is a pretty
  low key level really, decent
  amount of time between spawns
  and then an increasing amount
  of Generators as the level
  goes on. As you can see by the
  layout the level is kind of
  set up like a ring so we'll
  want to keep with a circling
  strategy and a Drone like
  sweep that is going to help
  protect us when things get
  close.

  Lots of Darts, Spinners and
  Weavers here. The Weavers can
  be really annoying because
  they'll get themselves on one
  side of the middle blockades
  and when you get around to
  them they'll jump to the other
  side. This level seems like it
  often waits for everything to
  be gone before it spawns more
  so situations like this can
  make it feel really slow.

  But keep with the circle
  method around the outside
  ring, stay out of the middle
  as much as possible because
  with multiple Generators out
  it's really easy to get
  ambushed from all sides when
  you get in there.

  _STRATEGY__ This is a pretty
  fun level and it ramps up the
  difficulty pretty fast. At the
  beginning you'll get a lot of
  spawns from Darts and Weavers,
  but not to far in a Mine Layer
  will appear and everything
  will change.

  Now, if you look at the
  explanation of the Mine Layer
  enemies in the Enemies Section
  ( [#ENEMI] ) I've had some
  contributions that give us
  some great Mine Layer strategy
  information. As the level goes
  on more Mine Layers will
  appear which gives us even
  more oppurtunity for big
  points.

  Alright, so basically here's
  how we want to look at this
  level. The Drone you choose to
  bring here isn't of as much
  importance because we are
  really going to be using the
  Mine Layers to gather points.
  As enemies spawn you are going
  to want to be doing a bit of
  circling so that they collect
  behind you, then lead them
  right over some mines (you'll
  need to set the first one off)
  and let the points flow in. If
  you read the Mine Layer
  section this will make more
  sense to you than if you
  didn't, but everything is
  written there so I'm not going
  to rewrite it all here.

  Now, what we need to watch out
  for are the Repulsor's that
  begin appearing up near 20k.
  You'll have to take care of
  them just like you do
  Repulsor's any other time,
  there's not a different
  strategy for this level, but
  I'm giving you a warning now
  that they can be quite
  obnoxious when 4 or 5 start
  appearing at the same time in
  the clutter.

  This level is seriously all
  about the mine layers so use
  them to your advantage.

  Recommended Drone: Attack or
  Defend Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is an interesting level as I
  don't beleive we've ever dealt
  with Wormholes up to this
  point. The Wormholes act just
  as they should be definition
  though in that going in one
  sends you out the other. In
  this level thats a good thing
  because the middle section is
  not much fun to navigate
  through. As you can see in the
  layout there are plenty of
  boxes there that make it like
  trying to get through a little
  maze.

  I recommend bringing in the
  attack Drone to this level
  because lots of Asteroids like
  to appear. They don't spawn
  super quick, but if you spend
  to much time on one half of
  the level you're likely to go
  to the other side and find 4
  or 5 Asteroids waiting for
  you. Most of the time they are
  just Wanderers which aren't a
  big deal, but you want to try
  and spread your attack over
  both halves of the level so
  one side doesn't get to backed
  up.

  Be aware that enemies can go
  through the Wormhole as well
  so hanging out to close to it
  may not be very wise and you
  may get suprised. Enemies will
  not purposefully use it
  though, most of the time they
  will try and traverse through
  the middle area so you can use
  the Wormhole for escape when
  you need to.

  Not to far in the level Snakes
  and Repulsor's start to appear
  which can be decently annoying
  with all of the Asteroids
  around, but you'll need to
  take care of them same as
  always. This is where the
  Defend Drone would probably be
  of more help. However, I get
  more concerned with getting
  overwhelmed by the Asteroids
  than a few Repulsor's. If all
  else fails you've always got
  some bombs.

  One final note is that when
  you go through a Wormhole
  you'll have the temporary
  invincibility you get when you
  start a level so use that to
  your advantage if you get
  cornered.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  planet isn't to bad, the main
  challenge is trying to not get
  stuck behind the flippers.
  What I actually did though was
  make it a point to get in
  there way at the very
  beginning of the level and I
  actually got them all pushed
  up into the top quadrent of
  the level and then I just did
  U patterns (instead of
  circles) between the right,
  bottom and left quadrants.
  This gave me a pretty easy
  time.

  I recommend the sweep Drone
  because of the flippers, when
  you get stuck behind them it
  just may be your saving grace.
  But for the most part you've
  got a lot of standard enemies
  at a pretty slow, but constant
  flow so this level didn't
  boast much trouble or much to
  worry about.

  the easier single life levels
  here actually. There are
  constant Meteor Showers to
  watch out for, but it's pretty
  much all Darts as far as other
  enemies go. Bring in the
  Defend Drone to help take care
  of the Meteor Showers when you
  need to take
care of enemies and vice versa.

  There are two blockades in the
  level, but you actually have a
  pretty decent amount of space
  to move around. Same rule
  stands as with other Meteor
  Shower levels. Try and always
  be facing into the shower and
  it'll never bother you. Just
  watch out for other enemies as
  you do it, but there aren't to
  many to bother you on this

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o Black
  Hole levels all seem the same
  to me and all seem pretty
  boring. You can't really do
  much of anything because of
  the pull from the Black Hole
  so I choose to just hang out
  on the bottom and face
  "upstream" or against the pull
  from the Black Hole so that
  the enemies are always coming
  to me and not from behind.
  With this one in perticular if
  you just sit kinda under the
  left blocade and shoot up the
  left side at an angle nothing
  will ever get to you from that
  side, but you do have to watch
  things coming down on top of
  you (the Neutrons and Mayflys
  especially).

  To me though there's nothing
  more to it, so if you have a
  better idea, by all means,
  send it my way.

  enemies here to hunt you down.
  Spinners, Weavers, Gravity
  Wells, Mutators, Generaters,
  Wanderers, Snakes and worst of

  are what always do me in.
  Circle Method applies, but
  that's really the best advice

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is a pretty hard level because
  it's pretty hectic and there
  really isn't much room to move
  around, especially when trying
  to avoid the Tiny Spinners and
  Repulsors. I want to recommend
  the Circle Method, but the
  spawns like to come from all 4
  corners so it really isn't a
  very easy method to carry out
  here.

  The reason I recommend the
  Attack or Defend drone is
  because of these crazy spawns.
  It's up to you whether you
  want to put your focus on
  doubling the attack where your
  focused or trying to attack to
  the front and back at the same
  time. I'd say that both are
  equally helpful, but either
  way this stage is going to be
  difficult.

  About the time of the Silver
  medal a lot of Repulsor's
  start coming out just as the
  last few levels have done.
  This is really annoying with
  all the Tiny Spinners you'll
  have driving you crazy from
  all the Spinners you'll be
  defeating.

  I didn't have a ton of luck
  and it took me a few tries to
  even get up to the Silver
  Medal, but here's what I ended
  up doing. I took in the Attack
  Drone personally right off the
  bat jumped to the bottom while
  I was invincible and then
  started clearing out the
  Darts. From here I hung out
  towards the middle and when
  the bunches of enemies would
  spawn I would pick one set of
  them and drive straight
  through them, then drive my
  way to the opposite corner and
  then try and get back to the
  middle if
 I could to repeat the process.

  When the Repulsor's started
  coming out I tried not to
  focus on them and keep up the
  same strategy so when I
  started driving back to the
  other side they would all be
  behind me and I could take
  them out in a quick sweep.
  Hopefully that helps you out a
  bit, this stage won't be easy
  though.

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  planet has a lot more room
  than the last one which makes
  it a lot easier to navigate
  around, however, it is
  actually very similar in
  design. It's got 8 "pockets"
  that give it it's cog shape
  and you are going to want to
  stay out of these for the same
  reason I've always preached to
  stay out of areas like this.

  This planet has plenty of room
  for you to use the circle
  method to gather enemies and
  let the Defend Drone
  annihilate or you can
  annihilate yourself. Now, I'm
  going to go back on what I
  just said and tell you that
  you may want to dip in one of
  the cog peaks to get in line
  with the mass following you
  (if you are circling) and then
  head straight through them to
  take them out. But I still
  stand firmly on the fact that
  you shouldn't hang out in
  those areas.

  With the Defend drone at your
  back though you should have a
  pretty easy time. I didn't do
  anything out of the ordinary
  on this planet or else I'd
  write about it to let you
  know, but I over doubled the
  Gold Medal just circling
  around and taking care of
  things as they come. At this
  point you should be pretty
  good friends with your Defend
  drone and be able to really
  work it to your advantage.

  screams Circle Method and you
  can trust me that it won't let
  you down. There are no
  Repulsor's to worry about
  here, just a slew or standard
  type enemies. You'll want to
  watch for Gravity Wells and
  Generators because those can
  both cause problems. But
  really the majority of your
  concern is going to be on the
  Mutators and Cell Masses.

  As you circle around don't let
  the Cell Masses build because
  the Mutaters can make a real
  mess if they get a hold of
  them. Also, because there
  isn't a ton of extra space
  around what I like to do when
  a mass of enemies builds up
  behind me is just switch the
  direction that I'm circling in
  and it makes it real easy to
  take them out.

  The other little trick I like
  to pull here is to do a mini-
  circle around one of the
  middle boundries when some
  enemies or Cell masses get
  stuck inside of there. Circle,
  circle, circle and focus on
  taking out the Generators as
  quickly as possible and you
  should be fine here.

  has to much stuff to draw out,
  so just to know
    offhand that it's got A LOT
    of boundries to avoid.
  Recommended Drone: Sweep
  Starting Lives: 3
  Initial Bombs: 0

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o There
  isn't much breathing room in
  this level, but there are
  plenty of enemies to push you
  around including Gravity
  Wells. As usual with tight
  levels bring in the Sweep to
  help attack around edges. With
  most I also recommend staying
  out of the middle, but so many
  enemies build up there that
  you probably won't have much
  of a choice but to get in
  there and clean those areas
  out.

  Almost all the enemies spawn
  somewhere in the middle,
  however you'll get some out of
  the corners and sides as well
  so be aware you don't let them
  spawn on top of you.
  Generators like to appear in
  the middle to so if you start
  getting a ton of enemies wave
  after wave you may want to
  take a look for one of those
  to take out.

  Not to far into the level
  you'll also start getting some
  crazy tight Meteor Showers.
  Literally with no space
  between the Meteors. Don't be
  afraid, because they don't
  last for long and you should
  be able to just to hang out by
  the side until they are done
  or completely avoid it because
  they don't normally take up
  the whole screen.

  Main strategy I like to go for
  is use the open area as
  alleys. The enemies have to
  filter themselves through them
  to get to you so use this to
  your advantage. Hang out
  looking down one of the
  openings firing shots into it
  and as the enemies make their
  way to it they'll just get
  blown up by their shots.

  If you hang out by one of the
  angled ones on the top or
  bottom then enemies will
  filter down both sides and you
  can essentially kill them
  twice as fast. If you get a
  little behind and they start
  getting to close just back off
  to one of the sides and take
  care of them or relocate to
  another side. If you brought
  Sweep with you you'll also be
  in luck because as enemies get
  close (even if they are behind
  a boundry) it'll take care of
  them.

  So, use all these boundries to
  your advantage and let the
  enemies filter in to where you
  want them to be. When you get
  Generators in the middle areas
  just get in there a little bit
  and take them out then retreat
  back to the safer zones.

  Alright, as 1 life level's
  always are, this 1 is hard for
  me. But here's what happens.
  The level starts off with
  Mayflys and then Meteor
  Showers come. You get an
  occasional Grunt, but for the
  most part that is all you
  really have to deal with.
  However, a little ways in you
  actually start getting Meteor
  Shower's from opposite sides
  at the same time. This is the
  point where it starts getting
  really tricky because you have
  to dodge both showers at the
  same time while avoiding the
  Teeny Tiny Mayflys.

  Defend is pretty much
  indisposable here because
  while you attack the Meteor
  showers on one side it will
  take care of the one on the
  other side. Just watch the
  Mayflys because their small
  size can make them a little
  harder to target than
  something like a Grunt or
  Wanderer. But really there
  aren't many tricks to this
  planet.

  Layout: Big square with lots
  of funky boundries Recommended
  Drone: Defend or Attack
  Starting Lives: 3 Initial
  Bombs: 3

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  levels got some crazy
  boundries in it, but really
  it's just a big square so
  treat it like one. This level
  feels so big due to all of the
  weird boundries that I always
  felt like I had plenty of
  space to move around and that
  the enemies were few and far
  between (minus the Generator
  spawns).

  So, I basically went with the
  method of circling around the
  outside edge and then whenever
  the middle got full or the
  outside got empty I went
  through one of the middle
  paths to take out those
  enemies.

  Often Generators will spawn on
  the sides, normally 2 at a
  time so be sure to get over
  there and either feed points
  off the enemies they spawn or
  take them out. These are
  probably the biggest pain on
  this planet due to the
  boundries because it's easy to
  get cornered and if you get
  cornered while the Generators
  are spawning you can't kill
  them and won't be able to get
  out. The other problem that
  occurs is that you get trapped
  by the Tiny Spinners from
  destroying Generators spawning
  Spinners.

  As long as your careful though
  and use the boundries to hide
  behind and keep enemies out of
  your direct path you shouldn't
  have much trouble taking care
  of this planet.

  Recommended Drone: Defend or
  Sweep Starting Lives: 1
  Initial Bombs: 0

  o-| S-t-r-a-t-e-g-y |-o This
  is a small stage Neutron
  filled single life voyage. As
  with many of the stages like
  this the most difficult part
  is getting enough Geoms to get
  upgraded to the 3 shot burst.

  I'm torn between whether I do
  better with the Defend or the
  Sweep to be honest because
  most of teh time when I die is
  prevented by the Sweep taking
  care of enemies that are to
  close. But my general strategy
  with the Nuetrons since they
  move fast, but turn slow is to
  position myself in the middle
  and then when they start
  coming for me do a little "c"
  shape (to one side or the
  other) and keep shooting
  towards where I was to kind of
  take them out in my sweep.
  It's not perfect, but it works
  pretty well.

  I'm really quite bad at this
  stage so that's about the best
  I have to tell you. It takes
  concetration and dilligence so
  just keep practicing and you
  should get it.

  Another Asteroid level only
  this time it packs in quite a
  few Snakes and a handful of
  Repulsors along with the
  Asteroids. It's relatively
  small even compared to some of
  the other Asteroid levels, but
  the same rules apply. Keep the
  Asteroids shoved into the
  sides to keep them
  concentrated when they explode
  and spread your focus evenly
  over both sides so that one
  side doesn't fill up more than
  the other. Bring in the Attack
  drone so you can take
  everything out twice as fast
  and whenever extra enemies
  spawn take care of them then
  go back to the Asteroids.

  That's it in a nutshell, if
  you need more strategy than
  that look back to some of the
  earlier Asteroid levels
  because all the same rules
  apply.

First and foremost thanks to
anyone reading this guide
especially those of you who have
wandered down to this section to
read more about me. I love
playing games and I also love
making games. I haven't made any
official games yet, but I'm
working on it. I am a programmer
and I love working with
Microsoft's XNA, but I also love
doing web programming.

I run a website at
http://www.awesomeghost.com.
It's basically a blog site now
days. It's been through a lot of
changes and updates. I want to
get more tutorial type articles
posted up, mainly for XNA stuff,
but I like talking about games
and life to.

I don't have a lot of time to
make guides being as I am going
to school and also working on
making games and websites. Guide
writing is very time consuming
and there are a number of people
who write more in depth guides
than I do and get them posted a
lot quicker than I do so there's
really no point in me trying
most of the time. However,
Galaxies didn't have a guide
when I started this one (a full
guide that is) so I decided to
put some effort into one and
post it up.

It's a really fun game to play
and I'm getting close to have
Gold Medals on all planets so I
felt qualified enough to write
up some info about the game.
Hopefully some of you reading
this can contribute some great
strategies to really mold this
into a really awesome guide. I
don't think I have the best
strategies, but maybe I actually
know more than I realize.

If you'd like to give some
feedback or send a contribution
feel free to do so. You can
contact me at:
ahhsumx@gmail.com. Just make
sure you write something about
Geometry Wars in the title of
the email or I may delete it
without even looking at it.

For now, enjoy this guide, enjoy
this game, check out my site and
send me some awesome strategies
to post in here. Thanks!
