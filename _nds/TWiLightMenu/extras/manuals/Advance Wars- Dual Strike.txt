I dedicate this to my girlfriend
Jessica Thompson. She has been a
wonderful woman with me thus
far, and she continues to be an
astoundingly great human being.
She has always been supportive
of my gaming (not seeing it as
an evil necessity to put up with
like some others), so here's to
her, a beauty and my love!

Also, for Cougar, Howler, and
Koonce. I miss you, and I hope
you are living it up in the
afterlife as you did in this
world. You will always be in my
memories, and you will never be
forgotten.

1) With Sturm defeated and gone,
   it appeared that Black Hole
   might finally disappear into
   the wilds... at least for a
   while. However, under a new
   leader and with mostly new
   CO's, Black Hole has
   returned, this time aiming
   their mighty war machine upon
   the people of Omega Land!
   That does raise an
   interesting query though...
   how does Black Hole keep
   producing such massive
   armies? Especially after two
   straight disastrous defeats
   at the hands of the members
   of the Allied Nations (Orange
   Star, Blue Moon, Yellow
   Comet, and Green Earth)? Play
   on to find out what is going
   on, and enjoy what is a great
   expansion upon the AW
   universe!

--------------------------------
--------------------------------
--------------------------------

2) This section will give
   information on each type of
   unit, what their weaponry is
   and what units they can
   fight.

   The stats will be based on
   both units being at full
   power (both have full Hit
   Points), the Defensive
   Terrain being a value of 0,
   and this will not take into
   account CO bonuses/penalties
   on the attacks. It should be
   useful as a quick reference
   for offensive and defensive
   abilities of each unit type.
   Also note that any attack
   listed as 0% means that the
   unit type can not attack that
   unit type. Al so note that
   any defense listed as 0%
   means that the unit type can
   not be attacked by the unit
   listed.

These are the lighter foot
soldiers in your army. They are
only good for fighting other
Infantry and Mech units when it
comes to battling, but they are
also useful for expanding your
territory by capturing new
cities.

Cost : 3000 Movement Points : 2
(2 in mountains) Vision : 2
Primary Weapon : Bazooka (3
Rounds) Secondary Weapon:
Machine Gun

Mechs move slightly slower than
other foot soldier counterparts,
but this is due to their Primary
Weapon the Bazooka. They have 3
rounds of the tank missile ammo
before running dry, which means
they will use their secondary
weapon (Machine Gun) for all
battles. They are slightly more
powerful than Infantry with the
Machine Gun in battle, and they
can stand against Tanks and
Recon units fairly well.

These guys are essentially
Infantry with wheels. They have
high-powered Machine guns for
weapons, so they are ideal for
taking on foot soldiers. Add in
the fact that their vision is so
great (a real asset in Fog Of
War situations), and you have a
unique and useful unit. However,
these fellows can not capture
cities or traverse across non-
Road areas quickly, so be wary
of this when moving out with
them.

These treaded terrors are a
fairly good investment as they
can take down any flying units
Hit points super fast. They also
have great success against foot
soldiers and moderate success
against lighter armored
vehicles. They are susceptible
to explosive rounds though, so
be especially wary of the Tanks
in the game.

These are the weakest of the
Tank family, but they still deal
decent damage to other Tanks and
lightly armored units (like
Recon and Anti-Air units). The
secondary weapon (Machine Gun)
is fairly powerful (even better
than a Recon's), so turning it
loose on foot soldiers and even
lightly armored vehicles if you
have no more Cannon rounds. A
fairly cheap hard hitter that is
fairly susceptible to explosive
rounds.

sea vessels and Neotanks). The
secondary weapon (Machine Gun)
is fairly powerful (even better
than a Tank's), so turning it
loose on foot soldiers and even
lightly armored vehicles if you
have no more Cannon rounds. A
fairly expensive hard hitter
that is only susceptible to long

Neotanks are near the top of the

dealing incredible damage to
almost everything they fire on.
They also boast superior
movement range, making them fast
striking foes that can wield

MegaCannon (3 Rounds) Secondary
Weapon: Machine gun

An invention of Green Earth's
CO's, this monstrosity packs an
INCREDIBLE primary weapon in the
MegaCannon! It is capable of
hammering anything into a
smoking pile, and it also boasts
incredibly thick and durable
armor. However, due to the
massive size of the shells, only
3 MegaCannon rounds can be
stored in the tank's body, and
the massive armor makes the gas
hold in the vehicle very small,
meaning that though this tank is
powerful, it needs to be
supported constantly or it will
soon be running on fumes and
secondary machine gun fire. It
also lacks large moving range,
which is again due to the over-
armored nature of the vehicle.

This byproduct of Black Hole's
schemes is a slowly moving mess
that seems innocent enough...
until it gets up close. It has
the capability to absorb and
destroy ANY unit in one
movement, regardless of the
target unit type and how healthy
the Oozium may be. They also
boats great defense against
indirect attacks, meaning that
only close up attacks will be
able to dissipate the pooled

Weapon: None

This Black Hole invention can be
taken away by finding their
hidden base and wining the
battle there. Although
restricted to movement along
pipelines (meaning it is only
movable in a few levels) and
camping on factories, it is a
unique weapon that can only be
directly attacked from one space
as the enemy can not drive onto
the pipe. Much like Rockets it
can hit targets as far away as 5
spaces, but unlike Rockets it
can hit any target as close 2
spaces and it can also fire upon
any unit in the field, including
air units.

No weaponry here as the Lander
is intended solely for
transporting land units from one
shore to another. It can
transport up to two units at a
time, but it can only land on a
shore where there are Shallows
or at a Port (does not need to
be under your control).

Similar to the Lander in that it
can transfer two units at a
time, due to it's lighter power
it can only take Infantry or
Mech units (the same rules of
shore/ports as only pick-up and
drop-off spots apply). The real
draw of this unit though is that
it can repair damage to any unit
by 1 Hit Point immediately after
moving, making it an ideal unit
to mass produce to keep the war
machine healthy. Note that they
do not re0supply spent units
though.

A jack-of-all-trades on the sea,
this vessel is very adept at
bringing down Submarines (using
the Primary Weapon) and air
force units (really effective on
both Helicopter types and fair
against all three Plane types).
It can also carry up to two
Helicopters (both types) on its
deck at one time.

Subs can fire on naval units
only, and they do very poorly
against Cruisers while great
against other Subs and
Battleships. They will burn
either one unit of fuel (on the
surface) or five units of fuel
(submerged) at the beginning of
each turn. However, submerged
Subs can not be detected by
units unless they are right
beside the unit.

The Aircraft Carrier is a real
terror versus air units, ripping
them all down from the skies (if
they are within 3-8 spaces) with
their vaunted Missile attacks.
However, they also serve as a
landing pad for any air unit,
holding two at a time and they
will also re-supply any unit
that stays on board until the
next turn.

(except air units) within a

deliver devastating damage to

The "T" is for Transport, and
that is what this whirlybird
does for your forces. It can
carry one foot soldier at a time
and it can load/unload only when
it is over solid ground itself.
Useful for sneaking by the front
lines to snake a property or
even the Enemy Headquarters.

A real nice addition to your
armies, B Copters can use their
Missiles to fight armored foes
and they can use their Machine
Guns to take down other units.
They can really hurt Infantry,
Mech, B Copters, and Tanks or
lower in the armored units.
However, they are quite weak to
any Anti-Air units and they
should be used as support
attackers instead of being your
front line attackers. They do
not do well vs. Navy (except
Cruisers) and they can attack
Helicopters only in the air
(both kinds, but very well).

A versatile fighter, it is
capable of damaging all land,
sea, and air units, though it
has to engage them directly in
battle. They also boast the
great capability of being able
to cloak themselves, only being
vulnerable to attack from other
Stealths and Fighter units, but
is comes at the cost of burning
8 units of fuel (as opposed to
the traditional 5 units), so an
APC or a Carrier is a must for
this unit to have any longevity
on the battlefield.

Purely an air unit fighter,
these guys are made to stop
charging Helicopters in one
volley of Missiles, as well as
badly crippling other Fighters,
Stealths and Bombers. Expensive
to deploy, they can be taken
down but Anti-Air units and
Missiles fairly easily, so keep
an eye out for those units when
moving. Still a useful unit to
have, especially when the enemy
likes to bring the air units
after your forces repeatedly.

A devastating sight to any
ground unit that hears their jet
engines whine as it approaches,
these behemoths can only be
fired on by a select few units
as they bring their hard hitting
payload. Anti-Air and Missiles
are the only ground units that
can fire on them, Cruisers are
on the only sea units to fire on
them, and Fighters as well as
Stealths are the only air units
to fire on them. However,
Bombers are an excellent way to
remove heavily armored land
units and they are worth the
price that they boast.

Another Black Hole creation that
must have the pans stolen from a
lab map, this monster will not
stay in the air long, and after
one attack it will no longer
exist. However, when it does
attack it will remove FIVE Hit
Points from every unit within
range (friend or foe), though it
can not destroy any unit (if
they have five or less Hit
Points, then that unit will be
reduced to 1 Hit Point). The
only units that can destroy a
Black Bomb before it attacks are
as follows: Anti-Air, Missiles,
Piperunner, Cruiser, Carrier,
Stealth, and Fighter. Although
they are expensive to deploy, a
well utilized and placed strike
can knock an entire strike force
of an army into disarray, or
even open a portion of the enemy
defenses to a break through
opportunity.

3) This section will give you
   the heads up on how to use
   the terrain to your advantage
   when battling the opposition.


         o------------o
         | Land Types |
         o------------o

           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Road ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 0

Since there is no cover when
using the road, your units are
extremely vulnerable to damage.
However, it is the best movement
place for wheeled vehicles.


          ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Plains ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 1

With minimal cover, your troops
will still be rather open to
being hit hard by the
opposition. Wheeled vehicles
will use two movement points per
Plain crossed.


          ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Forest ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 2

The trees afford the unit
residing within some coverage
from fire. Wheeled vehicles use
3 movement points through these
woods.


           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ City ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a City and still
take very little damage. If the
City is controlled by that unit,
at the start of their next turn
they will be re-supplied and
have up to 2 Hit Points
recovered if they are damaged.


           ~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Lab ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a City and still
take very little damage.


           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Base ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a Base and still
take very little damage. If the
Base is controlled by that unit,
at the start of their next turn
they will be re-supplied and
have up to 2 Hit Points
recovered if they are damaged
(provided the unit is a ground
unit). Also, if the Base is
unoccupied by an unit, you can
purchase a new ground unit to
appear there.


         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       ~~~~ Airport ~~~~
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding an Airport and
still take very little damage.
If the Airport is controlled by
that unit, at the start of their
next turn they will be re-
supplied and have up to 2 Hit
Points recovered if they are
damaged (provided the unit is an
air unit). Also, if the Airport
is unoccupied by a unit, you can
purchase a new air unit to
appear there.


           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Port ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a Port and still
take very little damage. If the
Port is controlled by that unit,
at the start of their next turn
they will be re-supplied and
have up to 2 Hit Points
recovered if they are damaged
(provided the unit is a water
unit). Also, if the Airport is
unoccupied by an unit, you can
purchase a new air unit to
appear there.


           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Silo ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a Silo and still
take very little damage. A great
attacking building, it can be
fired (only one time though) by
an Infantry or a Mech. They have
unlimited range and a large
splash damage area, but both
sides in the conflict can be
hurt by it.


          ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Tower ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 3

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a Tower and still
take very little damage. These
new building in the Advance Wars
universe allow for a country to
get a +10% Offense boost for
every one of these that they
have in their possession, but
they can not repair or resupply
any units.


       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     ~~~~ Headquarters ~~~~
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 4

A unit can take a good beating
while holding Headquarters and
still take very little damage.
This building is the nerve
centre of each army, and if it
is captured, the side that lost
their Headquarters loses the
battle. If the Headquarters is
controlled by that unit, at the
start of their next turn they
will be re-supplied and have up
to 2 Hit Points recovered if
they are damaged.


         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       ~~~~ Mountain ~~~~
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 4

A unit can take a good beating
while holding a Mountain and
still take very little damage.
Only Infantry and Mech units may
enter mountains, giving them the
upper hand in battles with
stronger foes. They also
experience increased vision
during Fog Of War maps from
these locales.


        o-------------o
        | Water Types |
        o-------------o

          ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Shoal ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 0

A unique land type in that both
land and water units can set
foot on. No cover to be found,
so maximum damage will be taken
when in a fight.


           ~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Sea ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 0

Sea going vessels only here,
with no cover what so ever.
Units here are completely open
to damage.


           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Reef ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Defense Rating: 1

The lone place on the sea where
a unit can have some protection
from attack, albeit a very small
amount of protection.

4) This section will give
   statistics and strategies to
   get through each map in the
   game. This includes the
   hidden lab areas as well,
   which will be placed after
   the map they are discovered
   in.


         o------------o
         | Mission 01 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Jake's Trial
Suggested CO: Jake
Enemy CO    : Rachel
Difficulty  : 1/10

On Day One send the Tank and
Mech after the nearby enemy Tank
to remove it from the
battlefield, followed by moving
the Infantry up to the closest
building to the Mech/Tank strike
force.

Day Two will see an enemy
Infantry come close enough for
the Mech and Infantry to double
team said enemy Infantry, while
the Tank rolls out to cut some
Hit Points out of the other
enemy Infantry.

Day Three will bring the simple
job of mopping up the remains of
the enemy force to grab the
victory!


         o------------o
         | Mission 02 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: The New Black
Suggested CO: Jake
Enemy CO    : Jugger
Difficulty  : 1/10

Day One begins with the Tank
rolling up the road, followed by
loading the weakened Infantry
into the APC before moving up
the road past the Tank, dropping
the Infantry. After this, fire
at the enemy with the Artillery
on the right while the Artillery
on the left moves to the right
one space.

Day Two Continue to bring the
Tank and APC up the road,
rushing towards the enemy ranks,
while the Artillery should lay
some punishment upon the hapless
foes.

Day Three will be more of the
same, as the Artillery should
lay the boots to the enemy
Tanks, and the Tank/APC convoy
continues along the northward
path.

Day Four has the Tank finishing
off the remaining enemy Tank,
ending the mission!


         o------------o
         | Mission 03 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Max Attacks
Suggested CO: Max
Enemy CO    : Lash
Difficulty  : 2/10

Day One will have all the B
Copters fly north to try and
outrace the strange enemy unit,
though it will be impossible for
a lot of the Copters to get away
cleanly (as you will soon see).
In the mean time, use an APC and
a Mech to block up the bridge
against the incoming enemy land
units.

Day Two should begin by
combining the hurt B Copters
(combining them will lessen the
amount of your units in the
battle, BUT it will make them
fight at full strength, which is
a fair enough compromise),
moving the one healthy B Copter
to the very front of the unit
lines you began to assemble last
turn. Send the Mech onto the T
Copter, and send the T Copter
southwards, moving towards the
enemy Headquarters.

Day Three will begin with the
fully strengthened B Copters
sending their Missile payloads
down into the enemy Tanks and Md
Tanks. After that the Artillery
should be moved as close to the
front of the lines without being
exposed, remembering after that
to move the T Copter further
towards the intended target of
the enemy Headquarters.

Day Four will further the
attacks upon the enemy rolling
forces, making them too weak to
really threaten your units. The
T Copter should be able to reach
land, dropping off the Mech near
the enemy Headquarters.

Day Five onwards will be
dictated by your preferred style
of play. If you are a fan of
capturing the enemy
Headquarters, then go get it
while pounding the enemy troops
that remain. The alternative to
this is to obliterate the enemy
troops to complete the battle,
though it may be wise to begin
the capturing at the same time,
as the enemy can sometimes
scatter, wasting an extra turn
on Max, so taking the HQ instead
of spending the extra turn may
be more desirable for scoring
purposes.


         o------------o
         | Mission 04 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Reclaim The Skies
Suggested CO: Rachel
Enemy CO    : Jugger
Difficulty  : 1/10

The mission has a 30 minute real
time limit, so best not dawdle!
Actually, this mission is
absolutely easy, so the time
limit will turn out to be a
complete non-factor.

On Day one use the Missiles unit
on the B Copter, destroying it
completely, followed by
hammering the Tank with the
Rockets. Use the Anti-Air units
on the Bomber and Fighter,
finally finishing the initial
push by getting your Tank to
crash into the enemy Tank.

Day Two is simply finished by
using your units to destroy the
remaining enemy forces, claiming
the victory!


         o------------o
         | Mission 05 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Neverending War
Suggested CO: Jake
Enemy CO    : Koal
Difficulty  : 2/10

At this point in the game,
selection of your CO for most
maps are possible. Try to figure
out which CO would work best on
a particular map, though the
suggested CO is the one that
made it the easiest map possible
(from here on out). When ready,
choose deploy from the menu to
begin the battle!

On Day One purchase an Infantry
unit in the south and a Mech in
the north, also using current
Mechs to draw the enemy nearer
to your unit's positions.

Day Two begins with a Tank
purchase in the north, followed
by beginning a capture of a City
in the south. Also fire off a
round at the enemy Tank in the
south to soften it up.

Day Three begins with an
Artillery purchase in the north
after moving the Tank bought on
the previous turn southward,
blocking the bridge so the enemy
can not cross. In the south buy
a Mech before ending the turn.

Day Four to Day Six will see
things pick up in pace, so these
movements will take place over
the three day period. Use the
APC in the north to draw the
enemy Md Tank towards your
troops (position the APC on the
Orange Star city), where the
Tank/Artillery/Mechs force can
knock the Md Tank into the scrap
heap. Claim the factory in the
south, rolling Tanks out the
door as soon as possible, all
the while producing more Tanks
in the north to reinforce the
weakened troops already in
combat.

Day Seven onwards will consist
of whittling down and destroying
enemy strength, using a two-
pronged attack to clear the area
of Black Hole units.


         o------------o
         | Mission 06 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: The Ocean Blue
Suggested CO: Colin
Enemy CO    : Lash
Difficulty  : 2/10

On Day One use the Battleship
and nearby Rocket on the enemy
Cruiser, sending it down to the
briny deep, followed by sending
the Submarine to the northwest,
submerging it to avoid enemy
Battleship fire after the turn
ends. Speaking of that
Battleship, move the nearby B
Copter out to damage the massive
superstructure, hit the enemy
Sub with a Cruiser salvo (this
means it will be a target for
the Battleship after the turn,
but it will not be destroyed),
and load the APC with an
Infantry before placing the APC
and a Tank on the Lander, moving
towards the middle island.

Day Two will begin with the
enemy Sub being completely
destroyed and the enemy
Battleship receiving some more
damage from sea units, followed
by landing the APC and Tank with
the Lander, setting up the
battle with ground forces in the
vicinity.

Day Three onwards will be your
typical mop up operation,
pounding the remaining units
with all available troops,
taking the field and the
victory!


         o------------o
         | Mission 07 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Fog Rolls In
Suggested CO: Jake or Rachel
Enemy CO    : Koal
Difficulty  : 3/10

This is the first instance of
Fog Of War to be found in the
game, so get ready for some
hidden units, hard to peer into
Woods and Reef sections of the
map.

Day One begins the battle by
sending the Infantry onto the
nearby mountains to get a larger
view of the area, spotting an
Artillery. Destroy the Artillery
while advancing the remaining
troops (using Woods for cover as
much as humanly possible).

On Day Two an enemy Recon and a
Tank should be destroyed and
damaged respectively, also
remembering to advance the
troops while getting a Recon
into some Woods further along to
use it as a hidden observer to
spot incoming enemies.

Day Three onwards will consist
of a somewhat cautious approach,
leapfrogging from cover to
cover, tag teaming all opponents
who would get in your way. The
enemy may try to sneak an
Infantry past your troops in an
APC (with the intention of
taking your HQ), so keep an eye
out for it to hammer it.
Finally, the enemy HQ houses a
Tank and an Artillery unit is
positioned in the nearby Woods,
so come at them with a B-Copter,
Anti-Air, and Tank, overwhelming
them quickly, going for the
total destruction route of
victory, or to just clear the
way for an Infantry to take the
Headquarters to end the map.

Mission Name: Tag Battle
Suggested CO: Max
Enemy CO    : Lash & Jugger
Difficulty  : 2/10

The enemy will be trying out the
Tag Battle style of the game
(which will soon become
commonplace), so the goal is to
disable their troops to the
point that their counter-attack
with the Tag Power will be
minimal at best.

On Day One buy two Infantry.

On Days Two to Four buy two more
Infantry and capture the nearby
buildings, also making sure to
get two Tanks prepped and roll
them out, sending them to smash
up the Black Hole Piperunner.
Finally, have an APC transport
Infantry towards the Airport,
taking them to get the property
under control.

Days Five to Seven concentrates
on finishing off the Piperunner
and consolidating all the
northern properties. As for new
units, concentrate on more
Tanks, an Artillery, and an
Anti-Air unit, advancing
southward to engage the enemy,
keeping them contained to the
lower half of the map.

Day Eight onwards will focus on
taking out the enemy troops,
lowering their numbers and
strength, forcing the enemy to
use their Tag Attack with too
few troops to inflict any severe
damage. After the attack, bring
in Tanks, Artillery, B Copters,
and a Bomber, forcing the Black
Hole units to be driven under in
very short order.

Mission Name: Victory Or Death!
Suggested CO: Jake & Rachel OR
Colin & Sasha Enemy CO : Koal &
Lash Difficulty : 3/10

Start off by choosing two CO's,
with the first CO selected
battling on the main front in
the conventional fashion, while
the second CO selected will
fight on the secondary front.
The secondary front is a battle
of various units, though
Fighters/Bombers can be sent to
help, and the CO that wins will
get to join his/her partner on
the main front, giving a decided
advantage to said force, as they
can make use of the Tag Power
capability.

Day One and Day Two will begin
with the Fighters on the main
front being sent to the second
front, strengthening the forces
there for the fight to come.
While this is being done, take
the Factory and Airport and that
lie nearby, ignoring the factory
in the middle of the map, as the
Black Fortress above will bomb
any troops that are created
there.

Day Three to Day Six will see
one more Fighter (buy from the
Airport) and a Bomber (since the
enemy Fighters will be destroyed
by now), both of which can
assist with the final
destruction of the Black
Fortress Minicannons, taking it
out of commission and ending the
second front battle (bringing
the second CO to the main
front). As for the main front,
use Anti-Airs and B-Copters to
hammer the incoming enemy
B-Copters while massing all
other troops just outside the
range of the bombs from above,
waiting for the disabling of the
fortress. The range to stay
clear of the blasts are three
spaces.

Day Seven onwards will have the
remaining units from the second
front greatly increase the Star
Power of both CO's, setting up
an ideal situation where a Tag
Power can be used, so use it to
push through the center of the
map, leading the way with Tanks,
hammering on the enemy. After
weakening the air defenses,
bring in B-Copters and Bombers,
loosing them upon the hapless
foes on the ground, closing the
net of units closer and closer
upon the Black Crystal,
shattering it to take the field
and the victory!

Difficulty  : 3/10

Day One to Day Three will have
the Sub in the water submerge,
focusing it's efforts upon the
enemy Battleship, scuttling the
behemoth to the deep. On land
the battle is best served in
your favour by pushing across
the bridge, bringing the fight
to the foe, focusing upon the
Tanks and Anti-Airs mainly,
followed by creaming the
Artillery and foot units.

Day Four to Day Six will begin
with the focus of grabbing the
Neutral City across the bridge,
as it holds the map to the plans
for the Black Boat unit (this
unlocks the next mission, so be
sure to do this action).
Meanwhile, the remaining units
will need to mop up as many foes
as possible, keeping the enemy
occupied so the Lander can get
an Infantry to the enemy
Headquarters, capturing it to
end the threat in this area!

Mission Name: The Long March
Suggested CO: Jake & Rachel (OS)
/ Colin & Sasha (BM) Enemy CO :
Jugger & Koal Difficulty : 3/10

Day One to Day Three for Orange
Star should use indirects to
shred the Black Hole foes across
the water, also making sure to
use the Tanks to stem the
charging enemy Tanks, allowing
for the indirects to rip them
up. Blue Moon forces will need
to smash up the Black Hole naval
forces as their primary mission,
followed by turning attention to
the heavy ground forces to
assist the forces of Orange
Star. Colin and Sasha should
switch positions every turn,
buying new units with Colin
while Sasha collects extra cash
on the off turns.

Day Four to Day Six will have an
enemy Tag Power lay into the
Orange Star troops, so take the
hit and send a Recon with an
Infantry laden APC northward,
hopping from forest to forest
cover, attempting to get close
to the Lab in the north. To
facilitate this effort, divert
some of the southern forces
northward after the Black Hole
foes begin to get taken out in
the south, as the overwhelming
force is not necessary at that
point.

Continue to pound on the foes on
both fronts, getting the
Infantry close enough to the Lab
to capture it, stealing the
Black Boat plans and ending the
mission!

Mission Name: Lightning Strikes
Suggested CO: Jake & Max
Enemy CO    : Grimm & Sensei
Difficulty  : 3/10

Max is the perfect choice for
the second front, as his direct
firepower capabilities will
cancel out the B-Copter and Mech
advantages that Sensei has.

The first step is to turn the
Auto CO off, as you can fight
FAR better than any strategy
setting selected for the second
front. This is very important to
help remove the second front,
adding your CO to the main
front, making Tag Power's
available for use.

Day One to Day Five on the main
front will concentrate on taking
the City near the river, leaving
the Infantry there to fight the
foes that will try to cross
while an APC (with an Infantry)
and a Recon go north to get onto
the center island. These two
will begin the process of
holding off Grimm's troops while
the Infantry takes the Factory,
also creating and sending two
more Anti-Airs to the second
front (the starting Anti-Air
should be sent there on the
first turn). On the second front
Max should work on destroying
the Mechs when possible, as they
can do far more damage to the
Anti-Air units (the best weapon
against Sensei's forces), but
attacking the B-Copters is also
acceptable. Use the non-air
killing units in your possession
to bait and distract the Mechs,
buying the time necessary for
the Anti-Airs to get into attack
position.

Day Six to Day Ten begin with
the capture of the Airport at
the outset, creating a decided
advantage for your forces as
B-Copters will be able to hammer
the majority of the early troops
that Grimm bought. This is also
a choice time to make use of the
Missile Silos that lie on the
island, slamming them into the
enemy forces looking to attack
across the river, weakening them
enough that your Infantry forces
(buy replacements in the south
as needed) can smack them back
with relative ease. Finally, the
second front should consist of
an organized mop-up mission,
with max putting an end to
Sensei, joining Jake on the main
front.

Day Eleven onwards will consist
of Tanks, B Copters, and a
Bomber hammering into Grimm,
using a Tag Power to remove the
majority of his units, thus
rendering his Co Power/Super CO
Power essentially useless. It is
possible to take the
Headquarters as well, but it is
far more fun to pound his troops
relentlessly after he started
with the initial advantage.

3/10

Com Towers will enable units to
have a slight boost in firepower
(10% over the usual for each
unit MULTIPLIED by the amount
possessed, so owning 3 is a 30%
boost for instance), and this
map will introduce them to your
forces.

Day One to Day Seven will have
the northern forces exterminate
the Black Hole forces found
there, followed by moving
Infantry across the shoals to
the far side of the water,
claiming the Factory (build
units from here to assist in the
south) as well as the City, as
it holds the map to the Black
Bomb Lab area (the next mission
is only playable by taking this
City, so hop to it). The
southern forces will need to
start out by taking the Airport,
making use of Tanks and B
Copters to hurt the Black Hole
forces, all the while expanding
outwards to take more property.

Day Eight onwards will consist
of more of the same, bringing
the northern troops to the
south, squeezing a vice upon the
Black Hole forces, crushing them
in a display of awesome power.
Make sure to keep taking
properties, increasing the
firepower of all units via the
Com Towers.

Enemy CO    : Lash
Difficulty  : 2/10

A rather simple matter of choice
here, as Sensei can lead the way
early, leaving it to Grimm to
pound the enemy after a few
Days.

Day One to Day Four will consist
of Sensei having a B Copter free
the Black Bombs on the east side
of the map, while an APC takes a
Mech and an Infantry towards the
Com Towers, taking them to
increase the force's firepower.
An Md Tank and a Rocket should
free the other set of Black
Bombs, followed by massing the
troops by this containment area
(between it and the water).

Day Five to Day Seven will being
with a series of Black Bomb
detonations, using about half of
them, forcing the foe to combine
their forces into one another
(they do this to get full
strength units once again),
followed by a second round of
Black Bomb smashings on the next
turn. At this point the main
forces in your control should
rush northward, smacking the
weakened units to remove as many
from play as possible. Also, as
a precaution, make sure that an
Infantry is sent to the Airport,
taking it to make sure that the
Black Hole can not start using
it to pump out new units.

Day Eight onwards will have any
Powers being used, pushing right
to the top of the area, killing
all foes.

Day One to Day Three will have
the Orange Star forces (led by
Colin) move their Tanks to the
south to bottle up the exit from
the mountains, purchasing more
Tanks to assist in this
endeavour. In the mean time, all
the Infantry should be fanning
out and taking the Cities/Com
Towers that it can, gaining
firepower bonuses and funding in
the process. Blue Moon troops
will have to use their long
range capabilities to weaken up
the Megatank and large escort
Tanks it has, positioning the
Mechs on Mountains where treaded
troops can not attack them, but
gives them (and the indirect
units) a better look at the
battlefield. Have Sasha lead the
way here, using her Market Crash
power to bring the enemy back
from the brink of a Tag Power
attack.

Day Four onwards will have Max
leading the way for Orange Star,
using his direct firepower
skills to knock out the
Megatank. The Blue Moon will
need to support the Orange Star
efforts from afar while they
wait for a chance to send their
Mechs in over the mountains,
taking the headquarters to end
the battle.

Mission Name: Snow Hunters
Suggested CO: Max & Javier
Enemy CO    : Hawke
Difficulty  : 4/10

Day One to Day Seven opens with
the decision of whether to blast
open the pipe seams to stall the
progress of the Piperunners, or
to let the, slide along, as the
blown pipe seams will allow the
main force of Black Hole direct
access to your trapped units.
The best option is to allow the
Piperunners free reign, as they
will soon slide into range of
your Tanks, making their days
numbered. The indirect units
will need to keep the enemy
Infantry from claiming the
Factories on the opposite side
of the pipes, as that would
prove disastrous to the battle
(if no Infantry to shoot, peg
off enemy Tanks and Artillery).
The Missiles and Anti-Air should
be re-routed to the southwest,
lining up to face the incoming
B-Copter and Bomber barrage,
followed by moving an APC with
foot soldiers to go take the
Seaport and Com Tower. Finally,
use the Lander to send an
Infantry to the island in the
southeast AFTER the Piperunners
have moved northwards in pursuit
of your troops. By taking the
Cities here, the map to the
Piperunner Lab location will be
secured, creating the
opportunity to play the next
level.

Day Eight onwards will focus on
smashing the remaining foes,
purchasing a Battleship from the
Seaport to assist in the
tackling of the remaining foes.
With enough enemies subdued,
move on to smash the Minicannons
(use the Battleship to open the
festivities), rushing them in
one big move, as they can only
do so much damage before the
next turn, knocking all three
out to take the victory!

Difficulty  : 4/10

Day One to Day Ten will have
Sensei leading the way at first,
making use of his superior
transport movement capabilities,
getting Infantry as far out into
the furthest reaches of
Properties, forcing Kindle to
waste time battling for them
instead o taking them. With one
strike force working up the west
side of the map, using a an
Artillery or two with Tanks to
subdue any opposition while the
stronger force goes through the
pipe seams to take the Airport
and battle the main enemy force
that will come down the east
side of the map. Two Piperunners
will attack (one versus each
strike force), so get Tanks in
close enough to really pound on
them and eliminate them as early
as possible. Once the main chunk
of properties have been snagged,
it is time for Grimm to come in
and begin the assault in
earnest.

Day Eleven onwards will focus on
Grimm pounding the enemy with
Tanks, Anti-Airs, Artillery, and
even a couple Bombers, as he
will be able to push the line
back, allowing APCs to bring up
Infantry to take the final
Properties required to gain the
victory. It is also nice for
your score to smash extra pipe
seams before taking the final
property, as it will add to your
overall score after the map is
over.

Mission Name: Omens And Signs
Suggested CO: Colin & Max
Enemy CO    : Koal & Jugger
Difficulty  : 5/10

A two front mission, the main
front will benefit from
stronger, more expensive units
to purchase, so Colin is a great
choice there. The secondary
front is more open to choice, so
choose someone who you like,
though Max does have that
offensive direct firepower
bonus, and Sasha has a great Tag
Power rating with Colin, so
either of them should be leading
candidates.

Day One to Day Ten on the main
front will begin by taking the
closer properties to the
homebase area, followed by
moving southward to take the Com
Towers and southern Factory.
While this is happening, have
Artillery and Rockets move south
as well, getting them into
position to bust up the enemy
Cruisers (allowing the Carriers
to drop the Stealth Fighters) as
well as bust the Pipe Seams.
Send all but two of the Fighters
to the second front, keeping
those two handy to hammer the
enemy air units (send them
skyward once the main front is
clear of enemy air units).
Finally, cut down as many of the
enemy units along the way,
staying away from the
Minicannons, as they are
invulnerable. The second front
will consist of destroying all
enemy Fighters, allowing the
survivors to turn on the
fortress, taking out the
supports to crash it, ending the
second battle.

Day Eleven onwards will have the
enemy pushed back even more,
using all available units (and a
Battleship bought with
spendthrift Colin) to lay into
the four Minicannons, as they
are now vulnerable with the
fortress above disabled. A Tag
Power will likely be available
as well, so use it to really
push on the enemy to get a
better Power score.

Day One to Day Four for Orange
Star will have an objective of
moving right at the forest
ahead, having the APC drop an
Infantry right into the trees,
which will spot the charging
Oozium 238, allowing the
Megatank/Neotanks/Md Tanks to
team up and wham the Oozium 238
in one round (it must be
defeated in one round or it will
eat a valuable unit on the next
turn). Blue moon will make use
of their indirects to pound on
the initial enemy troops, using
the Tanks and APCs as protective
barriers to keep the hard
hitters healthy. he second wave
of attack will come in the form
of B-Copters, so ready the Anti-
Airs and Missile units to bring
them down from the skies. The
final piece of advice is to
almost fill the enemy Power
Meters, but end your turn before
completely fill them up, as the
enemy will just attack instead
of using the powers, allowing
for an extra turn of poundings
on them, leaving them with too
few units to mount an effective
Tag Power offensive.

Day Five onwards will continue
the push to the east, with both
units taking a Com Tower to
improve their firepower. Another
Oozium 238 lies in wait in the
forests near the main road and
the mountains, so once it draws
near whack it with the powerful
tanks to get rid of the threat.
The final surprise the enemy has
in store are a pair of Neotanks
hiding in the trees near their
Headquarters, so make use of the
Missile Silos to bombard the
area (even if you can not see
the enemy in Fog of War, the
Missiles will still do their
damage), followed by rushing
into mop up the weakened units.
Keep plowing along, routing all
the foes for the easy victory.

Mission Name: Muck Amok!
Suggested CO: Grimm & Jake (OS)
/ Hawke & Lash (BM) Enemy CO :
Koal Difficulty : 3/10

Not a particularly difficult
mission, the proper choice in
CO's proves crucial. Sine the
enemy uses Oozium 238 as the
overwhelming choice for attack,
so Grimm's offensive strengths
and defensive shortcomings will
work swimmingly here, while Jake
has the luxury of a lot of field
tiles to take advantage of for
extra firepower. Finally, Javier
is a solid choice as well, as he
has some Com Towers to make use
of, though his advantages do not
come into play as early as the
other two CO's mentioned here.

Day One to Day Six will begin
with the units fanning out into
two attack groups, one strike
force going east towards the Com
Tower while the other strike
force moves northward towards
the Minicannon. Make use of a
T-Copter and a Mech to get the
aforementioned Com Tower,
withdrawing the Mech before the
Oozium 238 can overwhelm the
position. Remember when
attacking Oozium 238 to wipe out
any Oozium 238 that you attack
in that same round, or it will
absorb and destroy one of your
units. Hawke and Lash should get
their units behind the advancing
rescue party, using their
Rockets to help weaken the
Oozium 238, so use Hawke for his
unit firepower bonus, focusing
on really weak foes as they are
more likely to take damage from
the indirect units, as they are
rather resistant to such units
typically.

Day Seven onwards, keeping up
the Oozium 238 extermination
while having the T-Copter and
the Mech go north to take
another Com Tower. Once the Tag
Power is set up, use it to
really pound the Oozium 238,
allowing a couple units to rush
the Missile unit near the
headquarters, pounding it into
slagged metal, ending the
mission!

Javier and Jess for Orange Star
works well due to the abundance
of Com Towers for Javier to take
and Jess has a lot of treaded
vehicles upon which to use her
special skills. Hawke and Lash
work well at Blue Moon thanks to
some nice terrain for Lash and
Hawke (as always) boasts some
decent unit bonuses. Note that
the Black Crystals will heal all
units within range for 2 Hit
Points before each Black Hole
turn.

Day One to Day Eight will begin
with the first two days being
used to hammer as many of the
weak enemy forces as humanly
possible, followed by smashing
the three southern Black
Crystals. Each army should get
an Infantry to take a Com Tower,
while more Infantry take a
Factory (Orange Star) and an
Airport (Blue Moon). Finally,
make sure that enough Infantry
exist in the south to make use
of the Missile Silos in one
turn, but do not use them yet.

Day Nine onwards will consist of
positioning the troops,
purchasing Anti-Airs and Tanks
for Orange Star while the Blue
Moon forces should add a Black
Bomb and any B-Copters (if
possible). When the attack is
ready, use the Black Bomb to
weaken the front line foes for
the charging units, while the
Infantry in the south should let
the Missile Silo shot go against
the foes a bit further back from
the main line, causing the
entire Black Crystal healing
process to be severely hampered.
After the enemy threat is gone,
go about the business of
smashing up the Black Crystals,
finishing off the mission!

/ Jess & Javier (BM) / Colin &
Sasha (GE) Enemy CO : Koal &
Kindle Difficulty : 6/10

Things are going to be very
difficult on this mission, as
the enemy satellite can only be
disabled by launching nine
Missile Silos (three each in the
various forces areas), making
sure to not let the enemy take
even one, as that will cause the
mission to fail. With this issue
at stake, the time constraint of
50 minutes is also placed upon
your forces as well, making it a
double whammy of challenge. To
get the triple crown, the Black
Obelisk in the center of the map
must be destroyed.

Orange Star will need to make
use of Tanks, Artillery, and
B-Copters to beat back the enemy
advance, also producing some
foot soldiers to go after the
Missile Silos. The Oozium 238
needs to be hit hard all at
once, so let it come to the
Orange Star mountains as opposed
to being aggressive, as it will
be too tough to get enough
concentrated fire to take it
down.

Blue Moon will need to get an
Infantry to the island via a
Lander/Black Boat, while the
rest of the troops advance
southwards, taking properties
(especially the Com Towers),
opening the path forward for the
land troops to push towards the
Black Obelisk (but stay out
until the satellite is
destroyed).

Green Earth will need to send
some troops south to hurt the
enemy near their factory, making
sure an Infantry goes into the
Missile Silo area, making sure
that Black Hole does not slip a
foot soldier there first. After
the enemy is subdued, take the
Factory and Airport in the
south, using Colin's cheaper
units coupled with Sasha's extra
cash flow, producing a lot of
high flying units to pound on
the strong enemy.

With the satellite disabled, go
in after the Black Obelisk,
pounding enemy troops
relentlessly and occupying there
unit production properties (ie
the Factories and Airports),
allowing Orange Star to pound
the Black Obelisk into a pile of
slagged metal!

Day One to Day Three for Orange
Star will consist of getting the
Mech near the northern Missile
Silo while the Infantry gets
near to the southern Missile
Silo. This is done in
anticipation of the attack upon
Black Hole, but do not launch
the Missiles just yet. Blue Moon
should bring the units down
towards the pipeline, using
Grit's superior range to pound
enemy indirects. Green Earth
should get the tanks rolling
towards the pipe seams, as they
will be the sensible blocking
forces for when the pipe seams
are destroyed. Remember to use
the respective APCs for each
force to keep the aircraft in
the sky, the indirect units
bombing away, and to keep the
tanks rolling.

Day Four to Day Five will have
Orange Star foot soldiers hold
their positions. Blue Moon will
have Grit launch explosive
rounds into the enemy indirects
and Megatank, while the Md Tank,
Neotank, and Megatank for Green
earth block the pipe seams. The
Green Earth Battleship and
Artillery should also be used to
send some shots at enemy Anti-
Airs and tanks, having Hawke in
command for his attack bonus.

Day Six to Day Seven will have
the enemy busting through the
pipe seams, so survive the
initial Tag Power attack,
followed by having Orange Star
soften up the Black Hole forces
further with some carefully
placed Missile Silo shots. Blue
Moon and Green Earth will now
have to work over remaining foes
without crossing into enemy
territory, as the enemy
Minicannons will knock a lot of
Hit Points off each unit that
rushes across, making them ripe
for getting picked off.

Day Eight onwards will have the
Blue Moon pound the two central
Minicannons, allowing Green
Earth to rumble through and
smash all enemy Anti-Airs. With
that portion of the force
subdued, it will be a simple
matter for Eagle to take over
for Blue Moon, sending his air
units through to finish the
enemy pounding (along with Green
Earth and Jess controlling the
Tanks). It is also possible to
remove the snowy conditions by
taking the north and south
cities along the pipeline, but
it is not really worth it as the
enemy will be subdued long
before the foot soldiers can be
ferried there via the APCs.

         o------------o

Mission Name: Pincer Strike
Suggested CO: Jess & Javier (OS)
/ Sasha & Colin (BM) Enemy CO :
Jugger & Drake Difficulty : 8/10

Although this mission seems
really unfair at first (due to
Drake's Tsunami/Typhoon and how
it not only damages all units,
but it also reduces fuel in all
units by one half), but it is
actually very doable by a
disciplined player. The key is
to make careful use of turn ends
to keep the full Tag Power for
the enemy to be built up, and to
use Sasha's units to get her
basic CO Power of Market Crash
built up, as it will remove the
Black Hole star meters to ZERO.
Using this stratagem, Drake only
got to use one Tsunami, and by
that point the Blue Moon forces
had already over run their area
of the map, making it a slight
annoyance instead of a full
fledged disaster to the battle.
So, pay careful attention to the
enemy star meters, stopping an
attack early on one turn,
pounding the foe relentlessly on
the next, allowing Sasha to
cancel out their impending
attack with her Market Crash CO
Power.

Day One to Day Two for Orange
Star will begin with the land
unit moving up to the neutral
factory, using an APC and an
Infantry to draw the enemy Md
Tank and Neotank near to the
Orange Star forces, keeping the
Megatank in reserve. Send the
navy (without the Lander) and
the B-Copter eastward, parking
them in the 2 x 2 Reef section
to the south of the landmass
with the neutral Com Towers.
Also, purchase two Infantry on
the first turn while on the
second turn buy a Tank. Blue
Moon should pull back any tanks
within the range of the enemy
Rockets, sitting tight for the
moment.

Day Three to Day Five begins
with the Fog of War rolling in,
so Orange Star will begin by
hitting the enemy Md Tank and
Neotank that threatened
previously, destroying them with
ease. Send the Lander with an
available Infantry across the
bay, looking to start taking the
southern Com Tower. At sea, use
the B-Copters to spot the
Cruiser, using the Battleship to
hammer it, allowing the
Submarine to go after the enemy
Battleship. This just leaves the
enemy Submarine, so get your
Cruiser to land a brutal hit to
decimate it. Blue Moon should
get the indirect units as close
to the edge of the forest as
possible, shooting the enemy
Rockets/Artillery/Battleship,
destroying them quickly and
efficiently as possible. Use the
Recons to spot units beside the
Blue Moon Cities while the tank
forces should all spread out in
anticipation of the upcoming
rush attack.

Day Six to Day Ten for Orange
Star will look to get onto the
northeast road, rolling from
Forest to Forest in methodical
fashion, flushing out enemy
units so they can be destroyed
by the trailing units. In the
mean time, keep taking the
southeastern properties, having
the Lander bring a couple more
Infantry to assist in this
endeavour. Blue Moon should rush
out of the Forest tiles after
the second Market Crash power,
using the extra boost in attack
to smash the remaining enemy
units, destroying/disabling
every single unit with at least
one attack each. With the area
secure, send the Infantry and
Mech out of hiding via APCs,
taking the neutral Factory and
Airport before the rushing Black
Hole troops can arrive. This
will allow Sasha to use the
extra cash she built up (due to
her abilities) on expensive
Bombers and Tanks, rolling out
some support for Orange Star on
the road ahead.

Day Eleven onwards strategy will
be dictated by the preferred
method of victory by the player.
Decide whether it would be best
to just take the enemy
Headquarters, or whether
destroying all foes is the best
way to go. Orange Star can use
their navy to sweep the eastern
coastline for hiding enemy foes
while the combined Orange Star
and Blue Moon forces go along
the mountains, grinding all the
foes along the way into dust.
Otherwise, have some APCs carry
some Infantry towards the
Headquarters, using the other
units to block access for the
enemy, allowing the foot
soldiers to capture to their
hearts content.

         | Mission 25 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Ring Of Fire
Suggested CO: Grit & Hawke
Enemy CO    : Koal & Kanbei
Difficulty  : 5/10

This map has an 18 Day limit for
destroying all the enemy forces,
so best get to work!

Day to Day Three for the main
front will have Grit sending his
forces on the outer ring of the
map northward after the Factory
that lies that way while another
chunk of forces go east towards
the neutral Airport. Since the
enemy will come after the
factory pathway much more
strongly, send a few extra units
northward instead of to the
east. However, send enough Anti-
Airs on the first turn of the
map to the second front (via
moving them to the Headquarters)
to make them number four on the
second front, followed by
boosting the Rocket unit to the
second front in the same manner.
As for the inner ring of the
map, have the indirect units
here pound the enemy indirect
units inside the mountain range,
but ignore all other units in
there for now and instead
concentrate the forces near the
Factory and put a couple of
indirects near the Airport, as
this will help halt the Black
Hole advance. Hawke on the
second front will just need to
commandeer the two Com Towers
with his foot soldiers, leaving
the remaining units to withdraw
into the southwest corner of the
map (near the Headquarters) in
the following formation:

___________________
Key                |
        |   __ __ __ __
AA - Anti-Air | |AA|XX| | | BC -
B-Copter | |__|__|__|__| MI -
Missile | |BC|AA|XX| |
PC - APC           |  |__|__|__|
RO - Rocket | |MI|PC|AA| | XX -
Infantry/Mech | |__|__|__|__|
        |  |RO|MI|BC|AA|
___________________|  |__|__|__|

This will protect the valuable
air killing units versus the
incoming B-Copters.

Day Four to Day Six on the main
front consists of finishing the
capturing of the Factory and
Airport, all the while
delivering vicious blows to the
approaching tanks and Anti-Airs
(helps out the B-Copters and
Bombers that are to come via
purchases). The first turn with
the B-Copters in range will
consist of hitting them hard,
taking them down one by one
(using Missiles first, followed
by Anti-Airs), BUT stop the
attack JUST before Kanbei's Star
Meter fills up, ending your turn
there. By doing this he will not
get to use his Super CO Power,
with a lot of units in play, so
just position the rest of the
units in spots to protect the
Missiles from direct attack. On
the next turn you can finish off
the remaining B-Copters, leaving
one Neotank for the enemy to
make use of on the Super CO
power, so move the Rocket
forward to prep for the take
down (B-Copters can do the rest
of the work).

Day Seven to Day Nine on the
main front will have Tanks and
B-Copters rolling out of the
Factory and Airport production
lines respectively, using them
to assist the indirect units
from the inner ring in beating
back the Black Hole forces. Also
be on the look out for the
Oozium 238, as it will begin to
cross the river, so use Mechs
and B-Copters to destroy it,
waiting for one turn where four
solid attacks can be launched
upon the obscenity. Finish off
the Neotank on the second front
and begin to ferry the foot
soldiers through the raining
lava, starting to capture the
four cities around the base of
the volcano.

Day Ten onwards The main front
will continually push forward,
crushing all Black Hole forces
(some of the indirects can now
switch over to attacking the
contained foes inside the
mountain range, with some
assistance from a Bomber or
B-Copters). On the second front,
finish off the enemy forces and
capture the four Cities around
the volcano, allowing the second
front CO to join the main
battle. A Tag Power attack
should be available at this
point, using the opportunity to
really push Black Hole to the
edge of extinction, keeping the
efforts up to finish off the map
with the defeat of the final
Black Hole unit!

         | Mission 26 |
         o------------o

Mission Name: Surrounded!
Suggested CO: Hawke & Lash (OS)
/ Sensei & Javier (BM) Enemy CO
: Kindle & Andy Difficulty :
6/10

The time limit here is 24 Days,
with the goal being the
capturing of the four Com Towers
near each massive Missile Silo.
Not a tough map, especially if
an aggressive stance is used
early to put Black Hole on the
defensive.

Day One to Day Three for Orange
Star will begin by going after
the Factory in the northeast,
followed by using the Md Tank
and Neotank to dissuade the
enemy Anti-Airs below from
rushing up to smash into the
foot soldiers moving out towards
the properties in the east.
While continuing to put pressure
on the Anti-Airs and Artillery
(drop a Mech inside the range of
the Artillery via an APC), also
take the Factory and begin to
claim the Com Tower. In the
center of the map, be sure to
purchase Tanks and Artillery,
using them to keep the charging
Black Hole forces bottlenecked.
Blue Moon will use the Recon to
bait the Tank and Anti-Air in
the south to come towards the
bulk of their forces, also using
an APC (park it on the City that
only one of the B-Copters can
reach) to draw the enemy
B-Copters from the southwest in
the same manner. Push forward
aggressively to pound the enemy
positions in the south, taking
the Com Tower and
Airport/Factories, while in the
north purchase an Infantry,
followed by Mechs on each turn
(they will hold up the enemy Md
Tank while the Infantry goes
after the next Com Tower).
Finally, once south is secured,
have the Rocket begin to pound
the pipe seam to make a second
opening into the western
quadrant.

Day Four to Day Six will have
Orange Star finish taking the
eastern quadrant Com Tower,
swinging their attention around
to hold off Black Hole from the
west with some units, while the
rest move north to assist Blue
Moon there in disabling the Md
Tank and any other units rolling
out of the Factory. Blue Moon
should cover the enemy's Factory
in the southern quadrant with a
unit (until an Infantry can
arrive), followed by spilling
through the busted pipe seam to
quell the enemy resistance from
the western quadrant, taking the
Com Tower with the enemy Factory
below cut off by overwhelming
Blue Moon forces.

Day Seven onwards will have just
the north quadrant left to tame,
but with so little left Black
Hole can quickly be crushed,
especially since all foot
soldiers in the other three
quadrants will keep taking more
properties, lessening Black
Hole's resources while
strengthening their own. Once
the fourth Com Tower is secured,
the map will end, and it should
be done in 12 Days or less (took
me 9 Days personally).

         o------------o

Mission Name: For The Future!
Suggested CO: Javier & Jess (OS)
/ Grit & Hawke (BM) / Eagle &
Sensei (GE) Enemy CO : Von Bolt
Difficulty : 8/10

For Day One to Day Five strategy
to work properly, the following
rules should be followed. The
most important step is to build
up Von Bolt's Star Meter until
it just about full, followed by
ending the turn for Orange Star
(make sure Javier has done all
the fighting to this point).
Blue Moon and Green Earth will
continue to do their unit
position juggling to prep for
the incoming forces (taking
Cities if they have to still do
so as well), but they will NOT
attack, leaving the Star Meter
just short. This means that Von
Bolt will attack on the next
turn, hurting Orange Star and
filling his own meter, which he
will not use (if he does, then
the plan will fail). Now that it
is Orange Star's turn, Javier
should be able to smack out a
Super CO Power (ie Tower Of
Power) INSTEAD of the Tag Power
(if you have both Star Meters
filled, do not Tag Power). The
reason for this is that Von
Bolt's Ex Machina will damage
all the Orange Star troops AND
paralyze them, BUT he will
mostly have Artilleries left at
his disposal, which will be
UNABLE to damage Javier's
troops. Sounds complicated, but
if done right it basically
forces Von Bolt to waste his one
good shot at gutting Orange
Star, so follow the directions
for each force for the first
five days to make it work
properly.

Day One to Day Five for Orange
Star will have two main goals;
the first is to take the three
Com Towers and the second is to
hold off the enemy forces. Let
Javier have control all the way
here, starting off by taking the
two outside Com Towers, also
buying another Infantry to move
up to the middle Com Tower via
an APC. Use the Megatank above
the central Com Tower, making it
play blocker until it is
destroyed, allowing for the
three Com Towers to be taken.
Keep buying Artilleries and
Tanks, using them to replace the
front line troops while pounding
the foe with the indirects.

Day One to Day Five Blue Moon
will begin with Grit in command,
using the first two turns to
start taking the neutral City
near their group of properties,
buying an APC, sending the
Infantry up on foot towards the
neutral Cities on the coast,
while the Mech on the left goes
into the APC to follow along
(take both Cities). The
Battleship should take the first
two turns to decimate the lower
Minicannon, followed by trying
to bait the enemy navy into
attacking the Carrier, allowing
the Blue Moon navy (which will
be reinforced by a second
Battleship from funds collected)
to counter-attack.

Day One to Day Five for Green
Earth will begin with Sensei in
command, using the first two
turns to start taking the
neutral City near their group of
properties, buying a T-Copter,
sending the Infantry up on foot
towards the neutral Cities on
the coast, while the Mech on the
right goes into the T-Copter to
follow along (take both Cities).
After the T-Copter dumps the
Mech on it, switch control to
Eagle at the end of that turn,
followed by flying the T-Copter
into range of the enemy Fighter,
baiting it into attacking,
allowing Green Earth to use the
own Fighter and Stealth (in that
order) to eliminate it. Save the
money that is gained, purchasing
Bombers to assist in hitting the
Minicannons and Black Crystals.

Day Six onwards will focus on
Orange Star busting up through
the Black Crystal to occupy the
Black Hole Factories, with Blue
Moon's Grit providing Battleship
fire support from the flank.
Meanwhile, Green Earth will
sweep in with Bombers in the
service of Eagle, supporting the
fight, moving northward to hit
the Black Obelisk with a Bomber,
destroying it one hit thanks to
Eagle's superior air firepower
capabilities. Try to eliminate
as many foes as possible before
delivering the final blow, as
getting a good Power score
depends upon it.

         o------------o

Mission Name: Means To An End
Suggested CO: Jake & Rachel (OS)
Enemy CO    : Von Bolt & Kindle
Difficulty  : 7/10

Note that on Day Six, Day
Twelve, and Day Eighteen that
the three weak points of the G
Bolt will release an Oozium 238
each (three in total). Although
it is not overly dangerous, it
is a good thing to keep in mind
to avoid losing some stronger
units from carelessness.

Day One to Day Six on the main
front will have Jake spend his
first three Days buying four
Infantry and one T-Copter, with
three of the Infantry moving on
to local properties (beginning
the capturing of the locales)
while the one Infantry that can
get onto the T-Copter flies
south to start the assault on
the mass of properties and Black
Hole Infantry found down there.
The T-Copters are to ignore the
Oozium 238s down there, going
for the two Airports (one on
each side of the map), taking
said Airports to begin producing
the B-Copters needed to subdue
the enemy Infantry. It is not a
bad idea on Day Four to send an
additional B-Copter to the
south, followed by purchasing
Tanks and Anti-Airs to work over
the incoming enemy Infantry and
APCs. Jake should ignore the
Oozium 238s at the top of the
screen as well, due to lack of
concentrated firepower to take
them out in one turn. On the
second front it is impossible to
control the action directly, so
tell Rachel to play things
defensively, letting Black Hole
come after her, away from the
Black Crystals and their healing
powers.

Day Seven to Day Twelve will
have Jake consolidating his hold
on the southern part of the map,
using B-Copters to clear the
area of Infantry while the
T-Copters bring in other
Infantry to help knock out the
Black Hole Cities, serving the
two-fold purpose of gaining more
funds while cutting off Black
Hole's funding at the same time.
More B-Copters should be bought,
using them as extermination
squads for the Oozium 238s.
Meanwhile, in the north a Md
Tank and more Anti-Air/Tank
purchases will help take control
of the area, followed by moving
into more advanced purchases,
like Bombers/Neotanks (always
make sure to make the most
valuable purchase possible), but
stay away from Artilleries and
Rockets, as the enemy Oozium
238s are practically invincible
versus indirect attacks. The
second front should be switched
to a more aggressive posture,
allowing Rachel to go after the
now weakened troops (thanks to
her Super CO Power and the
Missile Silos).

Day Thirteen onwards will
continue the push northwards,
using the Tag Power that will
come of Rachel's smashing of all
three Black Crystals on the
secondary front, allowing her to
join Jake on the main front.
Spread out the attacking units,
pounding the Oozium 238s before
they can get too concentrated,
which will allow them to kill
some units (make sure to NEVER
stop beside one, as they will
destroy whatever they touch).
Once it is possible to do so,
cover the enemy Factories with
injured units, which will keep
them from adding in additional
units to the attack, also
sending fully powered Neotanks
or Bombers to work on the three
weak points of the G Bolt,
knocking them out (just remember
to not attack them directly on
Day Six, Day Twelve, or Day
Eighteen, as the G Bolt will
expel some more Oozium 238s from
the weak points). Once all three
weak points are smashed, the
mission is over and the game is
complete! CONGRATULATIONS!!!

    two turns. This attack will
    also damage all enemy units
    for 2 Hit Points of damage.

           ~~~~~~~~~~
         ~~~~ Grit ~~~~
           ~~~~~~~~~~

Grit is a laid back fellow, so
it stand to reason his strength
is long range attacks.
Therefore, his Rockets,
Artillery, Missiles, Carriers,
and Battleships all have
increased power (+20% Offense
boost) and an extra space of
range on their shots while his
direct combat units are less
powerful (-20% Offense boost).

CO Power: Snipe Attack Effect..:
Adds an extra range space to
each of his long range units in
play
  as well as adding some extra
  power (+40% Offense and +10%
  Defense boost) to the shots.
  All other units experience a
  +10% Offense
    and +10% Defense boost.

Super CO Power: Super Snipe
Effect........: Adds two extra
range spaces to each of his long
range units
    in play as well as adding
    some extra power (+40%
    Offense and
    +10% Defense boost) to the
     shots. All other units
    experience a +10% Offense
    and +10% Defense boost.

        ~~~~ Colin ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

A young CO that had just been
promoted in the previous war,
his units lack the experience to
be completely effective (-10%
Offense and -10% Defense boost).
However, his cost for units is
20% less than the normal cost,
making him able to get a large
quantity of units out in a
hurry.

CO Power: Gold Rush Effect..:
When used, your funds will be
multiplied by 1.5, which is a
  fantastic way to get even more
  cash to purchase cheap units
  with. All units receive a +10
  Offense and +10% Defense boost
  as well.

Super CO Power: Power Of Money
Effect........: Weaponry in all
active units will be increased
by the war
    coffers Colin possesses. The
    more money he holds in
    reserve, the more powered-up
    the weapons will be. All
    units receive a +10 Offense
    and +10% Defense boost as
    well.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~

The sister of Colin, she was not
active in any of the previous
wars, but she has decided to
join her sibling in tackling
Black Hole. Her units are of
average quality, but she boasts
such good bookkeeping that she
is able to draw an extra 100
Gold from each of her properties
on every turn.

CO Power: Market Crash Effect..:
All units get a +10% Offense and
+10% Defense boost in addition
to
  opposing Co star power meters
  being reduced by 10% for every
  5000 Gold in Sasha's
  possession.

Super CO Power: War Bonds
Effect........: All units get a
+10% Offense and +10% Defense
boost in
    addition to 50% of all
    damage dealt will be funded
    back into her war coffers
    (ie a Neotank is worth 22000
    Gold, so if she damages it
    for 5 Hit Points, she would
    get 11000/2 = 5500 Gold for
    that attack).

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Kanbei ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~

The leader of Yellow Comet, he
has the best trained troops
around, which means they ALL get
20% effectiveness (Offense and
Defense) in battle. However, to
train his troops so well, it
costs Kanbei an extra 20% to do
so.

CO Power: Morale Boost Effect..:
His units get a +40% Offense and
+10% Defense boost.

Super CO Power: Samurai Spirit
Effect........: His units get a
+40% Offense and +10% Defense
boost while
    his counter attacks by his
    units deal twice the normal
  amount until his next turn.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Sensei ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~

An old master of the game of
war, he trained Kanbei on how to
wage war. He is an old
paratrooper who has especially
effective Infantry (+10% Offense
and +10% Defense boost) and
Helicopters (+50% Offense and
+50% Defense boost), but his
naval units have a -10% Offense
and -10% Defense boost. His
transports also boast an extra
movement space, meaning he can
move his troops in a hurry.

CO Power: Copter Command
Effect..: B Copter get a +30%
Offense and a 10% Defense boost,
all other
  units get a +10% Offense and
  +10% Defense boost. All of
  Sensei's empty Cities will
  gain an Infantry each with 9
  Hit Points.

Super CO Power: Airbourne
Assault Effect........: B Copter
get a +30% Offense and a 10%
Defense boost, all
    other units get a +10%

          ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Sonja ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

Daughter to Kanbei, she is a
master of intel. Her units fight
best in Fog Of War situations as
they see an extra space over
opponents, but her units will be
unlucky in scoring extra damage
in attacks most of the time,
even losing a damage point they
should deal. However, enemies
can not tell how many Hit Points
remain on her units, and she is
able to ignore 1 star of enemy
terrain defensive advantage (ie
Plains count as 0 instead of 1).

CO Power: Enhanced Vision
Effect..: Her units gain an
extra vision space in Fog Of War
situations and
  allows her units to see into
  the Woods and Reefs without
  being right beside them. All
  units also boast a +10%
  Offense and +10% Defense boost
  as well as getting the enemy
  defense stars down by 2 (ie
  City counts as 1 instead of
  3).

Super CO Power: Counter Break
Effect........: Her units gain
an extra vision space in Fog Of
War
    situations and allows her
    units to see into the Woods
    and Reefs without being
    right beside them. All units
    also boast a +10% Offense
    and +10% Defense boost as
    well as pushing the enemy
    defense stars down by 3 (ie
    Headquarters counts as 1
    instead of 4), and she also
    strikes first during any
    attacks on the next
    opponent's turn.

        ~~~~ Grimm ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

This offensively minded meathead
focuses so much on attacking
that his attention to the
defensive side of war is sorely
under developed (+30% Offense
and -20% Defense boost). Also,
since he is lax on his defensive
preparedness, his units can get
slammed for extra damage by any
CO, not just the ones with the
default luck.

CO Power: Knuckleduster
Effect..: Grimm's already
offensive minded units will get
a +30% Offense
  boost and a default +10%
  Defense boost.

Super CO Power: Haymaker
Effect........: Grimm's units
will get a ridiculous +60%
Offense boost
    (making them a whopping
    190%!) and a +10% Defense
    boost.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Eagle ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

The wild man in the skies, Eagle
gets a +20% Offense boost with
his Air units as well as less
fuel consumption (2 units less
per day). However, his naval
units are slightly underpowered
(-10% boost), so his using a
Navy is not a particularly good
idea for the commander in chief
of the Green Earth forces.

CO Power: Lightning Drive
Effect..: All of his units (sans
Infantry and Mechs) will get a
second turn
  to attack, but on the second
  attack they get the following
  bonuses: Air units (-50%
  Offense and 10% Defense
  boost), Direct Land units
  (-40% Offense and +10% Defense
  boost), and Indirect Land
  units (-35% Offense and +10%
  Defense boost). Infantry and
  Mechs get a more typical +10
  Offense and +10% Defense boost
  for their one attack with this
  power.

Super CO Power: Lightning Strike
Effect........: All of his units
(sans Infantry and Mechs) will
get a second
    turn to attack, though all
    get a +10% Offense and +10%
    Defense boost for both
    rounds of attacks.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~ Drake ~~~~
          ~~~~~~~~~~~

Master of the seas, Drake has
the ability to have a 20%
Offense boost with his seafaring
vessels. However, his Air units
are of a very poor quality,
taking a -10% Offense boost on
those. He is an integral part of
Green Earth's command structure,
keeping their seas clear of foes
that would do the country harm.

CO Power: Tsunami Effect..: This
will remove 1 Hit Point from
every enemy unit, and remove
  half of their total fuel. All
  of his units will get a +10%
  Offense and 10% Defense boost
  as well.

Super CO Power: Typhoon
Effect........: This will remove
2 Hit Points from every enemy
unit, and
    remove half of their total
    fuel. All of his units will
    get a +10% Offense and 10%
    Defense boost in addition to
    the weather changing to rain
    with the possibility of Fog
    of War rolling into play for
    a couple of turns following
    the storm.

A vehicle specialist, she is the
ground power of the Green Earth
army (+20% Offense boost).
However, her Air and Naval
forces are slightly weaker (-10%
Offense boost) due to her
superior vehicle knowledge.

CO Power: Turbo Charge Effect..:
Vehicles gain one movement
space, ammo and fuel are
replenished
  completely, and a +30% Offense
  and 10% Defense boost is
  experienced. All other units
  get a +10 Offense and +10%
  Defense boost.

Super CO Power: Overdrive
Effect........:Vehicles gain two
movement spaces, ammo and fuel
are
   replenished completely, and a
   +30% Offense and 10% Defense

The newcomer to the Green Earth
CO ranks, this honourable knight
of the forest is a big supporter
of defense as the way to
victory, as he boasts a
+20% Defense boost versus
 indirect attacks as well as
 getting +10 Defense
boost from every Tower he
controls (to go with the
traditional +10 Offense boost
they give to everyone).

CO Power: Tower Shield Effect..:
Gets a +20% Defense boost versus
indirect attacks and Tower
  bonuses are now doubled. All
  units get a +10% Offense and

A rather impatient and
headstrong CO, he likes to
attack, attack, attack. His
attack power can be stronger
than the normal amounts (up to
+25% Offense boost), but his
poor leadership causes his units
to cause less damage than they
could (as much as -10% Offense
boost).

CO Power: Brute Force Effect..:
All units get a +10% Offense and
+10% Defense boost. All units
  will have an increased chance
  of landing a harsh blow (as
  much as
  +50% Offense boost), but their
   also is a chance of dealing
   less
  damage (-20% Offense boost).

Super CO Power: Barbaric Blow
Effect........: All units get a
+10% Offense and +10% Defense
boost. All
    units will have an increased
    chance of landing a harsh

Very self-absorbed, Adder thinks
himself truly great. He tends to
make good decisions, and he has
no strength or weaknesses. He
also stores up his CO Power
faster than any other CO, even
Koal.

CO Power: Sideslip Effect..: His
units gain an extra movement
space and all get a +10% Offense
    and +10% Defense boost.

Super CO Power: Sidewinder

The brilliant mind behind many
of the Black Hole installations,
she is an average CO with no
strengths or no weaknesses.
However, every defensive star
that exists on a square that a
unit attacks from, they get a
+5% Offense boost (ie from a
city, it is a +15% Offense
boost).

CO Power: Terrain Tactics
Effect..: All units get a +10%
Offense and +10% Defense boost.
All terrain
  movement costs drop to 1,
  essentially making all spaces
  like roads.

Super CO Power: Prime Tactics
Effect........: All units get a
+10% Offense and +10% Defense
boost. All
    terrain movement costs drop
    to 1, essentially making all
    spaces like roads. All

The former top CO under Sturm,
he is now working with the Omega
Land Black Hole CO's, despite
the apparent lack of respect
they have for him. His units
have a +10% Offense boost, but
his CO Powers take the longest
of any CO to build up.

CO Power: Black Wave Effect..:
All of his damaged units gain
one Hit Point while enemy units
lose
  one Hit Point (will not kill a
  one Hit Point unit). All units
  get a +10% Offense and +10%
  Defense boost.

This strange one bears some
similarities to one Black Hole
CO Adder, as both are average in
their units, and both have very
short star bars to fill for
their Co Power/Super CO Powers.
However, he also possesses a
+10% Offense boost on roads,
making his forces kings of the
paved pathways.

CO Power: Forced March Effect..:
His units gain an extra movement
space and all get a +10% Offense
  and +10% Defense boost. They
  also get a +20% Offense boost
  when attacking on Roads.

Super CO Power: Sidewinder
Effect........: His units gain
two extra movement spaces and
all get a +10%
    Offense and +10% Defense
    boost. They also get a +20%

This computerized creation has
an unknown origin, and he is a
lot like the big ape Flak. His
units have no strengths or
weaknesses (average rules the
day), and he has a potential for
greater damage dealt (+30%
Offense boost) and for lesser
damage than normal being dealt
(-15% Offense boost).

CO Power: Overclock Effect..:
All units get a +10% Offense and
+10% Defense boost. All units
  will have an increased chance
  of landing a harsh blow (as

   also is a chance of dealing

boost. All
    units will have an increased

The leader of the Bolt Guard,
she is the new second in command
of the Black Hole forces,
thinking little of the old Black
Hole CO's. She has average units
for abilities, but they get a
bonus of +40% Offense boost
whenever they are residing upon
any property (ie Cities,
Headquarters, etc.).

CO Power: Urban Blight Effect..:
Any opposing forces that are
residing on a property will
receive
  3 Hit Points worth of damage
  and her units will deal more
  damage from properties (+80%
  Offense boost). All units get
  a +10%
Offense and +10% Defense boost.

Super CO Power: High Society
Effect........: Kindle's units
will deal more damage from
properties
    (+130% Offense boost), and
    All units get a +10% Offense
    and

The new leader of the Black Hole
forces, he also is behind the
odd circumstances of many of the
battlefields. His units draw a
+10 Offense boost and +10%
Defense boost, so they are
always fighting fit and looking
to lay a hurt on opposing
forces.

CO Power: None. Effect..: He
focuses so much on Super CO
Power, he does not have one.

Super CO Power: Ex Machina
Effect........: A bolt of
electricity will smash into
troops in a focused
    area (same size as a Black
    Bomb's detonation area) to
    remove 3 Hit Points, and it
    has the secondary effect of
    rendering all units in the
    blast radius immobile for
    one full turn.

        | Rules Of Use |
        o--------------o

-As a CO gets promoted to new
 levels, each new Level will be
 unlocked for potential use.

-With each promotion for the
 first three levels, another
 Skill may be selected for use
 (up to a max of 4).

-If two Skills that affect the
 same thing are selected, then
 the Skill values will actually
 stack, giving the value of
 both.

-The Star Level if Skills are
 only available after the
 campaign is finished.

7) This section will look at how
   each special installation of
   the Black Hole Army works,
   and how to deal with them.


           o--------o
           | Cannon |
           o--------o

Description: A Giant Cannon that
covers a massive area with it's
destruction
     (one direction only).

Power......: Removes up to 5 Hit
Points, but it can not finish
off an unit.
   Also, the number of turns it
   takes to power a shot is
      determined per area.

Weakness...: The doors on the
front of these installations can
be attacked.
   After a total of at least
   100% damage has been dealt,
   the
     Cannon will meltdown.


          o----------o
          | Fortress |
          o----------o

Description: A large building
that helps the Black Hole
maintain their hold
   on an area.

Power......: Does not attack,
but it can not be directly
damaged either.

Weakness...: None since it can
not be destroyed.


        o-------------o
        | Mini-Cannon |
        o-------------o

Description: A smaller version
of the Cannon, it's range is
considerably
   less, but it still packs a
   nasty punch (one direction
   only).

Power......: Removes up to 3 Hit
Points, but it can not finish
off an unit.
   Also, the number of turns it
   takes to power a shot is
      determined per area.

Weakness...: After a total of at
least 100% damage has been
dealt, the
   Mini-Cannon will meltdown.


          o----------o
          | Pipeline |
          o----------o

Description: These will snake
through a map, often channeling
troops through
   certain areas. Some sections
   can be destroyed.

Power......: They work as walls,
not even allowing air units to
pass over
   them.

Weakness...: Anywhere a pipe
seam can be attacked, at least
100% damage is
   required to break through.

   Great game! Simply no other
   way to put it, and I hope
   this FAQ helped some people
   out with their troubles! Do
   keep in mind that these
   strategies are rather general
   in the whole, and even the
   specific strategies can be
   struck void by an enemy CO
   acting outside their regular
   behaviours.

   Credit to Xenesis Xenon and
   his CO FAQ on GameFAQs, as it
   helped me with some of the
   specific % boosts for some
   CO's.

    Thanks to all readers who
send in suggestions, as without
input I am    often unable t
further improve my FAQ, which
does not help anyone.  I
always accept new material (as
stated before), just be polite,
clear, and    concise when you
send in a strategy and I will
evaluate it to see if it
should go in the FAQ or not.
