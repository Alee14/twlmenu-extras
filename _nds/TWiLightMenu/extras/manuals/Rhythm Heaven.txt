Intro...........................
--------------------------------

Well, I think it'd be approprite
if I introduced myself first. My
name is Matthew, but here on
GameFAQs, I'm know as
Bazzoka_Kirby. Else where, I'm
also known as just Bazzoka. And
to further shorten that, my nick
name is Bazz. I myself enjoy
rhythm games above most other
games I've played, and Rhythm
Heaven is definitely one of my
favourite games for the DS. I
thought about making this for a
little, and so, here I am,
typing this up. I thank you for
taking a look at this guide. In
fact, this is my first time
doing something like this, so
forgive me and my horrible
guide, but I assure you it will
get better as I get more into
it!

To find what you need, just open
up the find command (Ctrl+f) and
type in the code for whatever
and search away.

For anyone who wishes to put
this up elsewhere, please,
inform me via e-mail. I'd rather
not if you took this without my
permission. But, if you're
really impatient, you can put it
anyway, but be sure to give me
credit. E-Mail is at the
beginning of the whole thing,
but I'll put it right here.

My e-mail:
Bazzoka_Kirby@yahoo.ca

So... you can't say you can't
find it now.

--------------------------------
What's this game?...............
................................
........(WATGM)
--------------------------------

Well, in truth, if you didn't
know about this game before it
came out and when Nintendo
started to advertize it a lot,
there's a good chance you didn't
know this is actually a sequal.
Yes, that's right.

In Japan, a game called Rhythm
Tengoku (which translated into
Rhythm Heaven) for the GBA was
released in 2006. It was just as
crazy as this one, only it used
the buttons since, well, the GBA
didn't have a touch screen. I'm
not gonna bore you with any
history besides that, but
Nintendo didn't bring this one
over seas, but it ended up being
a big success. I guess after
that, they decided if they made
a sequal, they'd bring it over
to see how it'd fare, but that's
only what I think. It's not a
fact... from what I know. In any
case, in Japan, this game is
actually called Rhythm Tengoku
Gold.

So, what is Rhythm Heaven? Well,
it's a rhythm game (duh) along
the lines of quick response
timed games, pretty much like
the Wario Ware Inc. games. This
makes perfect sense since it was
the same people who made the
Wario Ware Inc. games, so there
should obviously be some
similarities.

--------------------------------
General How to play.............
................................
........(HOWTO)
--------------------------------

Well, even though no one reads
the manual, and people might not
even read this, I'll put this
part up anyway.

So, the gameplay of Rhythm
Heaven consists of purely the
touch screen, with the exception
of one game, but I'll more on
that later. There are 4
commands, all of which are easy
to remember and, to me, are easy
to do.

Tap: Should be obvious enough
what this command is. Simply tap
the touch screen. In some cases,
where the game says "tap," it
actually means tap and hold it
there.

Lift: Again, should be obvious.
After holding the stylus on the
touch screen, you'll need to
remove the stylus from the
screen. Some games have this as
their main way of play.

Flick: Again, obvious. A good
chunk of games in Rhythm Heaven
use this command, so you better
get use to it and fast if you
don't wanna be left behind.

Slide: ... Do I have to say how
obvious it is? Some games use
this as their main way of play.

There, the four commands. Learn
them, 'cause it shouldn't be too
hard.

--------------------------------
Start it up.....................
--------------------------------

Really, everyone should know how
to turn on a DS, all three of
them for that matter, and start
up the game.

So, when you do start it up,
you'll be greeted to the opening
title screen; the logo for
Rhythm Heaven, pulsing to the
beat of the background music.
You should also note that this
game must be played sideways.
There is no moment, from when
you start this game up to when
you unlock everything, when you
play this game in the normal
position.

At the top of the touch screen,
it'll say "Lefty" on a light
blue button, followed by "Tap
here if you're left-handed." The
game starts out with it being
set for right-handed people.
When you switch it up,
everything then turns upside-
down. If you need to switch it
back for some reason, that same
button at the new "top" of the
screen will say "Righty,"
accompanied with "Right-handed
people, tap this."

Now, what is that thing in the
middle, saying "Touch me!"?
Well, tap and hold the thing to
enlarge it. There should be a
picture on the enlarged version
of that thing, along with a girl
at the bottom, showing a
flicking motion, with the text
beside her saying "Flick like
this! It's all in the wrist."
The game won't except no baby
flick either. You really gotta
put effort into this, or you'll
never be able to play this game!
Well? What are you waiting for?
Get to it!

--------------------------------
File Menu.......................
--------------------------------

So, now you're at the file
select screen. 3 "NEW GAME"
buttons await to be pressed by
someone. Heck, even that little
creature on the top screen is
even telling you to "Choose
one!" Well, go ahead, do it!
Once you've clicked on one of
the new game buttons, it'll
bring up a bunch of nouns, like
"Me," "Friend," "Mom," "Dad,"
the list goes on. Let's just
read what the little guy has to
say on the top screen, shall we?
"I'll create a save file for
you." Aww, how nice. "Pick a
label for your new file!" Woah,
a label instead of a *insert
name here* thing. That's a
change. Go ahead and choose the
"Me" one, 'cause it is your game
you're playing, right?

Also, a quick note, once someone
uses a label, you can't use it
again. You know how weird it
would be if there were to "Me"s?
Yeah, that doesn't really make
sense.

So, before I go to the next
part, I'll just go ahead and
describe what it'll look like
once you start getting games and
the like.

So, now, it'll have the label
you chose. Beside your label
should be Flow and Medals, along
with a number beside each. I'll
describe these things later. Now
when you actually click on it,
there should a HUGE start
button, which should obviously
mean that you go into your file.
Below it are 3 buttons. "Change
Label," "Erase," and "Back." All
three should be obvious in what
they do. But for those who
really don't and need to find
out, I'll list them.

Change Label: This is where you
can change the label to say "Me"
to "Dad." Why you would give
your own file to someone else is
beyond me, but whatever, more
power to ya.

Erase: This is when you don't
want to continue playing this
file, or you simply don't want
it anymore, and so it would go
poof, thus freeing up space for
others. Again, dunno why you'd
do that, but hey.

Back: Makes go back to the file
selection menu so you can chose
another file to play, just in
case you accidentally clicked on
someone elses file instead of
yours.

NOW I go onto the next part of a
new file.

--------------------------------
Flick Practice..................
................................
........(FLCKP)
--------------------------------

So, this is the main thing
you'll need to learn, flicking!
This is only a simple practice,
but if you keep doing it, it
will help you quite a bit when
you need to dish out those
extremely fast flicks.

So what you'll need to do for
the practice is flick a coin at
a tin can frog. To pass the
practice, you must flick the
coin at the frog can 6 times. It
doesn't have to be in a row, so
don't get all angry if you can't
get it in succession, but it'd
be advisable if you could get
all 6 flicks in succession.

Now, after hitting the frog can
6 times with the coin, you must
hit a toy car that drives by the
screen 5 times. There's a
pattern for how fast the cars
go. The first two that come by
are slow while a third is fast.
This pattern repeats after the
thrid, fast car drives by.
Again, you don't need to hit
these cars in succession, but
it'd help if you could.

After that... you're done the
practice! Yup, that's it. It's
the only command that's hard to
do, apparently, so if you got a
good grip on this, continue
onward!

--------------------------------
Rankings........................
--------------------------------

Rhythm Heaven and its
predecessor have 5 kinds of
ranks when being marked on how
well you played a game. Here
they are from best to worst:

Perfect: The best in the whole
game. Managing to pull a perfect
means that you made zero
mistakes in your run. However,
you can't just do it. You must
wait when the game allows you to
have a chance of scoring this
godly rank. You'll be able to
tell, whether it be the
incredibly obvious note it gives
you after you play a game or how
the game has a boarder that says
"Go for perfect!" with double
eighth notes and a single
quarter note, that's your cue to
try for the perfect rank. But be
warned, you only have 3 shots at
it. Screw up 3 times and you
have to wait until the game
gives you another chance.

Superb: This is the second best
rank, but is the rank that
allows you to go for a perfect,
so it's a needed rank if you
wanna go for perfects. Though
superb works like a good
signifer that you've made little
to no mistakes, it still means
you might have made a mistake
that on a perfect, it might have
counted as a screw up, even if
it doesn't look like it. This
rank, along with opening a
chance of the game chosing it
for a perfect run, it also,
obviously, allows you to pass to
the next game.

Just OK: This is the third rank,
meaning you didn't do bad. In
fact, you were just below a
Superb rank. Maybe you screwed
up by accident a few times.
Don't worry about it, it happens
to everyone. But on the bright
side, though lacking the same
qualities as a Superb rank, it
will still allow you to pass
onto the next game.

OK: This is the fourth rank, and
pretty much the same level as
the Just OK rank. "Then why
bother give it it's own
placing?" you may ask? Well,
though it serves the same as a
Just OK, this means you were
only average, nothing more. You
weren't close to a Superb, and
though you were on your way to a
Try Again, you were in between.

Try Again: The fith and final
rank. There's nothing good about
getting this rank. The reason is
because if you do get it, it
means you didn't do even
decently well. Actually... you
may have done just below an OK,
so... I think the term "practice
practice practice!" comes into
mind. Don't lose faith in your
rhythm skills just yet!
However... if you get this rank,
you won't pass and you'll have
to do this again. Get this rank
3 times in a row, and you can go
to a place for some help and
skip it altogether. More on this
later on.

--------------------------------
How does it rank us?

Now, how the ranking goes about,
I always thought there was a
strict rule of "you can miss
this many and still pass" or
something like that since I was
never the one to make many
mistakes at all during runs.
From looking on the GameFAQs
boards, looking at the response
of 2 people, both of which have
filled in two important holes in
my original thoughts.

1. There seems to be a huge
   difference in a "barely-made-
   it" hit and a miss
altogether. This seems to make
perfect sense, since I've gotten
a few Barely-made-it"'s and
still have gotten a good mark.
Next is...

2. The time when you screw up in
   the game is crucial.
   Apparently, screwing up
at the start isn't as punishing
as screwing up during the
ending. Makes perfect sense, due
to what I thought the Built to
Scale was strict, it is, in
fact, the spot I screwed up at,
which was the very end.

--------------------------------
When do perfects pop up?

Well, I'm unsure when they can
appear, but I think around 6-8
games in after getting a superb
is when Perfect runs will come
in to play. You have 3 chances
and after that, if you get it or
not, it will disappear. The next
time the game gives you a chance
is still unsure to me, but it
seems to no pop up if you
constant get "Try Again" ranks.
But I think it's every 3
"Superb" ranks, not including
the perfect run tries if you
felt like skipping them. I could
be very well wrong and there
might be variations/exceptions
to this, so feel free to help me
figure this out.

EDIT: I actually found out that
if you get every game, except
for 2 OK ranks, the rule above
will lighten slightly to once
every other game to exist. It
becomes every possible chance
you get will be a prefect try
when you get all superb ranks.
Even if you failed it 3 times in
a row, a new game, or the same
game possibly, will be chosen
for a perfect try right after.

--------------------------------
Game Mapping....................
--------------------------------

This is where I make a general
and simple layout for both the
top and touch screens. Both of
which are for fully completed
games, though the only one that
is heavily affected by being
fully completed is the touch
screen. So, let's go!

--------------------------------
Top Screen......................

| \__________________________/  
\_______________________________
_____________      _____________
/ Flow ### \ / Medals ## \
\_____________/    \____________

All things above are blank, bar
Flow and Medals, if you haven't
selected a "game door" as I like
to call them.

So, remember how I said I'd get
back to the Flow and medals?
Well, here it is.

Flow is where the game measures
your rhythmical sense. The
higher the number, the better.
Don't be sad if it's low at the
beginning. The more games you
earn, the higher your Flow could
be. Even if your Flow is really
low, it shouldn't get to you.
How it goes up and down is
determined on how well you play
a game. From what I've seen, the
lowest Flow is 26, but I''ve
been informed that the lowest is
in fact 20, starting out with
doing nothing on Built to Scale
on a new file. Highest I've
gotten is 138, but that doesn't
seem right. The actual highest
is 140 points. Seem like senses
were right.

The thing about Flow, however,
it seems that even if you do
perfect everything, that doesn't
mean an automatic 140 points.
While you got a very good sum of
points from perfecting it, there
are probably tiny tiny errors
the game allows by which can
still determine if you still get
points or not. A good example is
the game "Rockers." Got a
perfect, tried again, I got an
extra point.

Now medals? This is what you get
when you get a Superb rank on a
game. Unlike a OK/Just OK rank,
a Superb rank will give you a
golden boarder around the game
you got the Superb rank on.
Getting medals opens up Endless
games and Rhythm Toys.

Main Game.......................
--------------------------------

For the beginning of each set,
I'll just give my own personal
thought and comments into them.

For each individual game, I'll
use this format:

In-game message:(top screen
message given)

Personal description:(my
personal description on the game
at hand)

Personal thoughts:(any thoughts
I have on mind about this game)

Order of patterns:(only if it's
logical to have one)

Right or Wrong: (tell you how to
notify if you're doing it right
or outright screwing up)

Tips for Superb:

Extra Tips for Perfect:

Perfect get:

Rank messages:

Here's something for Right or
Wrong. Some have 4 different
things while others may only
have 2, but the ones that have 2
will probably be very picky with
timing from Perfects while it'll
be fine for Superbs. The ones
with 4, however, often "Still on
time" is good enough to get
Perfects.

If whatever tips I give don't
work, here's the golden tip of
them all, if not most: If it
doesn't work as well for you,
try closing your eyes. Listening
to just the music can really
help, especially for a majority
of these games in Rhythm Heaven
since all of them have really
crazy visuals.

Remixes will have the format
like so:

In-game message:

Personal description:

Personal thoughts:

Order of games:(order of which
games go when during that
particular remix)

Tips for Superb:

Extra Tips for Perfect:

Perfect get:

Rank messages:

Also note, in both the order of
patterns/games, I cannot give
you the timing, obviously. So,
you must learn the timing on
your own. I only put the list so
you'll be prepared for it.
Sometimes, it might not even
help! A prime example would be
the Moai Doo-Wop. My pattern
list doesn't tell you how long
you need hold it, so you'll just
have to get the timing yourself.

One more notice, for every
perfect run, be calm and
collected during the whole
thing! I know it may be hard,
but think nothing of it while
you play a perfect run. You'll
have less of a chance of
screwing up via being too tense
or some other reason that may
potentially screw you up.

--------------------------------
Set 1...........................
--------------------------------

The first set are the first 4
games you play and will pretty
much be the practice to get a
feel for the rest of the game.
That's not to say this game will
be boring, oh, heavens no. So,
let's get to it, shall we?

--------------------------------
Built to Scale..................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Feel the
rhythm of the factory line as
you build... stuff. It's hard to
explain, so just try playing
it."


Personal description: So, this
game consists of you using the
flick command to shoot a rod at
two white, I'll assume, metal
plates with a hole in both of
them. Obviously, shooting the
rod at these metal plates with
the corret timing will connect
them together. Too late/early
will result with the rob merely
hitting both the plates and
knock them off. Failure to
actually hit them at all will
result with both plates sliding
down two black slits in the
ground. You wanna try and avoid
just hitting them, even more so
with missing.


Personal thoughts: Though it's
the first game, don't
underestimate it. You may very
well do bad if you're not
rhythmically endowed.

Really, this is where you find
out that, if you're like me, the
timing to flick is a bit more
precise then you may think.

And the "Spot light" part, as I
like to call it, can really
screw you over if you're more of
a visual guy.


Right or Wrong: Spot on!: The
rod goes right into the two
metal plates, making a sound
that accompanies the "Do Rei
Mi." The widget created will
move along the convayer belt.

Just barely: The rod will hit
the metal plates, knocking the
plates off. Only the rod appears
on the convayer belt.

Missed: The rod won't even touch
the plates while they go beyond
the construction area and slide
down the two thin holes in the
ground.


Tips for Superb: Remember, the
timing is a little precise, so
it may or may not help you if
you flick ever so slightly later
then you normally would, and I
really do mean slightly.

Also, this is a game that's very
strict for getting a superb...
on the last one. Due to the post
on the GameFAQs Rhythm Heaven
board, I can now say that this
one isn't super strict for
superb. Apparently only the last
one causes you to lose superb
instantly.


Extra Tips for Perfect: I have
nothing to really add on for
this. It's just practice from
here on.

Glee Club.......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Join a trio of
chorus singers. You're the
third, so you just have to keep
up with the others!"


Personal description: Glee Club
consists of, as the message
says, a trio of chorus singers
and you are, again as the
message said, the third one. You
must simply follow along with
the others, mimicking their
moves at the right time. This
game is one of the very few that
uses the lift command as it's
main basis. This game requires
the player to leave the stylus
on the touch screen unless you
want your singer to start
singing at the wrong time. Along
with the lift command, you must
also use the flick command when
the conductor says "Together
now," to yell.


Personal thoughts: Second game,
and I personally didn't find it
all too hard, though a lot of
people seem to find it hard.
This could be because there a
few visual hints as to lift your
stylus.

There are two parts that I would
deem harder then the rest of
this one game. Near the middle,
there's a short and then a
longer "Ah." Getting the shorter
"Ah" can be harder I would
think. Then going off into the
longer "Ah", you may have
already drifted too far off
beat.

The other one could possibly be
the after the one above. Having
to time it so you cut off your
"Ah"ing with everyone else could
be a tad hard.


Order of patterns:
"Ah"
"Ah, 'Together now'"
"Ah"
"Ah"
"Ah, 'Together now'"
"Ah, ah"
"Ah"
"Ah, 'Together now'"
"Ah"
"Ah"
"Ah"


Right or Wrong: Spot on!:
Everything looks in order.

Missed: The other chorus singers
will look at you funny.


Tips for Superb: Enough though
there's a lack of visual aid to
help you out, you can always tap
your foot or count out loud to
get the timing right. Nodding
the head proves to be my main
method of helping myself out
with the less visually helping
ones.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Now,
this one is somewhat picky with
the timing, this being if you
lift a little too early, or a
little too late, you'll lose
that perfect run for that try
even though the others down't
look at you funny, thus, again,
I'd suggest you refine the lift
timing until you get it down for
this one.

Fillbots........................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "This factory
builds robots. (What did you
expect?) It's your job to fuel
'em up once they're built."


Personal description: The in-
game message is right about the
fact you have to fuel them up.
Really, that's all you have to
do. You don't have to build
them, since the game sets that
up for you. However, you must
tap and hold to "fuel 'em up"
and the time when you let go is
fully dependent on which robot
it is. The skinny robot is for 4
beats while the fat ones are for
8 beats. If you don't fill them
up enough, they'll seem sad. If
you fill them up a little too
much, they'll seem like they're
panicking. Fill them up TOO
much, and they'll explode. Yeah,
sure, try it out and laugh, then
get back to being serious. If
you fill them up properly, they
will do a dance! Yeah, that's
right. However, if your timing
truly is spot on, they'll fly up
via boosters. Hey, don't ask me
why.

Personal thoughts: Even though
it's the third game, it's
annoying. It's fairly long and
the ending half of this one is
mostly off-beats, at least from
what I can tell. Well, either
that or seemingly odd timed
normal beats. You have to play
it for yourself to understand
what I'm talking about.

I won't hold anything against
you if you have to skip this
one.


Order of patterns:
5 skinny
1 fat
9 skinny
1 fat


Right or Wrong: Spot on!: The
robot will activate thrusters on
the bottom of it's feet and fly
off screen to the side.

Still on time: The robot will do
a small dance as they're moved
off screen via convaryer belt.

Just barely: Either one- The
robot will tilt his head from
side to side to show he wasn't
completely fueled. OR The robot
will hold his head, looking
panicked, showing that he's been
filled up a little too much.

Missed: Either one- The robot
won't even have a chance of
being filled up and keeps moving
along the convayer belt. OR The
robot will have X's for eyes and
looks pretty much dead. OR The
robot will explode to show it
was filled up too much.


Tips for Superb: When it gets to
the, what I described as, "oddly
timed beats," I think it'd be
best if you, instead of paying
attention to the music, paid
attention to the robot being
built. The "Tonk Tonk Tonk" (or
however you wish to describe it
as) is a good way to help you
time to tap and hold the stylus
on the screen. Maybe someone
with a better musical sense then
I might give you a better tip
then this.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Once
again, it's purely with
practice. I dunno how to help
out other then my method.

Fan Club........................

In-game description: "Pop stars

to get the audience worked up!
Keep time with your firends!"


Personal description: You are a
monkey. Yes. You did read that
right. So you're a monkey that
is part of a crowd, that is,
what I'll assume, the fan club
of the singing on stage. As the
in-game message suggests, you
have to do what your "friends"
do. But this isn't anything like
"Simon says" like Glee Club. Oh
no, you need to do do such
things at the same time.
However, there are audio cues
that help you figure out what to
do and when. A repitition of 3
words results in 4 claps, a
single clap being a single tap.
Then there's the "I suppose."
This results in doing a clap~
clapclap flick... it's hard to
explain. You'll see in the
tutorial.


Personal thoughts: This one
isn't too hard if you've nailed
down the flick first. It's
fairly short, so that's always a
plus. But, I remember someone
pointing this out, this being
that is says do 4 claps when
there's a repitition of 3 words.
HOWEVER, there's a phrase in
there, "love you, love you, love
you~." A simple translation
error since in Japanese, all of
them were single words and
"suki" translates into, from my
little Japanese knowledge, "love
you." But it's one word in
Japanese, so... yeah, I'm sure
you can use common sense to
think up a reasonable excuse for
such a thing.


Order of patterns:
"Yeah yeah yeah"
"I suppose"
"Hocus hocus hocus"
"I suppose"
"Boom boom boom"
"I suppose"
"Love you, love you, love you"
"I suppose"
"Yeah yeah yeah"


Right or Wrong: Spot on!:
Everything looks in order.

Missed: The two monkies beside
you look at you funny.


Tips for Superb: Always remember
to clap after the singer has
said the audio cues, not while
she says them. See, once you get
the feel for the song, sometimes
you can accidentally clap on
instinct for when she actually
says the words and not after...
er, if you're like me that is. I
sometimes still do that...

Rhythm Rally....................
--------------------------------

In-game description: "Return the
ball to the beat! The trick is
knowing how quickly the ball is
coming at you. Good Luck!"

Personal description: Oh, trust
me, you'll need that luck for
this one if you haven't seen any
videos of this ones gameplay.
So, you're a blue rectangular
like guy with another similar
guy. Both of you are going to a
ping pong match. This whole
thing is flick central and you
need to know how to react fast.
There's a normal pass, a slow
pass, and a quick pass. Both the
normal a slow passes have no
audio cues, since the former is
the one being used most
throughout the whole game and
the latter is slow enough that
you can catch it. The fast one,
however is too fast, and no
human could possible know when
to do it if it's their first
time playing. Thus, there's an
audio cue of a cow bell,
somewhat in the background,
something like "Tonk tink tonk."
The speed of the audio cue will
be how fast the ping pong ball
will go.


Personal thoughts: It's two of
the Cosmic Dancers! If you
didn't know, these two guys are
from the original Rhythm
Tengoku.

The tutorial is nice and slow so
you can get use to the timing.
But the main game has a fairly
fast tempo and the fast pass is
possibly too fast. Not
memorizing it beforehand will
cause many problems for you.


Order of patterns:
1 slow pass
3 normal passes
1 fast pass
3 normal passes

Right or Wrong: Spot on!: You
pass the ping-pong ball nicely
back to your rally partner.

Just barely: The ball will be
sent off to the side, making a
"BOING" sound, being either hit
too early or too late.

Missed: The ball will pass right
by you.


Tips for Superb: Well, like I
said, I guess memorization is
possibly one of the better
things to. Well, it worked for
me. I'm not sure about anything
else though. It's either you
have fast reflexes or you don't.
If anyone else has a tip for
this besdies memorization,

Shoot-'Em-Up....................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Invasion
alert! Invasion alert! Scramble
fighters, STAT! Or... practice
first, and then scramble.
Whatever works for you."


Personal description: This game
involves you in a fighter ship
in space, and you need to shoot
the alien attackers with timed
shots! It's not really that
hard, it's like "Simon says,"
where it will give out the
pattern first then you must
repeat it, only making them
explode, not making them come
in. Shooting is a simple tap on
the screen. That's all there is
to it, and it really shouldn't
be too hard.


Personal thoughts: Really. It
shouldn't be hard. I really do
like this one though. It's such
a catchy tune, don't ya think?
Well, whatever.

Right or Wrong: Spot on!: The

satisfaction.

Just barely: The alien will
actually be charred black and
swerve off screen to either of
the sides, but still intact.

Missed: The alien will hit,
making your ship make an alter
sound and the screen flashes red
for a brief moment.


Tips for Superb: If it helps,
and it certainly helps me
sometimes, tap along off screen
with the aliens as they create
the pattern for you then there's
a better chance you understand
the pattern and when to tap the
screen.


Extra Tips for Perfect: I wanted
to hold this one out for this,
since it can apply to both
Superb and Perfect runs.

You see, when you're spot on
with the timing, you'll make
them explode, right? Well, then
there's the time when you hit
them, but they swerve off
screen. Makes you think you
screwed up, right? Wrong. In a
perfect run, doing such a thing
will not cause you to fail that
perfect run. Only if you miss
the alien altogether will it
count as a mistake. Hope that
helps for the people who don't
know.

Another interesting tip. You can
tap whenever you want during the
entire game and it won't count
as a miss. If you weel the need
to hear the blaster and not the
tapping of plastic against
plastic, you can tap on the
touch screen. I'd advise not to
try and copy the 8 volly shots
exactly. Just tap to the beat
then actually shoot the 8 volly
aliens.

In-game message: "The captain
might seem a little intense.
He'll get mad if you mess up,
but just let it roll off you
like water off a duck's back."


Personal description: So, it
looks like you're a... well,
some kind of bird with, what
looks like, a beret. You're the
last bird in a row of 3. But
that doesn't matter. What does
matter is you following that
little bird's orders. He's the
captain, regardless of what you
think of his high-pitched voice
and small stature. He. Is. The
captain. When he says "Peck your
beak," then you must tap thrice
on the touch screen. When he
says "Stretch out your neck,"
you must tap and hold then flick
with the right timing.


Personal thoughts: The only
thing that seems like it'd be
dificult to bare with is the
tempo of this game. Maybe, I
have no clue. I personally
didn't have too much trouble on
this one to be honest.


Order of patterns:
"Stretch out your neck"

Right or Wrong: Spot on!:
Everything looks in order here.

Missed: When your peck you
beeak, it'll make a "BOING"
sound instead and the captain
will fume he gets that angry.
When you stretch out your neck,
it looks like you get a cramp
while you do it. Ouch. These OR
if you do any of these commands
without your captain's say so,
he'll also get angry.


Tips for Superb: Just make sure
you're not too early on your
"pecks," since it seems more
strict for early taps then later
taps, but that just might be me.

In-game message: "Little known
fact: when no one's watching,
moai love to sing. Repeating the
first one's phrasing take a
light touch and good timing."


Personal description: Oh, how
they couldn't have worded it
better then myself. Well... than
again, I'm pretty bad at wording
things. Uh, anyway! You are the
moai on the right hand side (the
one with the bow if you're not
sure). These Easter Island heads
have the right sense of rhythm,
and so must you. To do a
standard "Doo-wop," you have to
tap and hold your stylus on the
touch screen to make a "Doo...",
until you release, ending it
with a "...wop." But now for
that short "WOP!" they make,
it's a simple tap. Doo-wop, doo-
wop, dooooo-wop. WOP! WOP!
*smacked*


Personal thoughts: This one is
pretty evil to do. Even though I
would consider myself to have
some rhythmical endowment, it
was still annoying to do.
Luckily, it's not extremely
long. I think the general
concept is pretty funny.
Anyway...


Order of patterns: "Doo-wop,

Right or Wrong: Spot on!:

Missed: Your friend will look at
you and a bird will poo on
you... great, eh?


Tips for Superb: Alright, so,
you may have some troubles, but
that's perfectly fine. Using my
method, this might help you.
Doing the same you did with
"Shoot-'Em-Up," tap off-screen
with the leader moai so you can
get a better feel for the
pattern you must do. It helped
me a bit.

Now, for another method that I
tried using, but it didn't help
me too much. I remember seeing
someone saying something like
"Look at the birds bobbing their
heads. This will help you get
the timing down," or something
like that. It's true, the birds
are bobbing their heads, and it
can be used for the timing, but
it was a real pain for me to
use, so I just stuck with my own
method and just listening, but
feel free to use this if you're
having trouble and my method
doesn't help you.


Extra Tips for Perfect: The
timing is, like Glee Club, a bit
picky in terms of starting the
"Doo" and ending with the "wop."
What a superb counts as fine,
perfect does not, so there's
that fine line of mistake and
perfect. Practice.

again, here we are with a remix,
this mix focusing only on the
past 4 games you played. And,
like it says, with a tropical

er, orange-ish and Hawaiian
like.


Persona thought: This is
probably the shortest remix out
of them all. Be happy about it.

Well, bad news is that the Moai
Doo-Wop has quite a few parts.
BUT, Rhythm Rallly only has,
like, one. So, you're only
getting one of the two hard ones
in this. Well, for me that is.
Blue Birds might not be your cup
of tea, but that one doesn't
have many parts either. Also,
the temop is rather slow, so if
you had some troubles in Rhythm
Rally, the speed wont kill you
this time.

Set 3...........................

Ah, the third set. I dodn't know
what to say about this set. I
guess it has a few games that I
enjoy quite a bit. I dunno about
you though, so we'll just wait
and see, shall we? Let's go!

--------------------------------
Love Lizards....................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "When two
lizards meet in the desert, they
communicate their feelings the
only way they know how!"


Personal description: Oh love,
you come up a few times in
Rhythm Heaven. Love Lizards has
it so you must copy the small,
aqua coloured male lizard as you
play as the big, yellow coloured
female. The male has a huge
maraca like tail, while you have
a thin, yet hard, tail, along
with a spiky back. Tapping and
holding the stylus on the touch
screen has it so your lizard put
her tail on her back. Sliding it
up and down will cause you to
have the tail rub your back,
making a... well, I'm not good
with instument names, but like a
wood stick on a wavy piece of
wood...? I dunno, if someone
could tell me what it's called,
I'll be glad to fix this.
ANYWAY, using this, you must
match the male's pattern of his
maraca tail. If I even need to
refer to the pattern, it's 4
slides, but I'll call it "a
set."


Personal thoughts: Well,
honestly, if people thought the
small lizard was the female,
think about nature for a second,
"Which one is usually bigger
when it comes to creatures like
this?" That's what I thought
once and and then I figured it
had to be the female you're
playing as. I'm mainly speaking
to the people who've played the
Japanese version.

Umm... now, onto the actual
thoughts about the gameplay of
this one. It's very repetitive,
but by all means, it's not bad.
I rather like it. Maybe because
it's so simple. That and it's
cute. Oh come on, admit it, you
think it's cute too.


Right or Wrong: Spot on!: The
male lizard will show his love,
blushing and a little heart will
appear beside his head.

Missed: The male lizard will
look displeased and will make a
sad kind of sound.


Tips for Superb: After the male
does his little dance, it's then
that you slide the stylus up and
down, not while he's doing the
dance. Also, I'd suggest that
you keep the stylus "on your
back" at all times, since some
of the audio cues might be a bit
sudden and you might screw up.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Ah,
another picky one, from my
experiences. If the timing is
fairly close to the male's,
it'll count as a screw up, but
like always, the male lizard
still makes a <3 sign even if a

Crop Stomp......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "It's harvest
time! It may seem like a weird
way to pluck beets, but it
works. Oh, and watch out for
moles!"


Personal description: So, you
control the Stomp Farmer, who,
you may have guessed, stomps.
What for? Well, to get those
beets out of the ground. Tapping
the screen with his voice will
make him stomp, forcing the
beets out of the ground. Wow,
that does seem a bit weird.
After the beets have shot out of
the ground, they wont just go
into your basket. Oh no, you
need to flick to hit them in.
Oh, and, like the in-game
message, you have to watch out
for those moles, those little...
They're heavier then beets
apparently so they don't fly up
as high when you stomp, so the
timing for the flick is much
faster, but it'll be worth it.


Personal thoughts: This one is
pretty interesting. There's a
cameo's from the original
Japanese game, which is cool.
Also, hitting the moles is fun,
since they go "BLEH!" as you
smack them in the face, sending
them off screen.

Anyway, this one is all about
the stomping, and for me, I
found it very fun, though I've
heard some people have had some
troubles with this one, which
isn't something I like to hear
since... well, I just said I
found it very fun.


Order of patterns:
8 beets
*pause*
1 beet
*pause*
28 beets
1 mole
3 beets
1 mole
3 beets
1 mole
3 beets
1 mole


Right or Wrong: Spot on!: You'll
get those beets in your basket
and smack those moles right off
the screen.

Just barely: You'll hit the beet
but it won't go into your basket
and the mole will just be turned
over.

Missed: You stomp them up but
you don't even hit them. Or
maybe you won't even hit them up
in the first place.


Tips for Superb: So, like I
said, stomping. It's a good
thing. When there's no beets
around, you should keep stomping
to keep you in "beet" (aha ha ha
I'm sorry...). This way when
you're getting back to the
beets, you won't be off...
"beet" (alright, I'll really
stop this time).


Extra Tips for Perfect: Nothing
much I can add onto here.
Maybe... try and memorize it a
little? Might help. But other
then that, practice!

In-game message: "Capture the
excitment of car racing on film!
There's a fortune to be made on
the racing circuit!"


Personal description: You are a
phtographer, as shown in the
lower, right-hand side of the
top screen. Being someone who
has a camera, it seems you can't
pass up any car that comes your
way, and you feel you have to
take a picture of every single
one. A simple tap is all it
takes to take a picture of a
race car. But, there are two
different kinds of race cars.
The small, normal ones, which
are slow enough that their audio
cue is while they're off screen.
Then there's the fast carrot
cars. Their audio cue is while
they're passing on screen, and
it's fast, so be prepared!


Personal toughts: I love this
one, since it's chalk full of
cameos, and anyone who's played
the original will see them right
away... I hope. But in any case,
this one doesn't require
flicking, so that's a good thing
for all those people who are
still having trouble with it.

nice and fast, well, mainly for

In-game message: "Snappy

Personal description: You are
the last girl on the right side
out of the 3 rows, starting from
top to bottom. There will be
various patterns that you'll
have to perform (and here I
thought I wouldn't need to put a
order of patterns for this
one...) , all of which end with
you and the girl beside you or
above you. The girls boxes above
you will turn dark, and you must
do the same when it gets to you
and the girl beside you. After
that, those patterns I was
telling you about kick in as you
use the flick command to strike
a pose and make a "shing" kinda
sound. Failing to do so will get
the other girls to look at you
funny... Stop looking at me like
that!


Personal thoughts: This one,
from my experiences, gave me a
little bit of trouble, but I'll
cover that in the tips. Aside
from that, the tempo is slow
enough so I don't think you'll
need your awesome reflex skills
for this one.


Order of patterns: "Shing shing
shing-shing shing shing" "Shing

"Shing shing shing" "Shing shing

"Shing shing shing" "Shing shing

"Shing, shing"


Tips for Superb: Now, this one
is kinda weird sometimes. It's
either you get the timing spot
on or slightly after you're
suppose to, never slightly
before. If you do it slightly
before, it'll count as a minor
mistake of just a big mistake in
general, from what's happened to
me a few times. So, if you're
like me and HAVE to get perfect
timing on it, until you really
get the use of flicking and it's
timing, I'd suggest you stick
with forcing yourself to wait a
fraction of a second after
you're suppose to, 'cause it
worked out fine with me when I
did that.

In-game description: "It's time

Personal description: I dunno
what the heck spaghetti western
means, but it certainly has a
very Japanese feel to it, maybe
even a old time Japan-like feel
to it? I dunno. But, In this
remix, everything is
extremely... well, I dunno how
to describe it other than
"dull," but that wouldn't be
right since it's still very
unique. Curse my horrible
vocabulary. Well, the only one
that didn't get this treatment
was the Freeze Frame parts; that
one is now boats instead of
cars.

Personal thoughts: Oh man, slow
tempo. This might get some of
you since it's kinda slow. The
Love Lizards parts are the only
parts that feel incredibly fast.
Maybe a few of The Dazzles
parts. Oh, for the order of
games thing, I'll still refer to
the Freeze parts as cars, even
though they're boats. Less of a
hassle for me.


Order of games: Love Lizards

Tips for Superb: Once again, all
depends on how well you nailed
down the original versions of
each part. However, since this
is a bit slower then almost all
of the original versions, try
tapping along with the beat.
That might help you out a bit.

Munchy Monk.....................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Your training
takes place deep in the
mountains. We call it monk
training, but it's really just
eating dumplings all day."


Personal description: So,
apparently, you're doing monk
training, but really, you just
eating multicoloured dumplings
everyday to a crazy tune. Yeah,
that's pretty much it. You got
some random guy putting
dumplings in your hand. This one
only uses the tap command, which
is you smacking your arm,
causing your hand to fling
whatever at his face. This also
has 3 different audio cues.
First one you learn is "One,
go!" A hand will put a single
white dumpling in you palm. On
the "go!" part, you need to tap.
Next is "Three! Go! Go! Go!"
This time a... different
coloured hand will give you... 3
green dumplings? In any case,
during each "go!", the hand will
give you a new dumping, so you
need to tap on each "go!" Final
one, and one that you'll
probably screw up on if you're
new to this, the "T-two! Go go!"
This one, is pretty much like
"One, go!" only you press it
twice, rather then once. The
time to press still starts at
the same time as the "One, go!"
cue, but just add in another
one.


Personal thoughts: I love how if
you listen to a gameplay video
of the actual game and then try
to do the practice, your timing
will be all screwy. Well, it was
for me and it took quite a few
tries to get it right before I
actually knew the timing for it.
Though this one is a bit fast,
so you might end up having to
try again on this one. Still,
one of my favourites.


Order of patterns:
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"Three! Go! Go! Go!"
"T-two! Go go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"

"T-two! Go go!"

"Three! Go! Go! Go!"
"One, go!"
"One, go!"
"Three! Go! Go! Go!"
"T-two! Go go!"
"One, go!"
"T-two! Go go!"


Tips for Superb: That list may
seem long, but it's pretty
short.

The whole thing is reflex
central. Get why I said it was
"pretty short?" It goes by fast,
so you really need to either get
a grip on the audio cues and the
tempo, or memorize it. Either
which way, both worked for me.

Also, to get a hang on those
double dumplings, if you're
really having trouble, don't try
and get them. Just let them
fall, but listen to when the guy
says "Go go!" Remember, if that
guys says "go!", it's your cue
to tap the touch screen.


Extra Tips for Perfect: So...
you think it tapping the screen
after it's done will cost you
your Perfect? Well, it won't. I
dunno why! Just be happy it
doesn't! Also, practice!

DJ School.......................

In-game message: "Pick up some
tips from DJ Yellow, and see if
can learn his patented move.
Scratch-o, hey!"


Personal description: So, you're
the blue, weird looking guy in
this one. It's a simple job you
need to do; tap and hold when
"DJ Yellow" says "Uh!" Now don't
let go. When the DJ says "Hey!",
that's when you flick, and look
really awesome. This has audio
cues, along with visual cues,
but it's better if you pay
attention to the audio then the
visuals. For the "Uh!" clip, it
will follow after either "Break!
Come on!" or "... And stop!" For
"Hey!", however, only has one
cue, being the ever so awesome
"Scratch-o!" And that's all
there is too it.


Personal thoughts: This on has
such catchy music. And,
personally, it's not too hard to
boot, so, big plus there. Also,
it makes a funny disk scratching
sound if you tap and hold, then
slide the stylus on the touch
screen. It's pretty interesting.


Tips for Superb: So, this is
another one that seems very
strict before the action
happens, but somewhat lenient
after the action happens, like
The Dazzles game. So, follow my
advice for that. It might be
little bit more strict in
general, but I'm not really
sure. In fact The Dazzles might
be more strict for all I know...

Drummer Duel....................

In-game message: "The red team's
pushed you around for long

who's got rhythm! Go, blue!"


Personal description: So, this
involves you being a taiko
drummer. Yeah, it's called a
taiko drum from my knowledge.
So, as it indicates, you are the
blue team, thus you're the blue
drummer. And you'll get a group
of 3 cheerlearders, fancy that.
This one requires a simple tap
on the touch screen. However,
don't underestimate it, as there
ends up being quite a few
patterns. These may help or not,
but a single hit is counted as a
"DON" while consecutive hits,
with this it's 3, are counted as
"DOKODON," with more "DOKO"'s
added in when needed"


Personal thoughts: Beinging
myself, I didn't find this very
hard to do, but again, that's
just me. I definitely love how
they didn't change any of the
background music either, keeping
in the "OSU!" and "Se no!" Love
it, it just keeps the feeling of
a taiko drum for some reason.
Could be because I've played
various other Japanese rhythm
games quite a bit.


Order of patterns:
"DON DON DON DON DON DON DON"
"DON DON DON DON DON DON DON"
"DON DON DON DON DON DOKODON"
"DON DOKODON DON DON DOKODON"
"DON DOKODON DOKODON DOKODON"
"DON DOKODOKODON DON DOKODON"

*speed up*
"DON DOKODOKODOKODOKODOKODON"
*speed up*
"DON DOKODOKODOKODOKODOKODON"
*slow down*
"DON DON DON DON DON DOKODON"


Tips for Superb: So having
toubles listening to the DONs
and DOKODONs and end up
miscounting them? Don't count
them. If you listen a little
harder, you'll hear a whistle
being blown each time the red
drummer hits the taiko drum. Try
and pay attention to those
whistle blows rather then the
DONs and DOKODONs. Trust me,
it'll help if you do. If
listening to the DONs and
DOKODONs helps you more then
listening to the whistle blows,
that's fine too. Also,
memorization can help out too.

Love Lab........................

In-game message: "The research

there aren't any accidents!"


Personal description: So, set in
an afternoon like appearance,
with the whole place with an
orange tint to it, you are the
female scientist next to the man
with blue glasses. The whole
concept is to make hearts via a
flask that is passed to you from
said man with glasses. You must
tap and hold to grab a flask
tossed to you, creating a heart.
Then you slide it up and down to
make more hearts and/or you toss
it on to the next person via the
flick. With this in mind, you
must copy what the guy with
glasses does. When he does these
things, the flask makes blue
hearts. IF you properly timed
each action to match the guys
actions, the two sides of
hearts, his blue, yours red,
will join together to make...
pick hearts. If I recall, blue
and red don't make pink... Er,
anyway, failure to grab the
flask being tossed to you will
cause it to fall and... break.
Failure to correctly mimic the
guy will cause all hearts that
weren't matched up side by side
to try and fuse together, only
to fail and disappear.


Personal thoughts: One of my
favourite games. It's so nice
and calm and it just has a
really nice, uplifting feeling,
you know? Well, whatever. This
one can possibly be quite hard,
being for the fact you have to
pretty much copy the timing of
the guy. I've heard this was
hard to do, but I've passed
through this one with easy.
Maybe you'll be like me?


Order of patterns: Grab, shake
shake toss Grab, toss Grab, toss
Grab, shake shake toss Grab,

toss Grab shake toss Grab toss
Grab shake shake, shake shake
toss Grab, toss Grab, toss Grab
shake shake, shake shake toss
Grab, toss Grab, toss Grab,
shake shake toss Grab, toss
Grab, toss Grab, toss


Tips for Superb: Well, it all
boils down to if you can copy
the guy's actions. Possibly what
I've told you do for Shoot-'Em-
Up and Moai Doo-Wop; do what the
guy does off-screen. Of course,
there's memorizing. Well, then
there's also getting a firm grip
on the actual commands. Nice,
holding the stylus on screen
until you need to flick, do big
slides to make it register the
shakes, and of course strong
flicks. May I note that one
shake is a slide up then down.
That's why it's advisable to put
your stylus down near the
"bottom" of the touch screen so
you'll have more room for the
slides.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Again, a
picky timer. Even if you get the
timing down right for a superb,
it might not fly with a perfect.
So just be weary about this.
However, I know it may be hard
to do this, but if you're like
me, you'll start to tense up a
little and end up screwing up
some part. TRY and stay calm.
Actually, that sounds like
something I should have just put

In-game message: "It's time to

Personal description: So, yeah,
romantic theme now. And what a
coincidence, there's a game with
the word "love" in it that does,
indeed, invlove romace and
whatnot. Love Lab and Munchy
Monk's backrounds have been
changed to stereotypical romance
places, THAT ARE CHILD FRIENDLY,
A.K.A. a picnic and carnival
respectively. DJ School and

edits to them, like changing
sublte things into hearts or
something like that.


Personal thoughts: I've noticed
how almost none of the games in
each remix had anything to do
with the theme presented. Kinda
weird. Er, anyway, This is
probably one of my favourite
remixes. It's most likely
because it has all the games I
really enjoy, besides a few that
aren't in this set.

For the sake of saving space,
I'll abbreviate the "Grab shake
toss" for Love Lab. It takes up
quite a bit of space. Also not
going to write out the whole

In-game message: "There's no I

Well, get out there anyway and

Personal description: So, from
the in-game message, it'd be
obvious that this was about
riding a bike... What'd you
expect? Seriously though, you're
the last swimmer in a row of 3
(well, that's certainly
original) and you have to copy
what the other swimmers do. That
said, it can still be tricky.
The main thing about this one is
you have to go underwater, via
tapping and holding the stylus
on the touch screen. Now you
either need to lift or flick, a
lift making your swimmer come
back up, while a flick makes
them jump out of the water with
a dolphin. Along with the flick
command, you must either follow
the other swimmer as the last
one in the row or when the crowd
"woooooah!", all three swimmers
must jump out with a dolphin,
A.K.A. you have flick when the
crowd does that.


Personal thoughts: I dunno what
to think of this one. I found it
easy though. This is pretty
slow, so none of the cues caught
me off guard. And to add on,
this one has some pretty cool
music.


Tips for Superb: Not entirely
sure for this one, but this game
doesn't have any of the "barely-
made-it" kinda things, so it's
either you get it or you don't.

to strum, the guitar 4 times,
but like I said, with the green
ghost. Successful, the green
ghost will say "Thank you." and
the next song will play. Fail
horribly, the green ghost will
just go "Ahem..." and move on.


Personal thoughts: This one is
totally random. More on that in
the tips section. I do like
this, however, and it has an
interesting feel to it. I mean,
really. Ghosts playing in a
band. How often do you see that?


Tips for Superb: Alright, now,
this one is completely random.
Why? Well, in the tutorial, you
play the first and last songs of
this game. While you at least
know when it starts and when it
will end, there is no way to
predict what song will come up
next, besides the first and last
ones. So this one requires a bit
of relex training.

EDIT: I was wrong about that.
Sorry guys. It does, in fact,
signify that you got a part
wrong if you think you didn't.
When he says "Thank you." in a
half- hearted kind of voice,
that's when you know you've
screwed up somewhere in that one
song. HOWEVER! You can still get
a superb and, in turn, a perfect
with it being slightly off and
the green ghost saying it in
half-hearted kind of way.

Extra Tips on Perfect: So, yet
another picky one. But here's
something for you; you don't
have to copy what the green
ghost does EXACTLY the way he
does it. Even though he strums
then quickly goes to ready for
the next strum, you don't have
to do that. All you need to make
sure is that you strum when he
does. That's all. (EDIT:
Confrimed. This is a fact.)

In-game message: "Ninjas rock.
They can cut through, like,

Personal description: Ah, the
life of a ninja. Too bad he's
reduced to cutting vegetables.
Well, this ninja is a dog! Tell
me, how often do you see a dog
ninja? Often? What do you mean?
Where do you live? Er, anyway,
this game has it so you must
cut, as I said, vegetables, via
the flick command. Well...
that's just about it. Nothing
too complicating about this one,
though I suppose you people who
are having trouble with this
game should be happy.


Personal thoughts: I was sad
that there wasn't anything more
other then normal, on-beat
slices, then the off-beat
slices. Ain't exactly good thing
since this is one of my
favourites I kinda wanted a
little more challange to it.


Tips for Superb: Some
memorization might be in need
for this one. Either that, or
you having good reflex skills.
Either which one works fine.
Other then that, I don't know
what else to say to help you
with this one.

Frog Hop........................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "These frogs
really tear up the stage, but
what really sells it are the
backup dancers! Dance away, and
set that stage on fire!"


Personal description: Well, it's
a good thing you can't really
set the stage on fire,
otherwise, it'd be fried frong
tonight!... ... anyway... You're
a set of 4 backup dancers in
some frog... band? I have no
clue. In any case, you got the
lead singer and a female
upfront, while there's you and
three other backup dancers in
the back. Being a dancer in
general mean constant movement,
for the most part, so from start
to finish, you must tap the
screen in beat, as to not get
get by the other backup dancers.
Along with the constant tapping
of the screen, there's three
audio cues you must know. First
is the "Yahoo!" This is where
you tap twice, where the second
tap ends off-beat. Then there's
"Yeah yeah yeah" which is three
taps in a row. Finally is "Spin
it boys!" where you must tap and
hold then flick to do a spin.
Lots to do, I know, but bare
with me.


Personal thoughts: TOO LONG!
Yes, this is like a full fledged
song you're playing to, so it's
long and tedious. Besides that,
it's a pretty catchy song and
the whole high-pitched voice is
funny sounding too.


Order of patterns:
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yeah yeah yeah"
"Spin it boys!"
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yahoo"
"Yeah yeah yeah"

"Spin it boys!"
"Yahoo"

"Spin it boys!"


Tips for Superb: Ugh, long games
are long. Keep trucking at it
though. This one is slow enough,
for me, that I can rely pretty
much on the audio cues. But just
remember, don't stop the
constant on-beat tapping. If you
do, you'll be doomed to do this
one again and again and again.
And memorization would be a pain
to do for this, but if it will
help you, by all means, go for
it.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Now,
this one is one of lesser strict
ones I was talking about with
Shoot-'Em-Up. Since you have to
constantly tap, making a
"barely-got-it" tap, with the
frog making sweat marks, will
still bag you a perfect. I mean
really, who can honestly get a
perfect on this without the help
of the lenient perfect for this
one? Well... maybe some of those
hardcore gamers out there, but
not me, that's for sure. So,
remember, this one is lenient.

Also, thank the heavens that
after it's done, you can't tap
anymore, so if you take the
extra tap by mistake after it's
done, it won't count. Heck, it
doesn't even register.

Remix 5.........................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "It's time to

piece, full of energy and fun.
(And no practice for you!)


Personal description: I dunno
what this theme is suppose to be
for this one. Hopever, there
seems to be a crowd in every one
of these in this remix, so...
I'm not sure. A puplic theme?
Crowd theme? I have no clue.


Persona thoughts: Nothing much
to say other then it's got an
interesting tune... yeah...
nothing else comes to mind
really.

Oh right. Dog Ninja has an audio
cue for this remix for some
reason. It's "Here we go!" Yeah,
not sure why either. I'll also
type out "..." for frog hop if
all you do is tap for the
constant beat. And for Big Rock
Finish, I type out "# end" for
the 4 strum finish. Since
Splashdown requires you to be
underwater first, I'll type out
what you need to do after you
tap and hold.


Order of games: Frog Hop (...)
Dog Ninja (1 slice) Big Rock
Finish (1 end) Splashdown (1
lift, 1 flick") Dog Ninja (1
slice) Frog Hop (3 "Spin it
boys!") Dog Ninja (1 slice) Big

Fog Hop (3 "Yeah yeah yeah") Dog
Ninja (1 slice) Big Rock Finish
(1 end) Splashdown (2 flicks)
Dog Ninja (3 slices) Fog Hop (1
"Spin it boys!")


Tips for Superb: Alright, I lied
about not knowing why Dog Ninja
had an audio cue. It's to notify
you that it's the Dog Ninja
game. Why? It's because the Dog
Ninja game comes after Fog Hop
and Splashdown fast, so it needs
to tell you some how that it's
no longer Frog Hop or Splashdown
or to warn you you need to make
a slice soon.

Nothing else comes to mind,
besides nailing down the
original versions of each of the
games.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Well,
since this ends with Frog Hop,
I'll say this: you can still tap
after it's done! Probablky
because you didn't have to
constantly tap for the last
part. So... yeah, other then
that... Practice!

Space Soccer....................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Don't drop the
ball! It takes some crafty
legwork to keep that thing in
the air! Kick, kick, kick!"


Personal description: Well, that
the message says is true. Have
you ever tries playing keep-up
with a soccer ball? I haven't...
um, but that's not point. You're
some... guy in a pale purple
suit on a flying... something.
I'm not quite sure what. You
must keep the soccer ball up by
tapping the screen in beat with
the music. When you hear the guy
say "High!" the ball will fly
out away from the normal tapping
range, thus you must tap then
flick on the off-beat to make
his kick it with a "Kick O!"...
wait, or is it "Kick toe!"?
Whatever. That's it.


Personal thoughts: Catchy song.
And the whole thing is just
random. It's a guy on a flying
platform, playing keep-up.

In other news, I didn't find
this one too hard. But like
always, it may be harder for
others.


Tips for Superb: Remember, to
hit it when the guy says "High!"
is when you need to tap and hold
the stylus then flick and that
the flick is off beat. This all
happens somewhat fast, so
practice is in order. Go through
the tutorial a few times if you
can't get it right.


Extra Tip for Perfect: Well,
here's something interesting.
All you need to do is hit the
ball so it doesn't fall. The
interesting part is that you may
be pretty much off but just
barely hit the ball back up.
Yeah, I think this is another
lenient one, but since there's
no actual sign of a "barely-
made-it" kinda thing in this
one, I can't say for sure. But
yeah, as long as you hit it,
from my knowledge, you'll still
get it.

Lockstep........................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "This one's all
about hitting the beat, flipping
it, and then nailing the
backbeat. Experience both sides
of the rhythm!"


Personal description: Being one
of possibly thousands of these
black and white guys, you must
tap in time with the beat then
flip it to tap with the
backbeat, as these guys call it.
There are obviously audio cues
when to switch between the two
beats. Going from "Hai, hai,
hai, hai-Ah! Ah, ah, ah..." is
switching from the main beat to
the backbeat. And the "Hm ha hm
ha hai, hai, hai..." is
switching back to the main beat.
Yeah, sounds simple doesn't it?


Personal thoughts: I love this
one and how easy it is. However,
until you get a good grasp of
it, you might think it's pretty
hard. Don't worry about it. Just
keep practicing on this and
you'll learn to love it... I
hope.


Tips for Superb: This one is all
about nailing the backbeat
tapping and the switching. I
don't have much advice for this
besides just keep practicing it
until you get it.

I did, however, see this piece
of advice on the boards once. It
went something like this, "I'd
suggest you don't play with your
headphones on. Hearing yourself
tap the screen may help you with
the timing." To me, this
actually makes sense and it does
help you grasp the beat a little
better then not hearing your
taps.

Now, here's something that just
occured to me. One of my friends
has been having some trouble
with it. More specifically, the
part were you switch to the
backbeat and back constantly and
in rapid succession. Now, as sad
as it may sound, there's little
I can do to help you with this.
I really don't know anything
else besides getting a firm
grasp on the switches between
the offbeat and back.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Being
another one of the few lenient
ones, as long as you're close to
the timing, you're alright. The
"barely-made-it" for this is you
still make the animation, you
just don't make a marching
sound, but instead you make
that... sound... I dunno what to
call it. But yeah. As long as
you aren't out of line, you're
fine (hey, it rhythmed :D).

Also, if you'll look to the P at
the end of the run, you'll
notice that those extra taps
near the end don't count since
the P doesn't light up when you
tap. You may choose to stop and
rest a little and bask in you
perefct get, or keep tapping,
just to be sure.

Rockers.........................

In-game message: "Nothing says

Personal description: So, played
enough Guitar Hero? Good, 'cause
now you get to play another kind
of guitar game. Being a disciple
of another guitarist, you must
follow his lead, via copying
whatever he does after he does
it, like "Simon says." Wow, a
lot of games have a "Simon says"
feel to them, don't they? Er,
anyway, strumming the guitar is
just like in Big Rock Finish.
Along with that, you can also
mute the chords, which is
actually a requirement, so don't
forget to mute them now at the
same point your higher up did.


Personal thoughts: Another
guitar game you don't need to
know how to play the guitar to
play. Hurray. Well, I like the
music in this one, since it's
all upbeat and stuff. Besides
that...

... is that a guy or a girl?
Honestly, I can't tell. I mean,
it's probably a guy, but just
the general appearance of that
character you play is just looks
really girly. Not like that's a
bad thing, I'm just saying.
Anyway...


Tips for Superb: If it helps,
keep your stylus on the touch
screen at all times and
strum/mute the chords when you
need to. I don't really do that,
but if it helps you, then go for
it.

Also, nodding your head, tapping
your foot or whatever to count
the number of beats before the
"master" mutes the chords might
help you.


Extra Tips for Perfect: I think
this one is one of the stirct
ones where if you're slightly
off and a superb would count it
alright, the perfect will not.
So, you just have to...

Karate Man......................

In-game message: "Who knew
karate training could be so
brutal? A punch will take care
of most things, but those bombs
call for a solid kick!"


Personal description: ... If you
do not know who this is, you
have never played the original
game and I weep for you. This
karate man is out in training in
what appears to be a dark snowy
night. Funny, since the song is
actually about rain, not snow,
but whatever. And you must tap
the touch screen to make him
punch away most things that come
his way. However, like the in-
game message says, you have to
kick away the bombs, which start
out in barrels. To kick, you
much tap and hold to ready the
karate man. Then it's a simple
flick to kick. The barrel has an
audio cue of "Punch, Kick!"
There's also another audio cue
which would be "... hit 3!"
which will send out 3 things in
succession, to the beat of
course.


Personal thoughts: Man, I love
this one, but at the same time,
I hate it. I'm not sure why
either... Either way, it's just
so nice to see this guy return.
And shame on anyone who doesn't
know this guy. He pretty much
the best character in this
entire game. Alright, not for
everyone, but you know, he's
pretty cool.


Tips for Superb: So, this one
has a average tempo. Since I'm
more of a speed kinda guy, I
found this to be kinda hard.
Just make sure you tap a beat
after a pot comes out, since
that's the timing to hit it.

If you didn't go through with
the tutorial, I'll tell you
here. Pay attention to what
you're hitting exactly. Pots are
just normal, so nothing special.
Lightbulbs, however is the thing
right before a barrel, A.K.A. a
bomb, A.K.A. get ready for a
flick. If you're relying only on
hearing, due to closing your
eyes, you'll here a much
different sound then the pots
make when you hit them and when
they're sent out. Pots make a
"PSHEW!" kinda noise when they
come out. Lightbulbs make a
"TONK!" kinda noise... Hey, stop
laughing! I'm trying to help
here!

Here's something for all you
visual guys 'n gals out there.
If you look at the shadows of
each thing, when it gets a
little bit past the karate man's
right foot, tap then. If my
description to hit is off, tell
me and I'll tweak this part for
the sake of not screwing over
visual people.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Little
extra just in case you think
you've screwed up. If you
accidentally tap at the wrong
moment, like in between pots, it
won't count this as a mistake.
I'm not sure though, since it's
rarely ever happened to me, and
I wasn't really paying attention
to it if it was a perfect or
not. So some confirmation would
be very nice.

Remix 6.........................

In-game message: "It's time to

sort of spacey feel to it. (And
no practice for you!)


Personal description: Well, I
guess it does have a "spacey"
feel to it... but it feels like
this has more of a "'80's" feel
to it. Since, you know, the
karate man has a mullet, Space
Soccer guy has an afro, and so
on. Other then that, just like
every other remix, the actual
game parts play the same.


Personal thoughts: Just like
karate man, I love this one, but
hate it as well. However, I
actually know why. It's 'cause
of the transitions between some
of the games. More on that in
the tips sections...

Since this one has 2 games that
require constant tapping to the
beat, I'll put a "..." if that's
all you need to do for it. And
I'll put down "S/OffB" or
"S/OnB" for the switches for
Lockstep.

Tips on Superb: Well, I'd say
the same things I would for the
past remixes, however! This one
actually has some parts that are
very annoying and might make you
go "wtf?!" See, the transitions
between Space Soccer and
Lockstep are annoying. Why?
Simple, you can totally miss the
first tap on Lockstep due to how
close the trasition is to the
tap. So here's how to solve it.
Since Space Soccer can deal with
"as long as it hits" kinda
thing, tap slightly later then
you normally would. And I really
do mean slightly. This will
solve you missing the first tap
on Lockstep and then you can go
back to you normal tapping
style. It doesn't help that this
remix has a ton of those kinds
of transitions though, so
yeah...


Extra Tips for Perfect: What
else can I say other then that
extremely helpful tip on that
transition there? Practice!
Especially that tip I told you
since it can be hard to do that.
That is, unless your timing is
spot on...

"Airboarder"/Credits/Cast.......
................................
........(CRDTG)
--------------------------------

I told you the credits are here!

EDIT: ACTUALLY, this game has it
so your first run through...
isn't actually the game. It's
pre-played, so you don't have to
do anything during your first
play through it. It is AFTER you
watch it and the credits button
becomes available to you is when
you can actually play the game.

Also, this game is called
Airboarder.

Personal description: So, you've
got a spiffy looking hoverboard,
or an airboard, I guess it would
be called. You're the last in a
line of 3 airboarders. It's
simple. There are stacked blocks
and you have to duck and jump
over them. Ducking is as simple
as tapping the screen. Jumping
requires you to tap and hold.
You will tap and hold at high
blocks first, not matter whar.
Then when you get to low blocks,
you have to flick to jump over
them. Careful though, don't make
them fall over.


Personal thoughts: I love this
song. It's my favourite in the
whole game, Love Lab's song
following close behind. However
the timing is a bit picky. Now,
since this is the credits, there
will obviously be credit
appearing.


Tips for Superb: Well, there's
not much I can say to help. This
one is kinda fast, so your
reflexes better be nice and
honed now. If not, the first guy
will usually go "Tei!" then
duck, giving you a 3 beats
before you need to duck.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Now, I'd
love to say "Practice!" but in
reality, this doesn't actually
count as a normal game like the
rest. This is just something for
fun they added in. But,
something just tells me you
should at least become decent at
it... I'm not sure why... just
trust me on this though,
alright?

Set 7...........................
--------------------------------

So, now your Scroll Button has
evolved into... a better scroll
button! Yeah, that's pretty much
it. If you've noitced, there are
now 4 more columns for you to
play in, meaning more games! Too
bad they're only harder versions
of previous games. Still, some
will prove to be challenging, so
don't think this will be an
absolutly cake walk compared to
when you first started out.
There's a reason why I called
them a harder version. Also,
this should go without saying,
all tips I gave out in the first
version of each game should
pretty much apply into the
second harder version.

--------------------------------
Built to Scale 2................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Whatever these
things are, people want 'em! We
need to up our production! (And
no practice for you!)"


Personal description: So, this
is the harder version of Built
to Scale. Appropriate, don't you
think? The first game is now the
first hard version. Everything
is the same, unless you take
into the account of colours and
some of the timing. This being
that Built to Scale 2 has more
faster plates of metal,
sometimes, it almost seems
random! And with no practice,
you'll just have to rely on you
reflexes. Well, other then that,
nothing else has changed.


Persona thoughts I like this one
more because it serves more of a
challenge to me. Also, faster
things seem easier for me, for
the most part.


Tips for Superb: Can't say much
else, since this one is pretty
much the same, bar the faster
metal plates. You'll be flicking
a lot more in this one then in
the first one, so don't go all
crazy about it.

Also note that the dark part
won't be the spotlight anymore.
It will go dark, but after a
single, fast metal plate comes
by, the lights will turn back on
so for all those visual people,
you should be happy.

Personal description: Well, The
Dazzles are back and ready for
another performance. What's
different this time? I guess
it's the fact that it now seems
like they're in a field of
flowers or something. Heck, even
their new clothes look like
those white dresses girls wear
when it's all happy fun times in
the field of flowers and blah
blah blah. The Dazzles certainly
do intoduce new patterns to
their show and you can't
practice them, so you'll have to
learn it on the go. I'm sure
that if you managed the first
Dazzles well, you shouldn't be
hindered by this one by much.

Frog Hop 2......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Today, we're

no practice for you!)


Personal description: If you
thought the first version was
long, allow me to introduce the
harder version. It's cruel, yes
I know. Let it all out.
*smacked* Any case, Frog Hop 2
is indeed harder because of it's
longer playtime, accompanied by
a faster tempo. Besides that,
just like the other harder
versions so far, it sports
slighlty different graphical
changes, all the frogs now
getting snazzy hats and are
wearing clothing that cover more
then their lower half. Too bad
this one doesn't have the
singing voice. I would have
liked that. Aside from that, no
new commands are used.


Personal thoughts: Long. Yup.
Also, this thing loves to trick
you, but I'll say that in the
tips section:

Order of patterns: Umm... Uh...
no way in heck am I doing this
the way I have been for the
other games. This is too long
for me to do otherwise. Could
someone post up a gameplay of
this one? It'd help me a ton for
doing this one. If you do,
e-mail me the link to the video.
Thanks.


Tips for Superb: If you're not
paying attention near the end,
it will trick you into believing
it will stop at a certain point.
The music SOUNDS like the game
is going to end, but it will
actually keep going. It will do
this to you twice, from my
memory. So be cautious as to
when you think it will stop.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Taking
the advice I gave you would be
really good. Also, memorize how
many times it will do that music
trick on you before it really
ends. This will, without a
doubt, help you get a perfect.

Fan Club 2......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Looks like our
little pop idol's career has
taken off, and her superfans
couldn't be any happier! They've
pulled out all the stops this
time!"


Personal description: So, now
the second version of Fan Club.
So, why did it not say "(And no
practice for you!)"? Well,
that's because you need to learn
a new command for this one.
Along with the repeated 3 words
and "I suppose," the monkey's
now go "Ooooh!" followed by two
claps. The first clap is
actually on an off-
beat/backbeat, whatever. Other
then that, it's longer. Oh and
the second verse of the song has
"wonderful" instead of "I
suppose."


Personal thoughts: I dunno what
to say now. I guess I like the
song. I do like this version
over the original, since it's
longer but still easy.


Order of patterns:
"Yeah yeah yeah"
"Ooooh!"
"I suppose"
"Ooooh!"
"Hocus hocus hocus"
"Ooooh!"
"I suppose"
"Boom boom boom"
"I suppose"

"Yeah yeah yeah"
"Ooooh!"
"Yeah yeah yeah"

"Ooooh!"
"Yeah yeah yeah"
"Ooooh!"
"Wonderful"
"Ooooh!"
"Love you, love you, love you"
"Ooooh!"
"Wonderful"
"Boom boom boom"
"Wonderful"
"Love you, love you, love you"
"Wonderful"
"Yeah yeah yeah"
*other monkeys start to clap. yo


Tips on Superb: Well, do those
"Ooooh!" parts get you? Well,
here's a helpful tip that worked
for me. When they start the
"Ooooh!", there will 3 beats
before they clap. Right after
the 3 beat, do a tap then and
again on the 4th beat. So it'd
be like this: (b b btt) where b
= a beat and t = a tap.

UNlike it's predecessor, Fan
Club 2 is a little more lenient
on this regard, so don't worry
if you make a mistake. Two might
be pushing it, I'm not sure.

In-game message: "It's time to

Personal description: Well, at
least now you'll know thanks to
this. Well, this has a bunch of
various games in this one, and
this remix sports a guitar theme
along with a cloud theme. At
least, that's what it looks
like.


Personal thoughts: I like remix
since it's the first one of the
harder set of games.
Surprisingly, I didn't find this
one very hard. The only hard
parts for me were the "Ooooh!"
via the Fan Club parts and it
was only sometimes, but other
then that it was almost like a

Tips for Superb: Blerg. Too many
"Ooooh!"s for my taste. Still, I
don't think it should be too
hard if you follow my advice for
those "Ooooh!"s. Also, Frog Hop
doesn't have it so you have to
constantly tap with the beat for
this one, so be happy. Not much
else I can really say about this
one, other then maybe revisiting
the original individual versions
for each game just so you have a
firm grasp on what you have to
do for them.

Oh set 8, why do you have to be

right?). Set 8 has potentially
hard games. But really, I think
it all just depends on who's

Rhythm Rally 2..................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "This is high-
power table tennis, not for the
faint of heart. If you want to
win, you'll have to master the
high-speed rally!"


Personal description: Rhythm
Rally lives up to being the
harder version of the original
by being even harder. So, this
time, it takes palce in outer
space. The table is on a... UFO?
Well, whatever works I guess.
This is a bit faster then the
original and it also switches
angles every now and then, which
could distract you, depending on
who you are. For a harder
version, to make it hader,
there's a new thing you have to
learn, you even read the name of
it in the in-game message: high-
speed rally. The high-speed
rally is pretty much a sting of
fast passes that stretches on
for 4 hits. Something like "Tonk
tink tonk tink tonk tink tonk
tink." Other then that, it plays
the same.


Personal thoughts: I liked the
original music, but this is
pretty cool too. Also, snazzy
glow effect from the UFO. I also
like how it tries to screw with
you by changing the angles. I
think it give me a better view
of models :3 *smacked*

Tips for Superb: Alright, if you

back to the first one and see
how well you do now. If you're
not doing so well now, I'm sorry
to say, but... this one will
give you a heck of a time.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Well,
near the end, you'll hear some
weird noise, almost like someone
hitting the inside of a metal
barrel with a stick several
times. When this happens, the
techno beat will disappear and
you need to rely on you own
inner beat to hit the next one
before it come back. Other then
that, practice!

Fillbots 2......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "Orders are
through the roof! I hope you
don't mind pulling some
overtime..."


Personal description: And again,
Rhythm Heaven manages to make a
somewhat hard one harder.
Fillbots 2 has it so it's longer
and you have a new kind of robot
to fuel up. This new bot will
only take half the beats to fill
a normal one, 2 beats for those
who can't be bothered to actuall
think at the moment. Other then
that, there's the "night time"
shifts you have to work in. This
being the whole screen, except
for the robot's eyes and the
little SFX of their building
process, is black, thus
rendering the visuals usless. It
does, however, show you how much
fuel you've pumped into the
robot, but it's still harder to
do visuall then rhythmically.
There's also more to the whole
offbeat fuel-ups.


Personal thoughts: Really
tedious if you screw up near the
end since it's a long one. This
one was fairly easy once you get
the hang of it. To me anyway.
Could be others who just have
heck with this one, I'm sure of
it.

Order of patterns:
Coming soon!


Tips for Superb: Well this one,
it's better if you tap your foot
for the robot fueling beats. Tap
your foot, nod your head,
whatever works for you without
looking like a complete idiot to
others who might glance at you.
*smacked*

Also, "night shifts," you
shouldn't really be relying on
your eyes in the first place,
but you really shouldn't on
these parts since you have next
to zero idea where the top is to
each robot. Fueling them up via
visuals will be hard.

Two any mistakes at near the
end, you should just quit and
save yourself a few extra
seconds and get right back into
it rather then see a "Just OK"
rank. Really, you'll might see
it a few times bafore you get
this.


Extra Tips for Perfect: Now,
here's how this can help if you
didn't notice this. Each robot
makes it's own pitch of building
sound FXs. The skinny one has
the average pitch. The fat ones
have a lowered pitch. And
obviously the small ones have a
higher pitch. Other then that...
uh... practice?

Russian feeling. No? It doesn't?
Whatever. You're wearing a
different hat, which... the name
of the hat escapes me. It's also
snowing. Wonderful. Other then
that, the music is indeed a
little bit faster then the
original and includes more pecks
and stretches, but it doesn't
add much to the Blue Birds game.


Personal thoughts: I dunno. I

awesome finish and just the

Personal description: So the
Stepswitchers are back for more,
this time they're coloured white
and blue... Hmm, that don't seem
under the weather though. The
whole hasn't really been
changed, like other harder
version, and this one... well,
the song is slower but it has a
jazzy kind of feel to it, in
which the timing for coming back
to the normal beat is very fast
while the the timing for going
to the backbeat is a tad slow.
Just see for yourself.


Personal thoughts: I've heard a
ton of people say this is easier
then the original. It's mostly
because it's slower and if
you've perfected the original
with ease, then this version
will hardly make you panic. I
think it makes sense. Still,
some people might struggle with
this, so don't think it's easy
for you while it may be hard for
others.

Tips for Superb: I can't really

Personal description: This

This changes to different things

fast. Speed, speed. And guess
what? It's gets faster near the
end! Doesn't that sound great?


Personal thoughts: In a sense,
this could actually be harder
then the 10th remix simply
because it's so fast and it
gives you little to no time to
react to the changes and then
throws a command at you so fast,
you'll be hit in the face if you
have no prior knowledge of how
fast the transitions are.
Alright, maybe I'm exaggerating
a little too much, but it really
does go fast and it will
probably catch you off guard the
first few times you play it.

overall colour is no longer a
cold blue, but rather a red
colour. Maybe he's in a volcano?

Space Soccer 2..................

In-game message: "After a change
of song and a change of

Enjoy! (And no practice for

Personal description: Well, say
they said, the guy from Space
Soccer is back! Though, they
could have said "Space Kicker,"
since that's the name they game
him... Anyway, this version has
it as a western kind of theme,
so yeah. I know, you like the
other one better, deal with it.
I don't think the tempo is
faster, but it is slightly
longer then the first one. It
involves more "Kick toe!"s too.


Personal thoughts: I think a lot
of people like the original
version of this song, and I'm
with those people. Even if what
I heard was imaginary, I still
think the original sounded much
better then this one. But in any
case, I didn't find this one too
hard. You might be surprised
near the end, but whatever.
You'll adapt soon enough.


Tips for Superb: Well, just keep
the beat going and becareful of
those "Kick toe!"s near the end.
Nothing much to say beyond
that...

Other then that, it's equal in

aside, this one is just
Splashdown with more lifts and

different, maybe even slightly
faster in tempo. No new commands
so nothing to worry about it.


Personal thoughts: Didn't like
this one since it pulls a fast
one on you every once and
awhile. Still... you'll get use
to it.


Tips for Superb: Well, there's
one part that it really pulls a
fast one on you. It's right
after a flick. RIGHT when you
get back into the water, they
start to go under, which will
completely catch you off gurad
if you don't have sharp reflexes
go under with the beat they were
going to. It's a bit tricky, but
once you get the spot for it,
it'll stick to you for a while,
so just watch out for that one
part as it will kill your superb

(And no practice for you!)


Personal description: So the
dumpling eat monk is back and in
the circus. Must be a pretty
interesting circus to have
elephants playing brass
instruments. Still, that doesn't
the fact you still eat
dumplings. The length has been
increased and the speed seems to
have been kicked up slightly.
The good thing is that there's
no new dumplings you need to
worry about.


Personal thoughts: I like this
version of the song, all thanks
to the guitar lessons(more on
those later). And like the
original, this one didn't give
me much trouble, even though
it's still pretty fast.

keep in mind my tips from the

Here's also a bit more of info

(And the mice too!) Ignore them.
Fine, fine, stare at them for a

Rockers 2.......................
--------------------------------

In-game message: "The guitar
work gets a bit technical here,
but if you can pull it off, just
think how cool you'll look!"


Personal description: Well, it's
not longer, but this harder
version also sports with having
more in the same amount of time.
There is also a new command
needed here. Strange thing,
however, is that it requires the
use of the shoulder button.
Weird, eh? The only game to use
an actual button is the harder
version of Rockers. Well, in any
case, the shoulder button will
be used to, as the guys puts it,
make a "BWANNN!" kind of sound.
How about I say it's like using
the wammy bar on a real guitar.


Personal thoughts: One of my
favourite games. And as such, I
think it's fairly easy, but the
use of shoulder button is a bit
weird sometimes, so... I dunno.
But it's still one of my
favourites.


Tips for Superb: So, this one, I
think it's a bit picky with the
shoulder button parts. I dunno.
Sometimes when I get the full
comments that would signify I
would have gotten a superb, I
get a just OK. So... maybe it's
just me.

However, there are bits and

but it's very minor, you'd

slowing down some of the faster

Well, really, since this is

say that could be hard to do is
the Love Lizards part. Although,
yes, it only has one set of

not register since you might be

Medal Corner....................
--------------------------------

And so, with your precious
medals you've earned for getting
Superb ranks on the games you've
played, it will open games or
toys for you amusement. People
may simply think it's a waste of
space while others will gain
endless enjoyment out of them.
What will think? Well, find out
for yourself!

--------------------------------
Endless Games...................
--------------------------------

First, there's the endless
games. These games are,
obviously, endless and will,
once again obviously, never end
until you lose. You have a few
chances to make mistakes here
and there, though each game
varies on how many times you can
screw up. So, ready to go on an
"endless" journey? Aha ha ha...
Sorry.

Also, the point of me giving my
personal score is just... me
giving out my personal score. If
you wanna e-mail me to show me
off or something, that's cool.
I'll put your better score with
mine. If it's lower, then that's
fine too.

--------------------------------
Coin Toss.......................
--------------------------------

Coin Toss is the first Endless
game you unlock, being opened
for you when you get 2 medals.
The basis behind this one is
that you toss a coin into the
air by flicking. This will cause
a timer to show up. When it
reaches 3 seconds, tap to
recatch the coin. After the
first toss and your first catch,
the next toss, the timer will
disappear, but instead will be
replaced with some drum samples.
When you toss it for a third
time, some of the drum sample
near the end disappears, in an
attempt to screw with your
timing. Again, on your fourth
toss, some more of the drum
sample will be gone. On the
fifth toss, and entire 2 beats
of the ending will not have drum
samples, making it have you rely
on your own timing for this one.

Easy, easy, I know. Now here's
where it get constantly harder.
On every toss after the interval
of the fifth toss, the beats
will become slower and slower
each time, making the timing
more precise, thus seeing if you
have a good rhythmical sense, no
matter the kind of beat. It will
also restart the cycle back to
the timer to get you into the
how slow it will be. eg. (at the
6th toss, the timer will come
back and will be slightly
slower. on the 7th toss, the
drum samples will come back.
etc.)

Tips?: Well, don't ever tap
early just for kicks. If you do,
then your "hand" won't open back
up, thus making the coin fall.

My personal high is 26.

--------------------------------
Shoot-'Em-Up....................
--------------------------------

Shoot-'Em-Up, while being a
normal game, worked so fine,
they made it into an endless
game aswell, being unlocked for
your playing pleasure when you
get 7 medals. This plays exactly
like the normal version, so if
you like that, you'll love the
endless version. The endless
version starts out with you
going through all the cycles of
the original and the second one.
Once you get past the final set
of the second version, it will
go into a random state and throw
any of the patterns at you, even
the same one multiple times in a
row. You'll notice there is a
score up top and a bar to the
right. Well, score is obviously
to prove how awesome you are at
the game. The bar is a health
bar. Endless Shoot-'Em-Up has a
health bar the gradually
regenerates over time if you
miss some of the aliens. Also,
when your score gets to various
points, the radio girl will
appear and say a quick message.
Sometimes it's really hard to
read as it will appear, then
quickly disappear since a new
volly is coming your way and
reading and playing a rhythm
game are two seperate things and
is hard to do.

The part where it gets hardrer
then the normal versions is that
when it starts going random on
you, there's new aliens you have
to deal with. This things look
NOTHING like the ones in the
main game. Their main purpose it
to be more harder to hit then
the normal ones. This can prove
to be annoying when you're only
slightly and they manage to get
through while it would have hit
if it were the normal ones.
Another hard thing about this is
that when the background gets to
the yellow planet, the music on
your end starts to fade away.
This means that you'll have to
rely on your own rhythmical
sense to shoot those aliens, and
it better be pretty spot on too.
When it reaches the blue planet,
the music for your side will
disappear all together.

Shooting and making them explode
will make the points go up like
so: 100 *HIT* 200 *HIT* 500
*HIT* 1000 *HIT* 1000 *HIT* 1000
*HIT* etc.

Shooting and them swerving off
screen makes it so you'll get
the next set of points, but it
will revert back to 100, like
so: 100 *HIT* 200 *HIT* 500
*swerve* 100 *HIT* 200 *HIT*
etc.

Also, completing a full volly
gives you "PERFECT! 1000". Which
obviously means you just got
1000 extra points for not
getting hit. Remember, getting a
perfect in the original means
not getting hit. So, as long as
you don't get hit, you'll get
this bonus.

Though I haven't been able to
copy down all the Blastrounaut
says, she makes comments at
these points: "10,000 points!
Great shooting!"

"30,000 points! But the enemy
keeps coming! Don't expect them
to let up!"

"50,000 points! You seem to get
the swing of it!" (?)

"100,000 points! If I know you,
you're probably feeling like
you've made a breakthrough!"

"150,000 points! Don't forget to
take a break every oce in a
while! Ha! Just kidding!"

"200,000 points! Unbelievable! I
hate to ask... but...are you
sure you're human?"

"300,000 points! You've got real
rhythm! You should find some way
to use it in real life!"

"400,000 points! Are you kidding
me? How... how far do you plan
on going with this?"

"500,000 points! Are you OK? You
sure you don't need to rest your
eyes?"

"1,000,000 points! ..." (need)

More to be possibly
discovered...

Tips?: Need I remind you of the
tapping off the screen while
they come on screen? Really,
this is what saved my butt a lot
of times.

Also, for the trickier 8 vollys,
just tap you foot while you do
it. Every beat you tap, then tap
immediately after it to get the
second one that comes by. This
tip should probably be used when
you lose your side of the music.

Stay extremely concentrated and
don't feel cocky when you reach
X00,000 points or more. It will
feel nice to get that high, yes,
but during those times when you
just feel so accomplished,
that's when you're likely to
screw up. Don't think so highly
of youself when you get there.
Force you mind to get the next
comment point up!

My personal high is 1015900.

--------------------------------
Tunnel..........................
--------------------------------

So, Tunnel is the third Endless
game, getting it when you have
12 medals. This endless game is
a bit weird in that some lady,
maybe the character's mother?,
is driving a car and you're in
it. This one has a practice
thing to it before you get to
the real thing. All you have to
do it tap the screen to the
beat. This make the character
hit a cowbell with a stick. You
must do this non-stop.

This may sound easy, but it gets
pretty tedious since there's
little to no changes in this
one. Sure, the scenery changes
over time and some of them
really looks nice, but... I just
can't stand how plain it is. The
actual part of why it gets
harder is that you go through
tunnels. Now, while you're in a
tunnel, the music either gets
muffled slightly, or a lot, or
it just disappears until you get
out of the tunnel. This is where
you need your rhythmical senses
to kick in and help you keep the
beat. You can tell you're
starting to stray off beat when
the lady makes a really weird
looking face... Well, I kinda
prefer it if I kept the beat and
make her look normal, so... I
think you would too. If you're
too far off, she'll stop the car
and look at you, making one of
those scribbly emotions you
sometimes see in anime.

And... wait... what's this?
What's up with that sign that
says "555-PECK-YES"? Whatever.

Tips?: Tap you foot if you need
to keep the rhythm. Maybe even
hum the song once you get to
know it better as you'll know
how fast the tempo is.

My personal high is 2926.1.

--------------------------------
Samurai Slice...................
--------------------------------

Samurai Slice is a cool Endless
game when you get 17 medals.
Tapping will cause the samurai
to tap hit foot, which is
conveniently placed on top of a
wooden board. That being said,
various things will be thrown in
the samurai's direction, in
which he must tap to hit said
things up and towards him at a
high angle then slice it with a
swift flick. You'll get a
tutorial of how to cut the
certain things and just using
the wooden board to hit things
your way. When you cut
something, it will give out a
coin or two. At night, when the
moon is high, it'll earn 10
times what you normally would.

Where this gets hard is with
multiple patterns and increasing
speed. This has quite a few
patterns and most will be used
often while a few select will be
used rarely. Along with speed,
this can be a deadly combo since
you wouldn't be expecting on of
the rare ones, wasting one of
your chances. Speaking of
chances, you start out with 3
chances, represented by flames.
A Certain thing will give you a
extra chance if you manage to
cut, otherwise, it's like you
just wasted 2 tried with a
single mistake. You can have a
max of 5 chances. I'm unsure of
this however.

There are a totaly of 4 things
you can cut, which are:
Watermelon 1 coin Fish 2 coins
Shadow(unoffcial name) 2 coins
Golden Fish 2 coins, an extra
life.

And so night comes and... what
the? Another number thing?
"555-SAMURAI"? What's with these
things?

Tips: Well, it's seems hard to
me at first since it's so slow.
Just keep in rhythm somehow and
it'll speed up before you know
it.

This one needs your full
attention since it doesn't give
distinct audio cues for each
thing that comes on. And

My personal high is 1117.

--------------------------------
Glass Tappers...................
--------------------------------

The soothing sounds of glass
tapping to a relaxing tune will
open to you when you get 22
medals. This one is very
soothing and it all starts out
with you and your friends trying
to cheer up a sad woman. Having
a glass at hand really does come
in handy! Er, *ahem*, anyway.
There are three different things
you can do with the glass. Tap
it to have the glass echo it's
high-pitched sound. Tap and hold
to silence it, but make a brief
tapping noise. And flick, which
will make a louder tapping noise
for obviously reasons. You're
the last guy, obviously, and you
have 3 examples in front of you
so you can get the pattern your
friends do.

The part where Glass Tappers
gets hard is when you get into
speed and the different
patterns. The thing with the
patterns is that some are very
much like others, only varying
in one small difference that
might be hard to realize before
it's too late. The thing with
speed is that every 6 times you
successfully do a pattern before
the woman leaves, the faster it
gets. Also, at the same time,
every 6 involves a few kind of
female coming over and enjoying
your performance. There are 3
different reactions you can get
out of the females. The best is
that they're amused by the glass
tapping. Each one has their own
unique way of showing this. The
average is them just watching...
which is kind creepy looking...
The barely-made-it for this is
the girls aren't even watching
anymore. If you get the last
one, you better shape up and get
the next one right. If you make
a big mistake, they leave,
ending the game.

Also, I think there are only 4
different kinds of girls that
show up. Once you get the 4th
kind of girl there, it'll stay
on her. I'm not sure though.

Tips?: You have to learn how to
quickly understand the pattern
before it gets to you, unless
you want it to end right then
and there.

Also, see how the guys nod their
head? You can use that for
timing, but being myself, using
the nodding actually makes it
harder. Doesn't mean you
shouldn't try though!

Also, you can try tapping the
pattern off-screen to get a
better feel for it. I'm sure it
will help later in the faster
segments.

My personal high is 42.

--------------------------------
Rhythmove Dungeon...............
................................
........(ENDL6)
--------------------------------

Rhythmove Dungeon will open the
castle doors to you when you get
27 medals. This endless game
requires you to know the normal
beats and backbeats like the
back of your hand. The normal
beats move you up and right
while backbeats move you down
and left. It will go, in order,
up, down, right, left. You must
move from a starting point to
the ending point, the ending
point being a red gate thing.
There is only a single pathway,
so trying to go through a wall
sounds impossible to me. Along
the way, you'll find hearts
which add more lives to your
original set of 3. I think 4 is
the limit of lives you can get.
Maybe it's 5 and I just don't
know it.

Where this get's hard is that if
you don't know when to tap,
you'll squish against the wall.
After you move two places away
from the original starting
point, a monster thing will
appear from the starting point
and slowly make its way to you.
If you don't make it to the gate
in time, it'll get to you and
"kill" you, taking away one of
your lives. Combine both of
these together and you lose
fast. What's even more is that
later on, the beat will change,
making timing harder. Even more
so when it starts to get faster
and faster.

Tips?: I have no tips since I
can't do this one myself...

"If you wait a bit at the
beginning of each level when it
says "tap to start" or something
like that, you can see a blue
dot moving along the course in
time to the beat in the
background. It should help you
figure out the way you're
supposed to go." ~ from Anna-Mei

My personal high is nothing. I
haven't played and went through
with dying.

--------------------------------
Rhythm Toys.....................
--------------------------------

So, what exactly are Rhythm
Toys? Well, they're exactly as
they sound. They're simple toys
that you can screw around with
for a few minutes... or if you
have a short attention span,
hours.

--------------------------------
Business Card...................
--------------------------------

Well, the Business Card toy
isn't really much and it's
unlocked when you get your first
medal. Instead of the normal
coloured screen for the touch
screen area, it's a business
card. All yolu do is spin it
around by making a circle motion
on the touch screen. If you keep
doing it, you'll end up making
drumming sounds. The guy on the
top screen looks like he's
having fun, doesn't he?

Upon careful inspection, that
didn't take much time ot find,
there's also another number!
"555-EAT-BEET". I have a feeling
that these things are important
somehow...

--------------------------------
Phone...........................
--------------------------------

So the phone is also another
simple toy for your use when you
get 4 medals. Again, the touch
screen isn't the norm like in
the main games. It's got numbers
and a call and off button to it.
The 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9
buttons all make notes, but
since I"m no musical person, I
don't know if which one is "Mi"
or that one's "Sol" and whatnot.

And... wait a sec... Phone...
numbers... !!! How about you put
those numbers I listed about in
and see what comes up! All the
numbers start out with "555," so
I'll just leave those out.

PECK-YES (7325-937)
SAMURAI  (7268724)
EAT-BEET (328-2338)
ROCK-OUT (7625-688)

Eh? Where'd that last one come
from? Oh well, I'm sure you'll
find it on your own.

Also, for any of those other
musical people, you can recreate
some songs that are simple
enough only use 8 kinds of
notes. I managed to recreate the
Twonson theme from EarthBound.
If anyone wants to see how, or
if you've discovered a different
song you can recreate, then
please, tell me!

--------------------------------
Slot Monster....................
--------------------------------

Open to you after you aquire
your 8th medal awaits the Slot
Monster for you play... well,
slots. Again, not the normal
touch screen interface. Nothing
much to do other then pull the
handle down to start the
roulette. Music will play, and
the 3 buttons at the bottom of
the touch screen will light up a
a specific moment. Hitting these
buttons to the proper pattern
will make coins come out of the
monster's mouth, making the
moutain of coins go up higher
and higher until you reach the
top. Then it just stops.

--------------------------------
Octopus Machine.................
................................
........(TOYS4)
--------------------------------

Getting this one at 11 medals,
Octopus Machine proves to be the
hardest Rhythm Toy out of all of
them. Why? Well, first of all,
you have to copy what the other
2 octopus' do. It starts off
nice and slow you can get the
hang of it, but at some point it
will be ridiculously fast that
you won't be able to do a
certain pattern because the game
can't input it that fast. I
think it was the ... 6th cycle?
Maybe 7th. I can't remember and
I most certainly won't try and
do that again. Have fun with it
though.

--------------------------------
Beat Machine....................
--------------------------------

Who knew that tapping a small
thing would be easy, and at 14
medals too. So, this one, and
also the Octopus Machine, have
the normal touch screen
interface. So, pretty much, you
just tap. Yeah, that's it.
However, if you tap to a certain
tempo, then soon a bassist and a
guitarist will join you. You
have to keep the tempo up. You
can, of course, speed the tempo
up by twice as much, even four
times the normal tempo they're
going, so long as you keep it
steady. Failure to do so will
cause you to lose the other two
guys.

--------------------------------
Beat Bag........................
--------------------------------

Need a stress relief? Well, the
closing thing you'll get is the
Beat Bag once you get 19 medals.
It's pretty much you tap the
screen and it'll play a drum
riff. It's either multiple snare
drum hits, a different multiple
snare drum hits, and a cymbal.
If you really want to, you can
tap to the rhythm of other songs
that are playing, though it has
to be from a different source
since it can't play songs while
in Beat Bag. Kinda sucks... oh
well!

--------------------------------
Kappa DJ........................
--------------------------------

Woah, a DJ, that's a Kappa, and
only for 24 medals! Wait... if
it has a scratch table ontop of
it's head... where's the water?
HOW IS IT LIVING?! *smacked*
Well, in any case, the Kappa DJ
Rhythm Toy is... kinda boring.
It takes various sounds from the
game "DJ School" and you can
screw around with them if you
like. Yeah, that's... that's
about it...

--------------------------------
Guitar Lessons *Basic Course*...
................................
........(GITR1)
--------------------------------

So, after you beat "Rockers" in
the main game, this will open up
in the Medal Corner. What
exactly is this? Well, cut to
the chase, you play the Rockers
game to 4 different songs,
individually of course. The song
that you to are:

Crop Stomp Song (15 medals
required) Glee Club Song (20
medals required) Built to Scale
song (25 medals required) Freeze
Frame Song (30 medals required)

They don't need the usage of the
shoulder button as you've only
unlocked this set by playing the
first version of Rockers, so
technically, it hasn't been
introduced to the game yet.

The play through rates you from,
my guess is, 0 to 100. Between
96 to 100 will score you a
beautiful S rank. I'm not sure
about the other ranks, so if
someone could inform me the
other requirements for other
ranks via e-mail, much would be
apprecitated.

--------------------------------
Guitar Lessons *Technical Course
*...............................
........(GITR2)
--------------------------------

... I'm wondering if I should
just merge this and the Basic
Course together... In any case,
this is unlocked once you beat
"Rockers 2." Again, this is you
playing to the tunes of 4 other
games. All the songs are the
second version of them, so
they're longer and more full of
awesomeness. The songs are:

Munchy Monk Song (35 medals
required) Space Soccer Song (40
medals required) Splashdown Song
(45 medals required) Frog Hop
Song (50 medals required)

THESE ones need the use of the
shoulder button... but trust me,
these turn out more epic because
of said usage... granted, if you
can do it properly.

--------------------------------

Cafe............................
--------------------------------

So, need to skip a game or just
need (simple) help? Or how about
listening to some music? What
about reading something? Or...
practice you flicking if you
haven't already gotten a good
grip on it.

--------------------------------
Talk to the Barista.............
................................
........(TLKWB)
--------------------------------

So, the Barista. This man is the
guy who will either give you
simple tips, from my knowledge,
or will allow you to pass a game
that you just can't seem to get
a grip on.

Now, what I thought how this
free pass system worked was you
could pass any game you wanted,
bar remixes. It seems I was
wrong. Oh so very wrong indeed.
A guy by the name of Chandler
Gaillard told me that you can
indeed skip over remixes, since
apparently, that's what he had
been doing. New to me, I'm
currently checking each game to
see if you can skip them or if
there is a limit to how many you
can skip before you have to
actually beat one.

Limit?:
None. There is no limit

Which game(s) can't you skip?:
Built to Scale Reason?: Well,
it's the first game of Rhythm
Heaven. If you can't at least
grab the basics of this game
then... you're going to have
some kind of trouble later.

Remix 6 Reason?: Well, I would
firgure this is because this
remix is right before the
credits and whatnot, and you
should actually try and put all
your effort into seeing the
credits without the help of the
Barista.

Remix 10 Reason?: Remix 10 is
the final main game you play
before a normal minded person
goes for all Superb ranks and
Perfect ranks. The game now
tests you with all the games
bunched up into one. Plus, it
unlocks Battle of the Bands, so
that could also be a reason why
you have to beat it yourself.

So there you have it. You can
skip all but 3 games. That's
right. So, any review saying
"It's so unforgiving since it
won't let you pass some of
them," is complete BS, since
it's only 3 games. 3 GAMES! All
of which have a reasonable...
well, reason behind to their un-
skippableness(that's not even a
real word...).

Not every Perfect gets you music

games give you certain songs. To
get all of them, you have to get
a Perfect for each and every
game. Tedious, yes, I know, ut
just keep going at it to get all
the songs!

--------------------------------
Read Something..................
................................
........(READS)
--------------------------------

So, here is where you can read
something you've unlocked via
Perfects. These are either
diaries, letters, posters(text
only), anything you can read.
There are also lyric sheets and
character sheets, telling you
who some of the characters are
in some more detail.

I should also note that the
first two are the ones you start
out with. I will also type up
what each one says.

List:
1. "Greetings!"

Thank you for buying Rhythm
Heaven! It might take some
doing, but we hope you enjoy
each of the rhythm games we've
made for you!

Oh, if you're reading this, that
means you've played the game!
Never mind us, then! Keep
playing, and have a great time!


2. "The Secret of Flicking"

Are you getting the hang of
flicking the stylus? It takes a
little oomph, doesn't it? If
you're still having touble, let
me show you a little secret.

You know how when you write a
checkmark, you end with that
tail that goes up sharply? Try
making your flick just like
you're writing the tail of a
checkmark. Just get ready for a
burst of energy, and flick like
you really mean it. The real
trick is learning how to snap
your wrist properly.

Keep practicing that flick until
it's as natural to you as
snapping your fingers.

(personal note- What if people
can't snap their fingers? XD)


3. "Rally Certificate"

Award

You have performed outstandingly
at the Rhythm Rally Table Tennis
Tourney, so we would like to
persent you with this
certificate of achivement.

What? You want to know if you
won? Oh, we don't know. See,
winning and losing don't matter
when you're having such a
delightfully rhythmical rally.
And here's your certificate!

Space Gramps,
Chairman of the Rhythm League

(personal note- Take what they
said about winning or losing and
apply it to everything else in
video games... except about the
rhythm part, but you get the
idea)


4. "Help Wanted"

Our farm needs workers to help
us bring in the harvest and rid
of our mole problem.

We don't discriminate by gender.
(But you must have rhythm.)

We don't discriminate by age.
(But you must be able to catch.)

You can take off any days you
want. (Just give us some
notice.)

We'll pay whatever you want.
(Just don't ask for too much.)

Come join in the harvest fun! We
can't wait to hear from you!

5. "Concert Poster"

Tiny Ghosts Live!

The Tiny Ghosts cae confirmed
for a live show here in town!
They don't have much time, but
they've promised to play all
eight of their songs! Don't miss
this rare opportunity!

Time: A late night sometime
soon! Place On a tabletop
somewhere!

Tickets are $35 beforehand, or
$35 day of show!

Everyone! Come on out!


6. "What's a Guiro?"

The guiro lizard and his guiro
cutie live in the desert. The
male is smaller than the female,
but his tail is huge. He can
shake it to make it sound like a
maraca.

The female's tail is very hard,
and she can use it to rub the
ridges on her back to make a
rattling sound. You can often
see her performing this mating
call around Carnival. When
mating calls of the male and
female overlap perfectly, the
two form a beautiful rhythmic
bond.

When it's festival time, this
good-natured reptile likes to
heat up its cold blood with loud
music and crazy dansing.


7. "Robot Manual"

Fueling Robots

These robots are delicate,
precise machines. They also have
very advanced artificial
intelligence. By the time they
reach the fueling zone at the
end of the assembly, the robots
are already consious and aware
of other robots around them.

These sensitive robots might be
offended if they notice another
robot reciving more fuel than
they do. They're sort of
delicate that way. Also, they
tend to explode when given too
much fuel. They are sort of
delicate that way, too.

However, if you give them just
the right amount of fuel,
they'll take off into the skiesm
the happiest robots you've ever
seen. I don't know why they do
this. They must be very advanced
indeed!

(personal note- What? So you
guys make the robots yet don't
know why they fly into the air
the way they do? Seriously, come
on.)


8. "DJ School Flier"

Now Recruiting Wannabe DJs!

Out DJ school is looking for
people who want to look like a
real DJ! Our friendly,
courteous, and strangely yellow
instructor will show you the
moves!

Learn how to fake breathtaking
breaks, and pretend to pull off
supertight pitch shifting! If
you want to look like you're a
DJ, enroll today!

Notice

People interested in becoming
real DJs need not apply. our
facilities can handle only
people who want to LOOK like DJs

(personal note- ... Really?)


9. "Blue Bird Diary"

Bule Bird Diary

Please read this, It makes all
the scenes during the game make
sense...

April 16 It's finally happened!
All my dreams have come true!
I've joined the Blue Bird
Brigade! First up: bazic
training! We need to get in
shape fast. Our captain is small
but ever so demaning. Wish me
luck!

April 20 They call it basic
training, but there's nothing
basic about it! We had to tug a
tank while the cpatin tode on
it, yelling at us the whole way!
Boy. It was sure heavy.

May 2 Still more basic training.
Pedal-powered airplanes are a
bad idea. Why can't we fly using
our own wings?

May 10 Parachute training today.
I have wings! Why do I need a
parachute? Why won't the captain
let me fly with my own two
wings?

May 14 We were just sort of
wandering arounf today because
we were so tired. All of a
sudden, we fell off a cliff! (It
was an an accident!) I think
we's all forgotten that we even
had wings, because we climbed
our way back up. Still, the
sunset made it all worthwhile.

May 24 Tomorrow, we will finally
learn where we're being assigned
to. Who knows where we'll be
posted?Our leader keeps saying
"somewhere fun," but coming from
him, that just scares me more.
Ahh, it's too scary! Eep.


10. "Crew's Log"

I command the battleship tasked
with protecting our home planet
from the scourge of alien
invaders. It is my duty. It is
my life.

We fight an enemy fueled not
only by aggression but also by
unstoppable rhythm! Keeping the
beat in such tense conditions
change you, make you forget who
you are. And losing sight of who
you are is a frightening thing.

But when I heara certain voice,
I remember who I am again. I
remember why I do this. My dear
friend on the com-link gives me
instrustions, but she also gives
me encouragement when the battl
is heated. I may be far from
home, but she sounds like she's
sitting right beside me.

My duty is my life. I will fight
and fight until I can go home.
But when I do, I'll see her
again.

(personal notes- Woah, guy in
the ship you were controlling
has a crush on the blastronaut
girl? Crazy stuff.)

12. "Eyewitness Accounts"

We've just scored some juicy
info on the hot new mystery
monster! Dumpling Man!

Listen to these eyewitness
reports! Bear: "OK, so, yeah. I
was all hungry for dinner
right?"

"And I saw this guy, and I was
all, 'yeah, he'll do!' I started
to sneak up on him when he went
and showed down on, like, a
dozen dumplings at once. It
kinda made me sick to watch, so
I just kinda left him alone, you
know?"

Carny Barker: "Come one, come
all, and listen to my tale of
wonder! For this 'Dumpling Man,'
as you call him, once worked
within these very tents as a
clown! 'Til I canned the rat for
eating on the job, anyway."

Circus Ringmaster: "I couldn't
believe my luck! A former clown,
just wondering the hills looking
for dumplings! He said he was
training, but I didn't ask what
for."

"The way he ate them was
magical. I hired him at once for
my circus, but the life on the
glittering stage held no appeal
for him. He vanished soon
after."

More news as it happens!


13. "A Confession"

My boyfriend's funny. It's like
he was born with a camera glued
to his nose or something.

So when he got into face cars, I
said, "Why don't you take some
pictures for the local paper,
hun?"

No surprise here... but how?
He's obsessed wuth work! He
dspends all his time at the
racetrack! I thought I had a
career in modeling. He never
even points that camera at me
anymore. I'm just a little
lonely.

Anyway, I decided to pull a
little prank on him. I went into
the racetrack where he works. I
dressed up as one of the pit
crew. I was covered in grease!
It was disgusting, but that's
beside the point...

So there he was, snapping
pictures of his precious race
cars, when I leapt in front of
the camera! And at that exact
moment? I heard the shutter
snap! He actually took a picture
of me!

I can't wait to see the look on
his face when he develops that
photo! I wish I looked a little
more presentable, but
whatchagonnado?


14. "Sync or Swim Weekly"

Special Edition

Synchonized swimmers has a new
set of stars!

At last week's tournament, a
band of fresh-faced swimmers
demonstrated an impressive
performance... with animals!

As if it weren't challenging
enough to coordinate an all
human team, they've chosen to
include a band of highly trained
sea mammals in their
performance, and let me tell
you, they blew our flippers off!

These masters of the aquatic
form must have spent a great
deal of time training their
friends from the briny blue, and
it shows!

Wee expect great things from
them!


15. "Life of a Dog Ninja

Few dogd choose the way of the
ninja, But those who do, we do
so because we must.

Sadly, there's not much call for
ninja work these days, so I've
taken a part- time job cutting
veggies. It's good work, I
guess.

Vegetables, cast-iron skillets,
tires (whitewall or
standard!)... I'll cut anything!
I need the money to buy
shuriken.

(personal note- Poor guy. Still
cool that he's a ninnja though.)


16. "Lab Journal"

October 1

I'm so glad I landed this job at
the lab! I had no idea when I
graduated that I'd be working on
such important stuff!

October 2

My first day was totally
uneventful, except for the
bright and shining spot: my
senior lab partner! And he's
totally my type. I can't believe
it! This palce is great!

October 3

I was so busy swooning at my
senior lab partner that I didn't
even notice that guy (or...
girl?) next to me. He (or...
she?) was wearing this weird
costume. It wasn't creepy. It
was just... weird.

October 7

The weird guy in the costume
(turns out it WAS a guy!) asked
me if I could help him with an
experiment tomorrow. I can't
really say no, but I'm a little
worried. I think the costume
freaks me out a bit.

October 8

You'll never guess what
happened! I went down to a
special lab with the weird
costume guy, and there he was!
My senior lab partner! I still
don't know we're working on, but
with him there, I know it will
be all right!

I'll be busy with this
experiment for a little while,
so this might be my last journal
entry for a bit.

P.S. At least I get to spend all
day talking to my dreamy senior
lab partner! La lala lala!

(personaly notes- Well, what'd
you expect? I kinda figured that
she liked him before I even got
this, via subtle hints in-game.)


17. "Guitar Monthly"

This month's special edition:

Don't call it a comeback!

Remember J.J. Rocker, the man
once known as "the King of
Headbanging"? Well, he's teamed
up with a student of his to
create a rocking duo!

Rocker's furious headbanging has
already made him a rock legend,
but it also resulted in an
injury that took him out of the
touring circuit for years. Now,
he's back, and with his student
at his side, we'll see if
Rocker's still knows how to
throw the rock down!

(personal notes- ... Woah. An
injury from headbanging? Sweet
jeez, how hard was this guy
flinging his head around? I
guess that explains the weird
strumming movement that both him
and yourself do.)


18. "Catch You on the Flip Side"

Since it pops up quite a bit in
this game, we should tell you
about the "flip side" of the
music world.

Wehn you listen to a song, you
might find youself following the
beat by tapping your fingers.
Picture it now. "Tap, tap, tap,
tap."

Let's say your start paying
attention to the part of the
beat where you lift your finger.

If you finger is tapping out of
the main rhythm, then when you
lift your finger, that's when
you're hitting the flip side of
the rhythm. That's offbeat.

Some people train themselves to
follow a beat by always tapping
to the offbeat. It can be hard
to learn, but it has its
rewards.

They rhythm game Lockstep gives
you that same kind of training.
Once you master the switch to
the offbeat, you'll find your
whole sense of whythm has
improved.

Give it a shot.


19. "An Essay on Keepy-Upsy"

I am... a space kicker. My job,
strange though it may seem, is
to keep my ball aloft as I float
in space.

When they first launched me into
space, I thought it was weird.
I've gotten use to the idea
now...

My teammates are great too. It
makes me proud to have been born
a space kicker...

Thanks, Mom!

(personal notes- So, wait...
that's a job they have? Keeping
a soccer ball up?)


20. "Cheering Tips"

Lesson 1

To play the DON DON DON DON
part, you must be stong of
heart! Every beat requires your
full commitment!

Lesson 2

To play the DON DOKO DOKO DON
part, you must be light and
free! Keep control. and put a
sharp snap to tge sticks.

Lesson 3

The DOKO DOKO DON part is a trap
laid for anyone whose heart
isn't commited to taiko. You
must maintain focus to the very
end if you have any hopes of
victory.


21. "Leader's Notes"

I use to be in a group called
the Clappy Trio. We would clap
along with the popular music of
the day, mostly on street
corners, mostly for spare
change. But all that changed on
day...

I saw another group nearby, a
chorus group that just couldn't
get their act together. Oh, the
first two were great, but their
third member was so nervous that
he couldn't stop singing out of
turn. And what I felt when I
heard them... I just can't
describe.

I decided to leave the Clappy
Trio abd take this chorus under
my wing. They called me
conductor, but I'm just here to
help them along. They're the
stars, and I try to stay out of
their way.

I hope that when you see them,
you'll think how far they've
come, and you'll cheer these
brave, talented singers on for
me!

(personal notes- Now nice :3 If
you don't know who the Clappy
Trio is, they're originally from
the first game, "Rhythm
Tengoku.")


22. "Moai Language Lesson"

<oai Language Lesson

The language that we have dubbed
"Moai Song" has the following
characteristics:

Moai repeat a phrase verbatim to
signal agreement.

Even a slight shirtf in he
phrase expresses disagreement
with the original singer.

This has resulted in the messy
ending of many a moai
friendship.

In order to maintain good
relationships, moai strive to
listen closely to what their
partners say.

They may look relaxed, but they
are actually intently focused on
listening closely before
replying.

We could all learn a great deal
from how much attention they pay
to what their friends have to
say.

(personal notes- Aha ha ha, I
couldn't have worded that last
part any better myself.)


23. "Character Profiles 1"

Robot Models

ROBO M: This is the standard
model, and the bast selling to
boot.

ROBO L: This luxury model
consumes a tremendous amout of
fuel.

ROBO S: This tiny robot (also
known as "tinybot") beagn
manufacture at the second
factory. Small and cute, this
robot was designed for the
kiddies.

Paddler

These strange beings live on a
diet of table tennis. If they
stop playing, they grow weak abd
sickly. Some have successfully
weaned themselves off table
tennis by substituting paddle
ball.

Moai

Only two moai appear in this
game, and they are the only two
of their kind living on their
island. (However, there are
rumors of a tinfy bundle of moai
joy coming sometime in the near
future!)

(personal notes- ... No comment
on that last one there...)


24. "Character Profiles 2"

Clodhopper Pickens

This cheery fellow loves his
work. He hits the fields and
harvests vegetables every day,
and he's pretty handy at dealing
with moles. He truly is
multitalented. And he's single,
ladies!

Training Monk

This serious-minded lad seems to
think he's training himself to
talk the path of true
enlightment, but really he
really just seems to be training
for an eating contest.

DJ Yellow

His students love his enthusiasm
and his sense of humor, and his
special move is famous throught
the world. Scratch-o, hey!

Tiny Ghosts

A live band made up of ghosts.
It sounds confusing at first,
but they put on quite a show.
They do tend to rush through
their songs a bit, though.

Stepswitchers

These strange sould are obsessed
with seeing both sides of every
debate and hearing every side of
every beat. They're amazing at
keeping the tempo!

(personal notes- Nothing can
express what I'm feeling besides
this: Stepswitchers are perhaps
the best people in the world,
even if they're fictatious. Why?
Because they WANT to see both
sides of every debate. If only
every one where like this...)


25. "Supporting Cast 1"

Shoot-'Em-Up Radio Lady

This little lady has the crucial
job of sending out orders abd
rallying the spirits of our
proud psace defenders! She's
pretty dedicated to the job, so
she doesn't have much of a
social life.

Moai Bird

This bird belongs to the
perchanpoop family of finches,
which has a curious reaction to
music. Their sensitive ears
detect irrgularities in music
that result in other kinds of
irregularities in birds
themselves.

Racing Fans

You've seen them before, but you
had no idea they were such big
fans of car racing, did you? The
chorus conductor, hey, even the
table-tennis guys... Who knew?


26. "Supporting Cast 2"

Hidden Characters

Keep an eye peeled during The
Dazzles, you might just catch a
surprise appearance from a
special little guy.

Rally Girls

These lovely ladies really
brighten up the Taiko Rallies.
the drummer guys get really
worked up about their
performance when they see these
cuties doing their thing.

Mysterious Lab Tech

Down at the Love Lab, there's
one lab tech who always dresses
up in a costume. He (or she?)
may look shady, but there's no
need to worry. It's all on the
up- and-up.


27. "Lyrics Card 1"

)This song appears in Frog Hop.)

30. "Lyrics Card 4"

Stuck in the Rain

Music: TSUNKU
Arranged by Kaori Okubo

(This song appears in Karate
Man.)

Love has a cruel sense of fun.
It never plays by the rules.
It spins up both on our heads,
Turns up both in fools.

It leaves me on my own
With tearstained eyes,
Oh, what can I do?

They say that losing at love,
Breaking your heart.
It only makes you look
Even more beautiful.

I don't believe it's true,
But I see you and what can I do?

I wish that we could be close.
Close enough to use
Our Real names for once,

And you would say to me.
"Oh, I love you so!"
You'll say you won't let me.

Rain falls on me,
And now I'm walking away.
Tell me, do you find me
More beautiful now?

I'm not the kind to let
You watch as I cry,
So, I've got to leave...
I've got to foget you.

And so I'll hide
Myself away from the world,
Leave behind the sorrow
Of a sad little girl.

I thought that I had finally
Won at the game.
You told me it just was for fun.
I suppose that I was too young.


31. "Lyrics Card 5"

That's Paradise

Music TSUNKU
Arrangment by Yuichi Takahashi

(This is the ending theme song!)

It's paradise since the first
time I saw you standing there,
But it seems to long ago now,
yeah.

It's paradise, but no map can
Show us how to get there. Come
on, oh, baby, planet of love.

We made our way out of the long,
Long darkness, and we've
Made it this far.
Such a long road, so let's go!

Shining all the way,
Oh, we're on our own path now.
We can take it anywhere
That we want to go, ooh hoo!

Sweet song of love,
Og, can you hear it too?
I am always looking at you,
My sweet girl.

And I see you right there,
Smiling back at me too! Woo!

(personal notes- Any one else
notice how the beginning on each
of these lyric cards changed? Me
thinks several different people
had a go at translating each
lyrics card, thus it's
different. That's my guess
anyway.)


32. "The Rhythm League"

Congratulations on getting a
Perfect on Remix 10! So, how
many more Perfects do you need
to get, anyway?

It doesn't matter. We just
wanted to congratulate you and
maybe give you a little closure.

You've really stomped your way
through a lot of rhythm games!
I'm sure it was a long, hard
road, but you did it. Way to go!

As long as you've learned how
fun rhythm can be, we're happy!

Thanks for sticking it out to
the bitter end! We couldn't be
more proud of you! Thanks for
playing!

Extra...........................
--------------------------------

This is where I'll share subtle
things that maybe some people
have been able to spot but
others wouldn't have noticed.
Also will be cameo listings.
Here, I'll show what I'll have
down. Note, I'll only do games
that are currently up. A good
chunk will be cameo listing from
the previous game, Rhythm
Tengoku. Anything that will be
revealed via the "Read
Something" will not show up
here.

Remix 2: -In the "Shoot-'Em-Up"
parts, if 3 out of 4 small
rabbits from a remix only
version of "Marcher." These
rabbits are also found in the
Wario Ware games.

Crop Stomp: -The various "beets"
are actuall Rhythm Tengoku game
"Rhythm Epilation." You can even
get a good look at the Onion one
if you get all the "beets" in
the basket and look at the very
top of the mountain of
vegetables.

Freeze Frame: -This has the most
cameos in a s Apparition," the
white mouse from "Stealth Rat,"
the white penguin from "Show
Time," and the black and white
ninjas from "Ninja" in the
pictures. The crowd is made up
of the monkeys from "Tap Dance,"
the dancers from "Space Dance,"
the rappers from "Rap Men," and
the three clappers from
"Clapping Trio." Even though it
is mentioned in the "Read
Something" area, it doesn't
really say where these
characters are from.

-The racer may be looking at the

-"I realized that the Rainbow co
in Mario Kart 64." ~ irondomokun

The Dazzles: -Though mentioned
in the "Read S it is. After
making a ton of the bigger stars
with faces one them appear, one
will have a little guy hanging
from it. This is the guy from
"Night Walk," along with the
stars. If you have a hard time
spotting him, he's usually on
the star the disappears last or
close to last. He might even be
mostly off screen.

Love Lab:
-When failing to pass/grab a fla
into black skulls.

-Every once and a while, after p
more, the girl will shift her
eyes to the guy with glasses.
EDIT - Confirmed, the guy does
not shift his eyes to her.

Remix 5: -In the "Frog Hop"
parts, there screen with a happy
face, much like other audience
members when you do a successful
flick in Splashdown.

Karate Man:
-The character you play as, Kara
from "Karate House."

-When the vocalist goes "I wish
beginning of that line, more
specifically the word "I" and a
little bit before, Joe blushes
briefly.

The Dazzles 2:
-The same little guy from "Night
holding onto the sheep.

Fan Club 2: EDIT: -Correction!
Both the big screen sky,
however, the smaller sprite has
a really odd looking hand,
making it look like a peace
sign.

Remix 7: -Could be entirely a
coincidence picture looks a lot
like the the little girl in "The
* Bon Odori" from Rhythm
Tengoku.

Blue Birds 2: -While looking at
the "memoies", in-game cameos
one held by Karate Joe training
in the snow(so he was in Russia
all that time!) and another by
the Stomp Farmer looking off
into the distance.

Remix 9:
-All three rank pictures feature
astronaut.

-The alien(s) in tiny UFOs in th
appearance to the little alien
in Rhythm Tengoku, "Air Batter."
(so... the Night Walk guy
travelled too far into the Air
Batter territory?)

-The "rabbits" in the Superb ran
version of "Marcher." (huh, so I
guess the Night Walk guy landed
on the moon where the Marcher
rabbits reside...)*

Shoot-'Em-Up 2: -The radio guy
in this one is ac Tengoku. Even
in the Superb rank picture, he's
in the middle of a march!

Medal Corner menu: -A certain
part of the song soun in Rhythm
Heaven, though it could
definitely be just a
coincidence.

Samurai Slice Endless Game: -It
has the foot-tapping samurai
don't know what "Iai" means,
it's a kind of sword movement,
requiring the swordsman to take
out, slice and sheath his sword
in one movement. *random*

Guitar Lessons menu (both):
-The song is actually a revamped
Rhythm Tengoku

Read Something: -If you wiat
long enough, you'll they guy
will wake up, abruptly ending
his snoring. This is a reference
to the original Rhythm Tengoku,
as when you're checking through
the mail, there's a sprite of a
guy on the computer. If you
don't anything for a while,
he'll fall asleep.

Perfect runs: -The little P in
the upper left- Those eyes
happen to shift around when
you're not doing anything.

--------------------------------
Notice..........................
--------------------------------


Yeah yeah, I know I don't have
everything I have already listed
in the table of contents. If it
makes you feel better about me
completing this soon, I've
already 100% completed the game.
And don't worry about easter
eggs and the like, I'll get to
it, but first the main games.

Also feel free to e-mail me
about typos. I'm horibble with
typos since I manage to miss a
lot of them without even
noticing until it's a few weeks
later. Thanks :V

Also feel free to send me any
tips that I have not listed for
any of the games up at the
moment. Different people have
different techniques and I'd be
gald to see how other people
deal with each game.

NEW: So, seeing a couple of
posts on GameFAQs Rhythm Heaven
board has showed me the ranking
system isn't what I think it is.
In some cases, I'm making
mistakes where they really
count, causing the game to give
me an instant Just OK. If you
see anywhere that I've made this
kind of mistake, since I really
don't want to go though it right
now, please e-mail me and say
which one I've screwed up on.
Much would be appreciated.
