UNLOCKABLE DUNGEONS [UDL]

CREDITS [CD]
+-------------------------------
INTRO[IT]
+-------------------------------

+-------------------------------
STARTING OFF [SO]
+-------------------------------
Okay, here are some tricks of
the trade to keep you alive in
this game. First off, as you
move through dungeons, and are
able to do through, doing things
at your own pace, you'll be able
to go over and select missions,
go through dungeons, play mini
games etc. I highly recommend
revisiting the dungeons that you
can, and also the floors of
dungeons that you can't.

Be sure to also complete side
missions that you have available
before proceeding. The reason is
because you'll have to do some
leveling up in order to get
through some places in the main
gain. Sometimes, just playing
and partaking in combat will
yield the appropriate amount of
EXP, but once in a while there
is a difficulty spike, and you
team may not always be the most
well put together one, but is
the best you can do at the time.

You can toss items as enemies,
and so toss able items that
bestow effect that are generally
undesirable or hinder your
opponents' progress like sleep
or stunning them, is key. Keep
them in your inventory, and
generally save them for bosses
or when in a pinch.

Traps are sometimes a pain in
dungeons, but you can take steps
to either avoid them through
items, or use them against
enemies, also through items, so
keep that in mind whenever you
have excess inventory space.
Grind, grind, grind, leveling up
is very important, so going out
of your way revisiting fairly
moderate challenged sections
will yield great payoffs in the
long run.




+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 1: A STORM AT SEA [C1]
+-------------------------------

Alright, start off by answering
the questions, and you'll be
given a specific pokemon based
on your answers and personal
preferences. After that, select
your partner characters. When
you get control after landing on
dry land, head over to the cave
in the the beach.

You're going to have to defeat a
Zubat and his buddy Koffing.
Keep heading through, and the
enemies you'll run into are:
Corsola, Kabuto, Shellder and
Shellos. Zubat and his pal
should be on the B5 floor.Don't
bother picking up all of the
items, due to the lack of
inventory space you're given.
The one item you SHOULD hold
onto is the blast seed.

Use it against Zubat when you
reach him. When you reach
Koffing and Zubat, you shouldn't
have much trouble felling them
both if you use the blast seed.
The battle's much easier when
one of the two clunkers goes
down, and so you should be done
with them in short time. When
you're finished with them,
you'll be able to get the Relic
Fragment that belongs to your
partner.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 2:THE NEW GUIL RECRUITS
[C2]
+-------------------------------

After the cutscene, you'll be
entered into a guild, as the
chapter title hints at. You can
now teleport back to town when
you're taken out, a map, and you
can now hold 12 items in stock.
The map is self writing, meaning
it'll habitually fill itself out
when you get to new areas.

Along with the other items, one
you should note is the scarf
that Wigglytuff gives you. It
provides a decent lift to the
defense stat, so you'll want to
equip it immediately. Now that
you've got a steady job, finish
your first nine to five by
searching for Spoink's lost
pearl. You'll have to head into
Drenched Bluff to get it. It
should be on the B7 floor.

On the way through to your
destination, the enemies you'll
see are Anorith, Chingling,
Lileep and Shellos. I was about
level 8 when heading to the
destination, but being at level
7 is enough. The Chinglings are
the only Pokemon that can
actually give you a bit of a
task, so don't ignore them. When
you obtain the pearl, you'll
gain some goodies, and some
cash. Your employers tax you,
though.



+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 3:THE SCREAM [C3]
+-------------------------------

When the sun comes up signaling
a new day, head over to the
parot Pokemon Chatot, and after
that, you'll be in a new area.
Treasure Town is the place you
look around. Take your time
exploring if you want, but your
main objective is to look up the
Kecleon shop. Spend the money
you have on the things that you
think will benefit you the most,
and when done, you'll rendezvous
with Marill, Drowzee and co.
Head over to Bidoof next.

Whether you're in shape or not,
you'll have to race all the way
over to Mt. Bristle. I'd
recommend getting to level 10 if
you aren't already. On your way
through you'll fight such
enemies as Geodude-my personal
favorite Pokemon of all time,
Doduo, Machop, Nidorin@, Starly
and Spinarak. The difficulty of
the enemies is a little higher
that what you've just gone
through, but staying a couple
levels ahead of what you started
is always a good choice to avoid
getting overwhelmed.

Grind a little, fighiting the
weaker enemies for EXP, because
Drowzee can be pretty hard. He
also has possession of the move
confusion, so take the time to
level up now so you don't have
to fight him twice. When you
finally get to the bugger and
beat him, you'll gain some
goddies, including being able to
carry more treasures, and you'll
unlock the Bidoof's Wish episode
from the main menu. When you
head back to HQ, you'll be able
to tackle side missions, and a
Krabby near the area will tell
you about bonus missions found
in bottles that wash up in the
beach.

I'd recommend doing them for the
bonuses they entail, and also,
when ever available, complete
the rudimentary side quests that
you can do to gain the bonuses,
the goodies, and strengthen your
character. When you've actually
done a couple of the side
quests, you'll complete the
chapter.




+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 4:The Gatekeepers [C4]
+-------------------------------

When the mission starts and
you're briefed on what you have
to do, figure out which Pokemon
are going to be coming along be
observing their foot prints. It
should be fairly simple, and you
will be give hints the more time
you take. You get rewards from
Chatot from doing this.

When able to, check out the jobs
from the Outlaw Notice Board if
you please. You can tackle these
missions for their above average
rewards, but they are harder
than the other rudimentary
missions you've been given.
Ending the chapter will happen
once you've completed one of
these missions.

I highly recommend bringing a
lot of health restoring items
and revival items when ever you
decide to take on these
missions, because sometimes you
won't have a problem with them,
and other times, the outlaw have
a ton of guys waiting to take
you out, or waiting to ambush
you. Still, you should try doing
as many of them as you can as
well if you're somewhat able
because of the rewards you get.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 5:THE FIRST OFFICIAL
EXPLORATION [C5]
+-------------------------------

Chatot will give you a new
assignment that needs completing
that involves waterfalls and
mysteries. And you've been
placed in the solving part of
that equation. You will now be
able to recruit other Pokemon
you find in dungeons to fight on
your side.

Now, before heading over to the
waterfall to check it out,
you're going to want to finish
up some of the tasks you have
available. You'll need to level
up a bit if you don't want the
following sections to be
tiresome. I'd recommend getting
to at least level 13- level 14
(leaning towards 14). When
you're done and a little more
confident that before, and when
the other members of your party
are strong enough to kick some
tail, head over to the
waterfall, and like most hidden
caves in movies and games, it's
behind the waterfall.

Head through, and fight your way
through the hordes of Barboach,
Psyduck, Lotad, Poliwag, Grimer,
Tangela, Surskit, Wooper, and
Whiscash. Now here, you're going
to have a lot of trouble if you
have fire Pokemon, or at least
not enough type diversity on
your team. Don't hit the water
Pokemon with water moves, as
they'll most likely actually
like it. Let the other
characters fight on, while your
precious little fire Pokemon sit
back, for the most part.

A better strategy still, is to
just bring only the Pokemon
you'll need, and leave the fire
types at home. You can shop in
this dungeon, well at least it
happened the first times I
played. As the dungeons are
random, this may not be the same
in your play through, but you'll
want to bring some cash on you
just in case. Your goal is to
reach B9 floor, and though it
doesn't have a boss, the enemies
on the way there will give you a
problem if you don't take care.
See why I recommended leveling
up?



+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 6:TEAM SKULL [C6]
+-------------------------------

A couple of shops and
dinglebitters are now available
for you to shop, look at, or
ignore. Remember to keep taking
care of the missions available,
the Diglett bull crap (dude
should at least be paying you
more for something that he could
be doing) ad when you're about
one or two levels stronger, move
to your good ol' buddy, Chatot.
Chatot will want you to find a
perfect apple in the mission:
Find a perfect apple. What
you're going to have to do here
is find a perfect apple.

On your way to find the apple,
the Pokemon you'll come across
will be mostly grass and bug
types, like Butterfree, Budew,
Burmy, Beedrill, Hopip, Paras,
the cocoon equivalents to
Beedrill and Butterfree, Oddish,
Gloom, Combee and Exeggutor.
Though some of the enemies can
get you out of turn, for the
most part, these enemies are
manageable, though the dungeon
is pretty long.

Head through the dungeon
spelunking, and you'll be done
soon. It can get annoying
depending on how you luck out
due to the dungeon's randomness,
but it's not that bad. You'll
unlock some shops in town when
you're done. Again, finish up
some quests and tasks before
speaking to Chatot, who is
usually the cause of beginning
and end of chapters.



+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 7:THE GUILD'S BIG
EXPEDITION[C7]
+-------------------------------

Now here, you'll be able to take
a couple of side paths to tackle
either now or later, or not at
all, because they are all
optional at this point in time.
I'll run through them, and
recommend that you go through
them rather than skipping them
altogether. When taking the path
to the side, you should be at
about the right level, and will
run into Wingulls, Spheals, and
Gastrodons, and you'll be
accompanied with a Bidoof.

You can come here and fight a
bunch for EXP, as it's not the
hardest dungeon you've been to.
The Craggy Coast area is where
you'll want to be at least a
level higher, preferably level
16, and will face the same
enemies with the addition of
Dratini, Krabby, and Sealeo. You
won't have much help here,
Bidoof is your life line. If he
dies, you'll be taken out of the
dungeon, but he's fairly decent.
The Rocky/Rock path should be
taken on when you're a level or
two higher than if you took on
Craggy Coast.

The enemies there are few, Natu,
Bonsly, and Shroomish. Here, the
dungeon isn't too hard or long,
but again, you'll be with
Bidoof. Look around the floor to
the bottom level and you'll be
done with it. Mount Horn is
difficult. I highly recommend
leveling to 18 or even 19. Bunch
of bug Pokemon here: Shroomish,
Ariados, Parasect, Natu, Bonsly,
Pineco, Aerodactyl, Cascoon and
Beautifly, and Venomoth. There
are a lot of floors to go
through. There are a lot of
floors to go down through. I'm
sorry, I don't think I've made
myself quite clear, THERE ARE A
LOT OF FLOORS TO GO THROUGH.
Fourteen to be exact.


The enemies are also pretty
strong, so that doesn't make
things any easier. Watch for
Venomoth, as he hits hard, don't
bring anything you don't want to
lose, and keep a close eye out
for Aerodactlyl, who can use his
pressure to decrease the pp you
have available to use. The
chapter won't end until you get
past this dungeon, so like I
said, prepping by leveling up is
the best cause of action. The
dungeon takes a while, but
patience will get you through,
and also make sure to watch for
the heavy hitting, and annoying
Pokemon to avoid tossing away
your console prematurely.

+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 8:GROUDON'S HEART[C8]
+-------------------------------

Bidoof will go his own way after
you touch base at base. The path
to the side isn't the longest or
hardest dungeon you've been to,
so don't worry about it much.
Especially after the ordeal
you've just been through. Some
different Pokemon to face,
Pinsirs, Kriketots, Pinsir,
Swinub, Linoone, Sunsparce and
Houndour.

Stick around for a bit and level
up a it, is the doctor's orders
here, and when done, you'll see
your hard work pay off when the
next section gets harder. The
harder level goes by the name of
Foggy Forest. Again, it's not
difficult, so I'd highly
recommend leveling up a couple
of levels before moving on. Say
hello to the Cherubi, Hoothoot,
Zigzagoons and Smeargles.

There's a bunch of floors to go
through again, so it's best to
not do it all over again by not
being prepared. There are also
Pachirisu, Pinsir, Skiploom,
Noctowl and Stantler. Noctowl
will damage you if you give it
time to use Sky Attack, and it
can also put you to sleep. Other
than that, there aren't any
threats that you can't handle,
so long as you aren't being
careless. The main goal in this
test of patience type of level
is to find a statue.

Finding it will end the flag
dabbed level. Pace yourself in
the way you use your attacks and
manage your party as you just
have to hold off in this
mission. Take things step by
step, and though it'll still
take some time, the whole thing
will be manageable.



+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 9:THE MYSTERY OF THE
FOGBOUND LAKE[C9]
+-------------------------------

You should be at least level
20-21 here, and will have a
couple of dungeons to explore.
Upon finishing the two dungeons,
you will complete the chapter.
The steam cave has Magby
Snubbull, Slugma, Yanma,
Farfetch'd....damn I love that
pokemon- and Numel. Oh, and
there's a Kricketune or two.

The fire Pokemon here can burn
you and cause a tad bit of
unpleasantries, so keep a rawst
or two with you. Having a fire
type helps as fighting fire with
fire doesn't work here, and so
you'll have the same advantage,
and if you have water type,
things will be just as sweet.
There's a higher, or upper level
steam cave. The name? Upper
steam cave. I know, I would have
named it: Steam-cave-that-is-on-
a-higher-level-than-the-steam-
cave-that-you-just-passed-
through-and-it-will-be-called-
upper-steam-cave, cave. But hey,
I'm not the game developer here.
Level up at least tow levels up
before tackling this cave.

There's a boss at the end, so
don't give it your all at the
beginning. There are Kricketune,
Illumise, Yanma, Volbeat,
Shuckle, Magmar, and
Farfetch'd...oh sweet
Farfetch'd. Using offensive
items on Groudon is wise, as he
counters your moves. Keep on the
offensive, and you'll end up
dying quickly. Grab Magmar's
attention and take him out, also
with offensive items if you have
any. Fire Pokemon will get an
advantage when fighting Groudon,
and your water Pokemon will have
a problem, ironically. Play
slight offense-defense, and use
geo pebbles, and you should be
done.

+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 10:DUSKNOIR[C10]
+-------------------------------

When the talkative dust settles,
you'll be able to go to the Day
Care. You now have a spot to
place the eggs that you come
across. There's also a Xatu
Appraisal appraisactomy. NO!
Don't look up that word! Take my
word for it that it's a real
word. Mix together drinks at the
drink bar, and you've be able to
move to the next area. Move on
over to Serenity River when
you're done taking care of
business at your own pace. There
are some water Pokemon, Wooper,
Poliwag, Barboach, Lotad,
Masquerain. There, you can take
on the fairly easy Pokemon, and
farm the nice items you can find
there, and level up you guys,
and the guys you've shamefully
neglected, and as a result are
on lower levels.

Go through it more than once,
and from there, head over to
recycle some trade items at the
recycle shop. Do so three times,
and you'll then be able to move
on. Landslide Cave: Ampharos,
Granbull, Gible, Dustox,
Shuckle, Wormadam, and Venomoth
await you. Again, Venomoth is
still pretty dangerous, and you
may get into some random battle
encounters that could put a dent
in your battle plan. When done
with either that dungeon, or
some of the other tasks you can
go through, speak on over to
Chatot. He's gonna want you to
get some more Perfect Apples.

Head to the Chameleon Pokemon,
Kecleon over in treasure town,
and head back over to the boss
man Chatot. Move through and
scurry the place, kicking tail
and taking the names of the
aforementioned tail, head back
to the guild base, and you'll be
asked a favor from a couple of
the Marill family.

I'd level up to at least 24
before continuing to Amp Plains.
Some of the enemies there
include Plusle, Mareep, Minun,
Elekid/Electabuzz, Yanmega,
Flaafy, Girafarig, and Yanma.
I'm sure you already know, but
if you don't, Girafarig's name
is the same BOTH FORWARDS AND
BACKWARDS!!!!! When you're done
picking up the pieces of your
now blown mind, head in and
you've got a bunch of electric
Pokemon to deal with. If you
started with a ground Pokemon,
you'll laugh your way through,
but for everyone else, with the
appropriate levels, you
shouldn't have much trouble
making it through.

From there, you'll move through
Far Amp Plains. Some of the same
enemies are still here, with the
addition of Dorio and Taurus.
There's a boss on the tenth
floor, an electric boss, so
beware. It's Manectric. Take
each little Electrike on one by
one, and then take on the main
guy. I recommend bringing along
my favorite Pokemon, Geodude,
and leveling him up pretty well.

He'll rip through the electric
types like I rip DVD-
um...yeah.....then when you're
done, head over to the
Marillians and give then the
Water float. From there, talk to
your love interest, Dusknoir and
you'll transition to the next
chapter. Also, Dusknoir isn't
your love interest. I lied, I'm
sorry.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 11:[C11]GROVYLE THE
THIEF
+-------------------------------

When you finish speaking to
Chatot, head over for a meeting
in the prompted area. You've got
serious business to take care
of. Take care of any tasks you
can and level up a bit before
heading over to the Northern
Desert. A party of level 26
should be sufficient.

As it's a desert, you're going
to find primarily ground or
desert type Pokemon on your way
there, such as Cacnea and
Cacturne, Trapinch, Aron,
Lairon, Carnivine, Cubone,
Baltoy, Larvitar,and Sanshrew.
You've got a lot of floors to go
down, fourteen, or fifteen, I
think. There are restorative
items laying around, and should
take them before heading to
another floor. After heading
down through all of the floors-
it shouldn't be that hard with
the Pokemon there, just time
consuming, and a little taxing,
head over to your guild base
again. Speak to your guild
brethren, and then head over to
Quicksand Cave.

You needn't do much leveling
after going through the other
dungeon, but if you want to, all
the power to you. There, you'll
essentially get the evolved form
of some of the enemies you
fought in the desert like
Sandslash, Vibrava and Pupitar.
You can also run into Maile
Nincada and Skorupi. This
dungeon, or dungeons (the layout
is confusing, it's like two
stages, but not quite), and move
on to Quicksand pit. Now theres
Tyranitar, ouch!, Skorupi, and
Ninjasks. Mawile, and Pupitar
still litter the area, and there
are some Hippopotas to take out
as well.

There's still a good amount of
items laying around that you
should waste no expense in
using. If the sandstorm gets
harsh, just run on through to
the next floor, as you'll be
more likely to survive. There
can be some monster ambushes in
the levels if you aren't
careful, and though you may be
at the right level, just
focusing on getting to the next
floor is a pretty good idea.

If you haven't got to level 27
ish, then you can try taking out
the baddies on the earlier
floors for EXP, but the deeper
you get, the more risk you run
of getting ambushed. When you
head all the way down, you're
going to have to beat a
Legendary boss again. Damn. Now,
the major problem with Mesprit
is that it can fully heal itself
if you take your sweet time
defeating it, and it also starts
off with protect. Throw blast
seeds to take care of that
problem. After those two caveats
are considered, it's fair game
from there.

Just don't take to long to land
your attacks after breaking its
protect barrier and you should
be good to go.






+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 12:[C12]THE ONLY OPTION
+-------------------------------

As the title of the chapter
suggests, you're going to have
to go to the menu screen and
select options, then press the
only-heh heh, just kidding. In
the morning, head on over to the
guild to figure out where you're
going to explore next. I think
after beating that las t dungeon
you should be at sufficient
levels, but I was level 29 or 30
when tackling crystal cave.

That's the place your going to
have to head to. Bunch of high
defense Pokemon here, and most
are Rock. Whatever type they
are, most enemies aren't
pushovers here. Again, leveling
up at least one level before
getting deeper into the cave is
a great idea. Geodude
evolutions, Burmy evolutions,
Sheildon, Cranidos, Sevi, and
Bedlum are pretty strong here,
but still manageable.

After spelunking enough and
getting to the necessary level,
you'll have to match three
crystals to proceed. Who's the
voice in the game that's telling
you to do so? Um...me. Yeah, it
took some high technology, but I
was able to get into your game
to guide you. It was hard
fitting into the cartridge slot,
but I do what I can for my loyal
guide readers. Anyway, after
pondering that blatant lie, head
through crystal crossing.

A level higher than you were
when you entered crystal cave is
essential, and a couple of new
Pokemon join the fray. Bring
some healing items, and seeds of
the blast variety. There's a
boss at the end of the dungeon,
and the dungeon itself it pretty
long, so save the items you've
got.

Floatzel and Bagon can be
spotted here, along with four
legged friends Glameow, Absol,
and the lovely Glalie. Grovyle
is the boss of the dungeon, and
while I recommend having a lot
of healing items on you just in
case, it's better to hinder
Grovyle with stat enducers like
stunning him. Sleep or
paralyzing is great, but above
all, you want to attack him way
more than he attacks you, and
even if that isn't possible as
you're playing, quickly using
the healing items should ensure
that this red-or rather green-
hander crook is caught.





+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 13:SUSKNOIR'S
SECRET[C13]
+-------------------------------

Alright, head over to Dusknoir,
and also Magnezone and talk to
them. Clear up your backlog of
missions and to do list stuff
before you'll be able to
proceed. You need to complete
two missions before you'll be
able to speak to Magnezone.
Speak to Dusknoir, and DUN DUN
DUUUUUN, all hell breaks loose.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 14:[C14]
+-------------------------------

Dusknoir...why?!?! Any way,
you'll be going back to the
future this time around, without
all the motor vehicles and crazy
scientists you'd expect from
going back to the future. See
what I did there? Go over to the
door that's closed. After that,
chat up Grovyle, and give him a
response based on what you can,
and then you'll head over to
chasm cave.

Level 32's the level you should
be at least and as you keep
moving, watch for the flying
types like the Drifflon/blims
and Skarmory. Dittos, Onix and
Magneton are here as well, with
the addition of a grumpy pig-
grumpig. When you've shown the
cave who' boss, move through to
Dark Hill. There's mostly ghost
pokemon here, like the Gastly
family, Misdeavus and Dusclops.
Banettes, Gliscors, and Claydols
are here as well.

The thing that sucks about this
dungeon is that most of the
enemies can move through walls,
and the place is riddled with
traps. Anything to aid you
against traps is helpful, but
you're still going to get a
little overcrowded by mobs here.
The dungeon's also pretty long.

When you finally get through,
you'll be in the Sealed Ruin.
You should grind a bit before
heading here, though the
dungeon's not all that long.
Shellgon, Probopass, Muk,
Tangrowth and Metang are here,
but what you should watch out
for here is Forretress, because
of the powerful self-destruct.
There's a good amount of items
here, and the place is pretty
short.

When you're done, you'll head
into the deeper sealed ruin,
known as Deep Sealed Ruin. Stock
pile on your strongest
restoratives of your special
attacks before heading down to
floor 7, I believe. There's a
Spiritomb that wants to get its
butt kicked, but if you aren't
careful, you're will be kicked
in the process. Unload a barrage
of attacks onto Spiritomb with
your Pokemon, and just keep
attacking. Reason being, as soon
as Spiritomb uses Nasty Plot to
raise its special Attack, it's
going to be doing just too much
damage on you.

Keep impaling it with attacks,
and it should go down, heal when
needed, but if not absolutely
necessary, keep attacking.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 15:THE SECRET OF THE
PLANET'S PARALYSIS[C15]
+-------------------------------

Grovyle's now on your team, and
will aid you along Dusk Forest,
(I was level 36 when taking this
place on) There's just a hand
full of enemy Pokemon, and
Grovyle can seriously take out
the competition. Move through,
and you'll also get help from
Celebi when you head to deep
Dusk forest.

You can get a lot of item
collecting and exploring done if
you just let Celebi and Grovyle
do the dirty work, as they're
strong, but when sandstorms come
in, quickly run to the next
level. When you reach the ed,
bid farewell to Celebi, and
eventually, you'll be bidding
the place farewell as well.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 16: A NEW DAWN[C16]
+-------------------------------

Head to Grovyle, who should be
at Sharpedo Bluff, and then
you'll move onto Tree Shroud
forest. Level up at least a
level from having finished the
last dungeon, and then head
through the hordes of Houndoom,
Kadabra, Ralts, Alakazam,
Ninetales, and Vespiqen. There's
also a Cherrim or two here.

Note that this place is really
tough. There are a bunch of
traps and ambushes waiting for
you on every floor, and you may
have to finish this dungeon in a
couple of attempts. Bring a lot
of items with you, and after
heading through, Grovyle won't
be tagging along with you
anymore. Prpbably because that
dungeon was so darn hard.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 17:THE GUILD'S CREW[C17]
+-------------------------------

Rendezvous with your guild
brethren to figure out where to
head out to next. You're going
to make a familiar trip to a
familiar cave-steam cave, that
is. There aren't many troubles
here, as you've grown much
stronger since the first time
through. Head on over and talk
to the turtle Pokemon Torkoal.

He can be found near the Hot
Springs. The next day, head over
to Sharpedo Bluff, and speak
with your brethren. Then head on
over to the beach near the base.
It should be towards the bottom.


+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 18:LAPRAS[C18]
+-------------------------------

After you've had your
rudimentary conversations with
your pals at the guild, you're
going to have to go to Brine
cave. Chatot, the big boss man
who usually gives orders rather
than helps you out, will
actually help you out this time,
as he'll join your party. Then,
move over to to face the
primariliy water Pokemon. Do a
good deal of leveling till
you're in the 36-39 range.

Now, when it rains, the enemies,
specifically:Pelipper,
Gastrodon, Tentacool, Seel,
Staryu, Kingler and Dragonair
will get reaaally strong. Your
fire Pokemon won't stand a
chance, and Chatot isn't as
great as Grovyle and Celebi. Be
careful with each fight, as just
a slight bit f rain can dampen
your spirits and chances of
winning, but the dungeon isn't
particularly long. After you get
towards lower Brine cave, Chatot
will bid you adieu. Coward.

The new enemies here are Walrein
and Dewgong, but the place as a
whole is slightly harder than
the last. Leveling always helps,
and not necessarily by grinding,
just fight what you know you can
win against along the way. Now
the boss in this level is going
to be pretty hard, and I have a
couple suggestions as to how to
beat it. For one, you can level
up a lot and since the guys are
water/rock, obtain moves or
Pokemon that can take on these
types with ease. Alternatively,
you can use items to make
Kabutops or Omaster
incapacitated for a while, then
focus on the other. That should
make things that much more
manageable.



+-------------------------------
CHAPTER 19:TO THE HIDDEN
LAND[C19]
+-------------------------------

SURPRISE! Grovyle wants to help
you again. Just where the hell
were you when Chatot ditched us,
huh? Anyway, move to the Hidden
Land. Be on your guard, and on
level 41 or so. Head through,
and there will be third tier
touch heavy hitter Pokemon such
as Dragonite, Garphomp and
Abomasnow. Keep heading through,
and prove your mettle until you
get to the Hidden Highland.

If you had trouble with that
last part, I highly recommend
leveling up a bit because it
only gets harder from here.
There are essentially the same
Pokemon here, Tropious,
Magmortar, Manectric, Purugly
etc., but they are stronger.
There are a lot of floors, over
twenty, and the final floor has
a boss fight with DUN DUN
DUUUUN! Dusknoir. Hurry through
the floors, that's what I'd
suggest to do. Don't rush,
necessarily, but don't linger
either.

Now, you've also got a Sableye
to fight alongside Dusknoir.
You'd think he'd fight fair.
Anyway, you've bullied quite a
few Pokemon as well, so I guess
it's only right that they bully
you. Now, you're going to get
confused a lot if you don't
bring back up items...and that's
not good. Other than that, take
out the traitor, and show them
why you're know as the Master
Vanquisher of Abomination. Don't
ask.





+-------------------------------
THE FINAL ADVENTURE [C20]
+-------------------------------

Alright, you're ready for this.
Prep up to level 45ish. Anything
around there will do, but of
course, the higher the better.
The cellestial rock Pokemon,
Bronzor, and Porygon make an
appearance here. Now, head
through the short
floors....short doesn't mean
easy though, the enemies aren't
that diverse, but of course
they're strong. Keep moving
through and you'll get to the
Temporal Spire. Now there's
Salamence, Bronzong, Porygon-Z
and Metagross.

They're strong. Head through and
you will get into a huge bout
with Primal Dialga. There isn't
going to be another boss so
unleash your strongest of your
attacks on Dialga. Try cornering
him if you can, but he might end
up doing the same to you. Keep
up the immense barrage of
attacks, and you'll be
victorious. You've.......you've
done it!!!!

Now, the next day, you'll be
able to do a number of things
before you can actually say
you're done.

-After talking with your guild
 members, you'll be able to beat
 the living snot
out of your guild mates.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
-You'll be able to unlock the
 final episode after winning
-You'll be able to hold up to 48
 items, and speak to Chimeco to
 rearrange your
team at will
-You can now go back to
 previously visited dungeons.
Head out to the mystery
dungeons, take on quests, and
enjoy the ride!
