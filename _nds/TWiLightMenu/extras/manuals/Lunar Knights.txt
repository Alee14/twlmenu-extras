      CHAPTER 1: THE DARK SWORDS

================================

You begin the game in a pub,
overhearing two patrons
discussing the vampire menace
and the permanent night
shrouding the world. It seems
people are being treated like
cattle in the vampires' city,
carted off and drained of blood
until they turn undead. Staying
under the local vampire lord,
Margrave Rymer, isn't much
better - he hunts humans for
sport. Your character seems to
be looking for a different
vampire, but this is the only
lead he has, so off we go to
knock on (down?) his door...

[Front Gate]
- Barrel x2
~ Yellow Slime A x2

The first dungeon encompasses
the grounds in front of Rymer's
mansion. There are monsters
right off the bat, so your
familiar Nero explains how to
attack.

Now is also a good time to get
familiar with the controls. Your
character has an affinity for
moonlight, and conveniently it's
permanently night here. Hold A
to gather energy and fill up
your bar. The stronger the
light, the faster your energy
gauge will fill. The game will
explain more about energy when
you need to know.

A bit about enemies - they
always drop Soll, the currency
of this world, and occasionally
drop an item too. Check the
Enemies section for complete
enemy info. Most enemies respawn
if you leave the room; some only
if you go two rooms away. Right
now you don't receive any
experience points or items for
killing enemies, so don't worry
about that for now. They will
still drop money, though. The
denominations of money drops are
as follows:

Green Coin:       5 Soll
Bronze Coin:     10 Soll
Gold Coin:       50 Soll
Silver Crystal: 250 Soll
Gold Crystal:   500 Soll

The only enemies here are Yellow
Slimes, which are very docile
until you come into close
contact with them. If you touch
them or attack them, they'll
counter with a pouncing attack.
At your current strength they
take two hits to kill, so try
and finish them off with a one-
two combo to prevent their
counterattack.

[Outer Walkway]
! Sun Shards
! Hint Panel: Dashing
~ Crow A x2
~ Yellow Slime A x2
<NIGHT>
~ Ghoul A x2
<DAY>
~ Skeleton A x2

This room introduces a few new
things: first, spawning enemies.
These aren't visible when you
first enter a room. They appear
out of the ground when you
approach, or often as an ambush
when you go for a treasure
chest. These Ghouls will run
toward you when they're close
enough, so don't let their
apparent slowness fool you. They
also have a pouncing
counterattack, and they take
three hits to kill, so only a
full combo will avert it.
Blocking will be explained in
detail later, but for now if you
can't avoid one try and press B
before it hits you.

There are also Crows here, which
start off as easy targets on the
ground but have a quick diving
attack if you allow them to get
into the air.

Finally, you may see a green
glint appear on the ground.
That's a sign of Sun Shards. If
you get close enough, they will
surface and burst into firefly-
like creatures called Terra
Bugs, of which there are three
types:

Life Bug (green): Heals 5% of
your Life Spirit Bug (yellow):
Heals 5% of your Energy Spirit
Leech (black): Drains 2.5% of
your Energy

Very convenient in dungeons, and
the Leech variety are relatively
rare, so you should always seek
these out. They respawn if you
leave the room, and they'll come
to you if you hold A as if you
were charging energy. That
telltale sparkle only shows up
at night, though.

You can't proceed until you read
the hint panel about Dashing, so
go ahead and do that.

often holding rare or unique
items. The contents of some
chests can vary depending on
your situation. Some chests only
give you a particular item once,
so if you have already opened
the chest on a previous
playthrough then it will contain
a different item. Additionally,
some items cannot be obtained on
Normal difficulty.

Time for a story event. Bea is
here to rescue her captured
colleagues, but you couldn't
care less. At least you get to
give yourself a name now. Since
the default is Lucian (JP:
Sabata), that's what I'll be
using to refer to the Dark
Swordsman from now on.

[Hilltop]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Healing Potion
~ Crow A x3
~ Spider x6

Spiders show up in this room.
They're pretty docile - I don't
think I've ever been attacked by
one - but they lay invisible
webs that ensnare you until you
pull free. There are some
breakable wooden blocks
protecting chests, but as you
demonstrated during the last
cutscene, that won't stop you.
To the right is a room blocked
off by colored blocks. There are
six colors in all, each
representing an element, and you
need to use an attack with the
opposite element to break an
elemental block or hit an
elemental switch. Needless to
say you don't have any elemental
attacks yet, so you'll have to
come back later. For now head
left.

~ Yellow Slime A x2

Here Nero explains how to use
your shield. Your guard counter
decreases when you block, and if
it hits zero you'll be stunned
for a while. Fortunately, it
recovers when you're not using
it. Also, if you hit the guard
button right before an attack
(called a "Quick Guard"), you
won't lose any guard meter, and
you'll often stun the enemy or
reflect their attack back at
them. This is the best way to
deal with certain enemies.

You can practice on the Porks
here for a while, but be careful
not to stand near their bodies
after you kill them, as they
explode. This can sometimes work
to your advantage since it hits
other enemies too.

When you're comfortable with
guarding, stop by the room full
of breakables (south) before
heading north.

[Courtyard]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Skeleton B x2

It's a trap! Defeat the two
Skeletons to continue. They've
got a mean punch, so don't get
caught with your guard down.
It'll take quite a few hits
since they're level 3, but
they're not particularly fast.
Once you defeat them you'll
level up immediately and Nero
will explain the basics of
levels and status points. You
earn points every time you level
up which can be spent in three
categories: Vitality: Increases
your maximum Life Spirit:
Increases your maximum Energy
Skill: Increases your attack
power

You should distribute your
status points in the way that
best fits your own play style.
With Lucian, I almost never use
Energy and prefer strength over
defense, so I go for Skill alone
early on with a few points into
Vitality whenever I start losing
too much life from enemies.
Again, you should go with the
ratio that best supports the way
you play - there's no "right"
way to distribute the points.

Anyway, you can finally earn
experience now! Still no item
drops yet, though.

The enemies have all leveled up
now. Also new is the first
stationary enemy, the Lion

which can be blocked, but if
possible you should just sneak
by as fast as possible to reach
its vulnerable sides or back. A
combo or two should break it
apart.

It may be tempting to go right

when you approach it. You might
want to take out the Crows
first.

[Prep Room]

Whenever you see this kind of

stand next to it, allowing you
to heal your life to maximum.

You'll also get an explanation
of accessories here. Equip your
new armor and enjoy the extra
Life boost.

It wanders around leaping and
firing Sol Shots most of the
time. Try to stay out of its
direct line of fire and you
should be able to dodge most of
those. If you get close to it,
it may rear back and start
glowing. That's your cue that
it's going to bite. If you
manage to Quick Guard the lunge
you'll stun it, so try that if
you're daring. Otherwise, move
to the side and get a combo in.
You could just block and let
your guard counter soak up the
hit, but don't just stand there
or it will bite you and start
absorbing your Life. When its
tail grows four spikes and glows
red it's about to swing in a
large circle, so get your guard
up. If it glows red with a
single spike it will stab out in
one direction. If you hit it
right after an attack you should
always be able to get a full
combo in, and maybe another one
while it hunches over afterwards
if you're quick.

After your victory, you get a
call from Alice, who has been
monitoring your progress. She
suggests paying a visit to
Professor Sheridan, who knows a
great deal about alchemy and may
be able to unlock the dark
sword's true power.

----------------------------[ Sh

After charging in, you show the
sword to the professor. He needs
4 IRON and 2 SOLVENT to augment
the sword. Nero explains how to
interact with the world map, and
then you're given free control
over where to go next. You could
go ahead and storm Rymer's
mansion now, but you should
probably check out the town
first.

The IRON you need to upgrade
your sword is available at the
General Store. You can also get
it from Spiders, Red Slimes and
a chest in the mansion, but
you'll need so much of it to
fully upgrade all your weapons
that no amount you buy here will
go to waste. Items are plentiful
in dungeons, so you shouldn't
need to buy anything else here.
There are some accessories that
you probably can't afford yet,
but I prefer to save my money
for junk parts to use in weapon
upgrades.

Stop by the pub at the beginning
of each chapter for some helpful
advice and plot details. You can
also get your first quest from
the shopkeeper by talking to him
a few times. Check the Quests
section for more details about
quests.

Also, enemies will start
dropping items now, so you can
return to the Forecourt and get
some SOLVENT from Ghouls if you
want to upgrade your weapon
right away. Once you've
familiarized yourself with the
resources available at the town
and done any upgrading, head
over to the Hunting Mansion
proper.

You find yourself inside Rymer's

means you are cut off from the

energy. This is where those
Solar Fruits you picked up in
the previous dungeon will come
in handy.

Nero will explain the basics of
Terrennials and elemental
affinities here. Equipping a
Terrennial to your weapon will
add its element to your attack,
making it deal more damage to
enemies with the opposite
element and less damage to
enemies with the same element.
It just so happens that the
enemies right in front of you
are weak to Dark, so try it out.

You can't break the Cloud blocks
in the eastern room yet, so for
now make sure 7to grab the chest
from the broken staircase to the
north before proceeding west.

Here Nero will explain the

attacking enemies, and you can
unleash a powerful Trance attack
that changes depending on which
Terrennial you have equipped.

The Ghouls in these next few
rooms can drop Solvent for your
Vanargand. Watch out for the Axe
Armor statues. They may look
stationary, but they'll try and
take your head off if you walk
in front of them. Just as with
the Lion Statues, take these out
from the side.

in one combo. There are also
some pillars that shoot jets of
fire. Shouldn't have to tell you
that walking into them is not
the best idea.

find it useful.

Don't stand in front of his
drill. Even if you block, it'll
break your guard. If he points
his crossbow up, keep moving,
because flaming bolts are about
to land on your head. His
standard crossbow attack can be
blocked without too much
trouble, as well as deflected by
the pillars, but he also fires a
burst of grenades that cannot be
blocked. Watch them and make
sure you're not standing where
they land.

For a really easy time, go into
Trance with Nero and spam Y to
kill him.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

The battle's over, but you're
not done yet. Vampire's can't
truly be killed until they're
exposed to direct sunlight, and
since the paraSOL is preventing
that, you've got to drag his
coffin to OUTER SPACE!!!

You'll be switching to another
character soon. If you have
anything left to take care of in
town, select 'Hold on' at the
decision prompt. If you're ready
to move on, press left on the
control pad to select 'Ready!'.

Luckily, this time around you
have a giant robot to move the
coffin instead of just a chain.
Time for some space combat. The
minigame itself is pretty self-
explanatory - tap enemy ships to
shoot them and hold the stylus
on your own ship to move it
around. I'll just give a few
tips for the bosses:

Bomber: You have enough time to
get in a couple hits between
each of its shots. Move out of
the way right after it fires and
you won't get hit, but you still
need to dodge its charge once it
finishes a salvo. Be patient and
don't try to get too many hits
in at once and you'll be fine.

Schrödinger: She alternates
between two patterns. In the
first one she'll simply dodge
around the screen. Keep your
pointer trained on the ship and
you can get a bunch of free hits
in. Next she'll come in firing
rapid lasers, so just fly in
quick circles and you should
avoid most of it. When she's
down to about half health,
she'll start firing missiles.
Again, don't bother doing
anything but dodging during her
attack phase and you'll get
through the battle just fine.

Congratulations, you just
unlocked a new Terrennial. Time
to try it out!

The guild is under attack! Since
your gun isn't working, you'll
need to make your way out of the
building without fighting, and
save your comrades along the
way.

You can't get back in here once
your mission starts, but be sure
to pay a visit once you finish
the dungeon, as a very useful
shield is sitting in the next
room. There's a hidden chest
with some IRON in the top
corner.

Since you don't have a working
weapon yet, do your best to
avoid the Hounds while rescuing
the other guild members. With
Hounds as with any other
patrolling enemies, you can
whistle (blow into the
microphone) to call them over to
your location. If you ever need
them to stand on a pressure
switch or to move away from a
path you need to take, you can
call them over, but you have to
quickly run somewhere out of
their view or they'll spot you
and attack.

If you do happen to get spotted,
you can guard the Hounds' pounce
attack, but they have a short
recovery time, so your best
option is to leave the room and
come back. That will reset enemy
positions and give you another
chance to sneak past.

There's a guildsman right around
the corner to your left, so wait
for the nearby Hound to wander
off and sneak around the corner
to talk to him. He'll teach you
how to look farther off using
the X button. Head up and grab
the chest, then go upstairs.

[Hideout 2F South]

- Chest: Solar Fruit

Hang back until the nearby Hound
moves on. Use the X button to
check for Hounds before moving
to another pillar, and make sure
to grab the two chests before
taking the staircase down.

The exit is the door at the top,
but there are two more guild
members to be rescued first.
Make your way cautiously around
the boxes to the left side to
find the woman, then back around
to the right side and take the
staircase.

[Hideout 2F North]
! Guild Member

Once everyone is out, make your
way back downstairs to the
center, where a Hound is
standing guard in front of the
door. Whistle and run around
behind a group of crates and the
Hound should run out from its
hiding place - just make sure
the other one isn't nearby when
you whistle or it'll come
running too. Sneak behind the
guard (or just run, since they
won't follow you through doors)
and step out into the sunlight.

[Hideout Back Entrance] ! Event:

Bit of a story sequence. You now
have a working weapon! Pick a
name for your character (I'll be
calling him Aaron) and get
acquainted with your newfound
terrennial, Toasty (JP: Otenko).

Aaron plays quite differently
than Lucian. You will want to do
most of your fighting from a
safe distance, and you have to
keep elemental resistances in
mind since you can't fire a
Solar Gun without a terrennial
equipped. This means that you
have to pay more attention to
your ENE than you would with
Lucian, so you may want to focus
on Spirit more than Vitality.
Skill still takes top priority
for me, though. It should come
as no surprise that Aaron
gathers his energy from the sun
rather than the moon, and you
don't have much ENE to start
with, so indoor areas will be
more of a challenge.

To automatically lock-on to the
nearest enemy, hold R. Release
and hold it again to switch to
the next enemy if there is one.

If you haven't noticed the
freshness meter yet, it's a
little circle next to item names
in your inventory. In the last
chapter items never went bad,
but now you have to keep track
of your perishables. For
instance, an Earth Fruit heals
30% of your Life but can rot,
while a Candy Drop only restores
20% of your Life but never goes
bad. It's possible to preserve
some items in certain weather
conditions (check the Item
Conversions section), but for
now, just keep in mind that if
you dawdle for too long you'll
start losing your perishables.

[Back Alley South]
- Chest: Milk
~ Black Slime A x3

Here Toasty will explain the
lock-on feature. The Black
Slimes are weak to Sol, which is
good, because that's all you can
shoot for now. There's a green
chest across the canal, but
we'll get around to it later.

Toasty explains his Trance
attack here. Pretty much the
same as Nero's, but Sol element.
This room also introduces the
nasty Crater enemy, which lobs
grenades at you from a distance.
Keep moving and fire a shot off
each time you avoid a grenade.
They have a large splash damage
area and fly fast, so don't
stand still for too long or
you'll be blasted. Try and use X
so that you can just barely see
a Crater, lock on, then fire at
it from offscreen (and outside
its range). Take the leftmost of
the two remaining exits for this
room.

Grab the junk part from the
chest and return to The Loop,
this time taking the far right
exit.

[Back Alley North]
~ Crow A x2
~ Pork A x2

You're barely going to do any
damage to the Porks since
they're Sol elemental. Not much
you can do about that but hammer
the fire button and block when
they charge, or just avoid
fighting them entirely.

[Side Street]

near the left end.

Meet your next vampire foes,
Edgar and Virginia Poe. The
guild leaders will show up and
hold them off while you help

you can't reach until you finish
this chapter.

- Chest: Healing Potion
- Barrel x3
- Trash x6
- Jar x4

This area is inaccessible during
your first visit to 13th Street,
but it's a great place to find
breakables on a return visit.

[Rooftops South]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Trash x2
~ Black Slime B x3
~ Crow B x6
~ Hound x1
~ Pork B x4

Stop by the room at street level
to rescue a guild member.

[Storage Room]
! Sun Shards
! Guild Member

Go back outside and head
upstairs. There's a room to the
south but you can't access it
yet, and neither can you reach
the guild member on the other
side of a fence in this room, so
head north.

[Glider Room] ! Earth blocks
blocking the entrance ! Glider:
lets you cross a gap at wind
speeds above 13.4 mph (6 m/s)
- Green Chest:
  · Hresvelgr Arms (first time)
  · Yogurt
- Barrel x2

[Rooftops North]
- Green Chest:
  · Power Fruit
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time 
~ Black Slime B x4
~ Skeleton B x4

Grab the Power Fruit from the
chest. If you're worried about
it rotting and don't want to
waste it, rearrange your items
so that there's a Chocolate
directly above it and allow the
Chocolate to melt. The resulting
item won't rot and it'll be
twice as powerful too. Go left
and south to enter the fenced-
off section of the rooftops that
you passed by earlier.

[Rooftops South]
! Guild Member
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Crate x3
~ Black Slime B x4
~ Crow B x2

Another guild member to rescue
here; not much else. Go back to
Rooftops North and start heading
right, down the stairs. Head
through the door to enter the
building you were just walking
on.

[The Lodge]
~ Chloroformin' x2
~ Pork B x2

Make your way up the stairs.

[Rooftops North]
! Sun Shards x5
! Guild Member
- Crate x2
- Jar x3

Lots of Sun Shards up here, but
watch out for the trapdoors.
Talk to the last guild member
and make your way back out of
the building. Head right to
reach the exit.

[Concourse Center]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Milk
- Invisible Chest: Earth Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Crater x5
~ Pork B x4
~ Skeleton B x6

More Craters in the top half of
the room. There are invisible
chests in the southern corners.
You can't return to Concourse -
South, so go right.

[East Court]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
~ Hound x2

More loot. At this point you
should be strong enough to take
out the Hounds without much
trouble. Return to Concourse -
Center and make your way through
the bombardment up to the next
room.

[Concourse North]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Barrel x2

The escapees are being held up
by another chimera. Aaron to the
rescue!

        *--------------*
        | Goat Chimera |
        *--------------*
         Element:  Dark

The snake tail spits gobs of
poison. You can knock them away
by guarding, but the chimera
won't be affected. It will growl
when it's preparing to charge.
Don't try to guard its charge,
as it'll just knock you over.
It's pretty fast, so you may
want to actually run out of the
way. Don't let it get too close
either, or you'll be hit by its
poison breath attack. If you can
get it to charge into a pole
it'll be stunned for a couple
seconds, so use them for cover.
You can get a lot of hits in
while it's stunned or using its
poison breath attack, and you
can try to get some in between
its other attacks but that's
more risky.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Rendezvous with Bea and that
concludes Aaron's introductory
mission.

================================

      CHAPTER 3: WITH SWORD AND 

================================

Lucian is again hanging out in a
pub in search of information,
and it just happens to be the
one in Old Culiacan. Bea enters
with a lead on Ernest and Kay's
location and drags Lucian into
the rescue mission along with
Aaron. You now have control of
both characters! Switch between
them with Select during gameplay
or by tapping the portrait in
the start menu. She also hands
over the Witch and Ernest's
Solar Goggles. Check out the new
wares and quests available, then
head into the sewers. You may
want to select the Arid Desert
climate before entering, as it
will unlock some extra treasure.

helpful to use R-targeting to
find Bats and pick them off from
a distance.

That suspicious-looking chest
between four pillars is indeed
an ambush. If you grab the fruit
and keep moving you can get
outside the Ghoul perimeter
before they finish spawning and
fight them without getting
surrounded.

Alice will contact you to
explain Weather Statues. They
indicate that a nearby path is
only accessible under certain
weather conditions - you don't
need to be in any particular
climate so long as the
conditions are in the correct
range, but changing the climate
is the surest way to activate
the path. You could also try a
burst attack with the
appropriate terrennial to change
the weather temporarily. As for
the particular statue in front
of you, it will glow when the
temperature is hot enough,
indicating that the water has
evaporated. This allows you to
walk down there and grab the
previously submerged chest. You
may have to re-enter the room to
show the effects of the new
temperature. Once you have the
chest, you can leave and switch
back to Balmy Subtropical if you
want.

You have a choice of going left
or right here. The left side
contains a key that you'll need
later on, so take the bridge to
the left side. Before you leave
the room, there's a switch you
can hit that will lower the
drawbridge, providing a shortcut
back to the entrance.

Lots of ice enemies in this
room. There's also an elemental
switch in the left corner which
raises the gate at the top when
hit with a Flame-element attack.
Make sure to grab the Red Key
from the chest there before
returning to the previous room
and heading right.

~ Yellow Slime A x7

A new enemy to watch out for
here: Cannons. They're
stationary but fire powerful
shots. The best way to deal with
them is to attack them from an
unprotected side. If you need to
cross in front of a cannon, do
it quickly, and have your shield
ready. If your timing is good
enough, you can even deflect the
shot back at the cannon to
damage it.

Shoot the switch to lower a
bridge between the two Cannons.
Before you cross over to the
right side, grab the chest
across from the first Cannon. On
a thin bridge between the two
sides is a group of mushrooms
that only fully bloom in Balmy
Subtropical conditions. These
drop the rare Endurance Fruit.

Stop by the treasure room to the
south before continuing north.
There are some Popbuds here.
They fire spines in all
directions when they die, so
face them and hold up your
shield to avoid getting hit.

If you picked up the Red Key
before coming here, use it on
the door to proceed.

There's an invisible chest to
your immediate right as you
enter the room. Break the boxes
and look north. See that switch?
Shoot it to lower the bridge. In
the next section, there's an
invisible chest in the right
corner. Hitch a ride on the
moving platform. Be careful not
to fall off (and be patient
getting on), because one misstep
means instant Game Over and
having to start over from the
beginning of the room. There's a
room to the east with an
accessible Solar Station but the
rest is blocked off for now.

[Central Nexus]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Lizardman A x2

These guys can be tough if you
try to attack them head on. If
you try to shoot them from a
distance they'll swing their
ball and chains in quick circles
and reflect your shots back at
you, and if you try to move in
close you'll probably get hit by
the swing or returning ball.
Instead, stand in front of one
as it twirls the ball. As soon
as you see it reach back to hurl
the projectile, put up your
shield. If you manage to Quick
Guard the attack, you'll knock
the ball into the Lizardman's
head, stunning it and allowing
you to slice it up. It might
seem intimidating at first, but
once you get the hang of it
they'll only pose a problem in
groups.

There are some Frost blocks in
the way. Luckily you have the
Flame terrennial, so equip it
and break through. You won't be
able to get through the Flame
block on the left side for a
while, but remember the
location. You'll need to come
back to get one of Lucian's
weapons.

More moving platforms. Take your
time. While riding the second
moving platform you'll have an
opportunity to shoot at some
cannons on lone pillars in the
water. Take them out now and you
won't have to deal with them on
the platform that crosses in
front of them. The X button
helps.

Between the second and third
platforms there's an exit to
another area. You can't get
through the area on the other
side yet, so don't bother.
Instead, continue north.

    *---------------------------
    |Viscount Edgar & Viscountes
    *---------------------------
     Element: Cloud & Earth



Edgar is immune to Aaron's
attacks and Virginia is immune
to Lucian's. If you have a
favorite character you can
choose him and only focus on one
Poe, but otherwise you'll be
switching between them depending
on who you're attacking. They
share the same lifebar, so you
don't even have to hit the other
one to win, although they attack
as a tag team so there will only
be one of them on screen at a
time.

Edgar attacks using punches, and
Virginia attacks with kicks.
Keep moving and let them charge
past you, then hit them in the
back when you hear the stunned
sound after their attacks. If
you can't avoid an attack, block
and you may be able to avoid the
damage. They're not too hard to
take down, but they're not done
just yet...

      *-----------------*
      | Twin Poefighter |
      *-----------------*
         Element: None

Their fused form alternates
between both of their attacks,
and is faster to boot. Keep up
the same strategy until it's
down to about half health, at
which point it can start
charging up energy. Don't get
behind it or it will cancel the
attack and grab you for an
extended combo. Stay in front of
it until it finishes charging,
at which point you should run to
either side and block. If you
stay in the middle the energy
balls will arc and hit you from
both sides (they seek), so you
need to be to one side to block
both of them.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

It's time to purify them. This
time around, you have the use of
both Toasty and Ursula during
the Shooting Battle segment.
Toasty fires low-power but
rapid- fire and fast-moving
bullets, and Ursula fires
powerful missiles with splash
damage. Hold a trigger button to
bring up the terrennial
selection menu and use the
control pad to switch between
them. For single regular orange
enemies, Nero is still the most
efficient choice, but Ursula is
better for groups and green
enemies that take multiple hits
to kill. Toasty is good against
bosses but consumes energy
rapidly.

If you see a blue enemy, quickly
switch to Ursula and fire a
missile that will take it out in
one hit. Use the trigger buttons
if you're ever feeling
overwhelmed for some time to
assess the situation.

During the asteroid segments,
make sure to kill the enemies
for recovery items.

Mid-boss: Don't bother shooting
when its arms are closed, as it
won't take any damage. Toasty
works well here. It will
alternate between diving at you
(move out of the way!) and
moving in an S-curve (keep out
of its way!).

Heavy Schrödinger: Heavy means
not very fast, so Ursula can be
used here for maximum efficiency
when she's between movements.
You should still follow the same
general strategy as the previous
form - attack during the
movement phase and dodge during
the machine gun phase - but this
time she will be firing missiles
from the start and during both
phases. This means that you need
to alternate between moving and
firing off a missile during your
attack phase. She does have a
slight pause after the machine
gun phase in which you can get
in an attack, so take advantage
of that.

Once it's over, finish off the
twins and accept your TWO new
terrennials and climates.

================================

      CHAPTER 4: A REASON TO FIG

================================

You now have access to a
significant number of areas you
couldn't reach before, so it's
time to do some backtracking
before moving on with the story.
Don't worry, they'll still be
waiting for you. When you do
decide to head to the train
station, the Tropical Rainforest
climate will unlock the greatest
number of paths.

[Entrance]

What are you waiting for? Head
on in.

[Lobby]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Clairvoyance 
- Crate x4
~ Clay Golem A x2
~ Lizardman A x2

If you can make it through the
start of this dungeon without
getting spotted, the
announcements over the
loudspeaker will be slightly
different. Not sure if it
actually affects anything other
than that, though. I just fought
my way through.

This dungeon introduces the
strong Clay Golem monsters. If
they spot you they'll curl up
into a ball and roll at you.
Quick Guard this attack to stun
them, or if you're strong
enough, kill them before they
can reach you. It helps if they
don't notice you before you
start attacking.

Don't miss the invisible chest
in the top corner next to the
staircase.

[Ticket Counter]
! Sun Shards
- Hidden Chest: Earth Fruit
- Hidden Chest: Solar Fruit
- Barrel x2
- Crate x5
~ Clay Golem A x6

There are two chests in this
room that you can't see from the
camera angle. On the top wall of
the area there are two sections
that jut out into the room (they
look a bit like information
booths). The right side of each
booth is fully visible but the
left side is obscured from your
perspective; the chests are each
located in one of those hidden
corners.

Head south to a small room with
two divided cells. This is
probably the area the prisoners
escaped from. Just missed them!

[Holding Cells]
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest:
  · Cure Bulb
  · Sound Data DEMO 3 (Hard Mode
- Invisible Chest: Stealth Fruit
~ Aero Ghoul x2
~ Petro Ghoul x4
~ Purple Slime A x3

Watch out for Ghouls to spawn as
you're leaving a cell. Once
you've cleared out the place,
return to Ticket Counter and
head north this time.

[Southeast Terminal]
! Sun Shards
- Invisible Chest: Restorative
- Jar x2
~ Clay Golem A x2
~ Lizardman A x3

Grab the invisible chest in the
alcove formed by the boxes
dividing the room. The door to
the next terminal is gated shut.
Looks like you'll be going the
long way around...

[Staircase 1 South]

Nothing to do here. Take the
stairs.

[Platform 1]
! Skylight x2
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Luggage x4
~ Clay Golem A x1
~ Ghost A x4
~ Lizardman A x2

Watch out for the Ghosts in this
room. If they manage to touch
you they'll nab one of your
items and run off with it. Use
R-targeting to lock on even when
they're invisible.

[Staircase 1 North]

Looks like somebody made a mess
of the place. Move forward.

[Northeast Terminal]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Lizardman A x3

Story event. Collect the Ninja
and keep moving.

[Staircase 2 North]
! Solar Station

Recharge your energy if you
want, then head downstairs
again.

[Platform 2]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards
! Cloud blocks
! Flame blocks
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Luggage x3
~ Green Slime x4
~ Orc x4
~ Purple Slime B x5

At the end of this room, hit the
switch with an Earth attack to
lower the spikes. Stop by the
open train car on your way
there.

[Open Train 2 Car]
- Chest: random Ryuusei item (af
- Chest: Emerald
- Luggage x4

Goodies. In the Tropical
Rainforest climate, Luggage
piles turns into single packages
which drop very expensive items
that you can sell for Junk Part
purchasing funds.

Return to the platform and
continue on to the stairs.

[Staircase 2 South]

Nothing to do here. Head out the
door.

[Southeast Terminal]
~ Purple Slime A x7

Walk up next to the spikes and
look left. See that switch?
Shoot it to lower the spikes and
continue to the next room.

[Staircase 3 South]

You know the drill.

[Platform 3]
! Skylight x2
- Luggage x3
~ Ghost B x7
~ Ghoul x4
~ Green Slime x5
~ Hot Ghoul x4
~ Pork Cannon x6
~ Purple Slime B x2

Stop by the train car on the way
through.

[Open Train 3 Car]
- Green Chest:
  · Dried Meat
  · Sound Data DEMO 4 (Hard Mode
- Luggage x4

More goodies!

[Staircase 3 North]

Keep on movin'.

[Northwest Terminal]
~ Clay Golem B x2
~ Toadstool x1

! Solar Roots: grow across a gap
at 75% humidity and above
- Chest: IRON
- Chest: IRON
- Chest: STEEL
- Chest: STEEL

Shoot the Toadstool from a
distance to avoid getting
poisoned. Grab the Junk Parts if
it's humid enough for the plants
to grow across the gaps, then
keep going.

[Staircase 4 North]

Staaaairwaaaaay....

[Platform 4]
! Sneaking section
! Skylight x2
- Chest: Healing Potion
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Spotter x7

Time for another sneaking
sequence. This, too, is
optional, as if you're strong
enough you can just kill the
Spotter robots when they try to
apprehend you (but be warned, if
the alert timer hits zero, it's
an instant Game Over). If you
get seen, try to hide behind a
pillar and wait for the cooldown
timer to run out. There are
other Spotters later on in the
game, but make sure you kill at
least one of them to get the
Enemy list entry. If you're
going for stealth, stick to the
center and weave in between the
rows when a Spotter comes by. If
you make it to the switch
without getting seen, hit it to
end the stealth segment.

[Staircase 4 South]

Story event. Stairs.

[Southwest Terminal]
! Earth blocks
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Skeleton Archer x6
~ Spider x4

Finally, on the other side of
that gate. Break through the
Earth blocks with a Cloud attack
and get ready for a lot of
enemies to appear. These
Skeleton Archers draw back the
bow before loosing an arrow at
you. Quick Guard to deflect the
arrow at an enemy, and with the
Red Cross shield you can even
heal yourself in the process.
Hit the regular switch to raise
the gate, then hit the Earth
switch with a Cloud attack to
activate the moving platform on
the other side of the room.
Don't bother with the lower room
yet, as it's blocked from the
other side.

! Ice Switch ! Cloud block
blocking the door to Storage
Room
- Crate x2
~ Orc x9

The platform will take you
straight across the pit to the
other side. If you want to
access the room to the south,
you'll need to shoot the Ice
Switch halfway through the ride
with a Flame attack to activate
the other platform.

Either way, once you make it to
the other side a ton of Orcs
will spawn. If you're not
prepared for a close-quarters
battle, just flip the switch and
escape to the upper room.

[Back Room] ! Flame blocks
blocking the entrance ! Sunken
Platform (floats up during
rainfall)
- Green Chest:
  · Nidhoggr Arms (first time)
  · Garnet

[Storage Room] ! Sun Shards !
Solar Roots: grow across a gap
at 75% humidity and above
- Green Chest:
  · Battle Suit (first time)
  · Magic Bulb
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Ghost B x3
~ Spider x3

[Staircase 5 South]

Finally, the last empty
staircase room in the station.

[Prep Room]
! Sun Crystal
! Solar Station

Story event. Looks like you'll
have to fight the Duke atop his
castle. You won't be able to
return to town until you've
finished the next dungeon, so
now is the time to return and
make any necessary preparations.
Assuming you opened the gate
between the two southern
terminals, it will be a much
shorter trip back to the boss
room when you return. When
you're ready, step forward into
the boss room.

[Boss Room]
~ Lizardman B x3

You have one minute to finish
off the three Lizardmen. Try not
to let them surround you. If
you've been practicing the Quick
Guard technique you should be
able to take them out one by one
well within the time limit.

[Back Railing]

Not so much a room as the
railing on the back of the
train. Better get going.

[Dining Car]
- Green Chest: GUNPOWDER
- Invisible Chest: Magic Drop
- Invisible Chest: Cure Drop

Thankfully the game doesn't
leave you completely without
supplies. There's a Traveling
Merchant in here with a well-
stocked inventory. You can also
press A at a table to refill
your Life. It even revives dead
characters, so this is an
excellent place to visit if you
need some healing between
dungeons. Don't miss the
invisible chests in the corner
behind the merchant and inside
the bend in the counter.

[Passenger Car A]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Orc A x4
~ Petro Ghoul x4

Clear the room and move on.

[Passenger Car B]

! Sun Shards
~ Ghoul A x7
~ Petro Ghoul x5

Clear the room and move on.

[Passenger Car C]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
! Sun Shards
~ Skeleton Fencer A x6

New enemy here: Skeleton
Fencers. These things are very
fast, so if you're trying to
guard their attacks, do it as
soon as or even before you see
them draw back or you'll get
sliced. They've got a sword
thrust counterattack if you
don't finish them off in one
combo, so watch out for that
too. The easiest strategy is to
take them out from a distance
with Aaron.

[Boxcar]

Time to face... a giant enemy
crab?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

        *--------------*
        | Baron Stoker |
        *--------------*
         Element: Frost

His pattern is actually pretty
easy. He's weak to Flame, but
most of the time his claws are
covering his vulnerable body.
When he lifts one claw to
attack, it's your job to attack
the other one with the opposite
element (hit the Dark claw with
Toasty and the Sol claw with
Nero) and he will raise it as
well. Once both claws are out of
the way you can attack his weak
point for massive damage. If
you've been upgrading the Ninja
it works very well here.

His attacks consist mostly of
slow-moving Sol and Dark
flamethrowers (depending on
which claw is raised). If you
get too far away he will fire
missiles, which you can dodge by
weaving back and forth or
standing in the corner next to
him.

After losing 50% of his lifebar
he'll start using a Frost beam
attack. The beams will freeze
you if you get hit, but you can
guard them. Afterwards he will
charge at you. It's a certain
Guard Break if you block, but at
least you won't take any damage.
Run back to the entrance of the
area to completely avoid it, or
run to one of the sides. As long
as you aren't touching his claws
you'll be pushed back without
getting hurt.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Time to purify Stoker. This
round will be a test of your
ability to quickly react to
different enemy patterns. Use
Nero on single enemies, Ursula
on close groups or blue/purple
enemies, and Alexander on lines.
Use Tove as a shield if you're
overwhelmed and about to be hit
by the fast-moving missiles.

Ursula still works very well on
the Bomber mid-boss. Just move
slightly after it starts firing
to avoid getting hit.

Ursula works well on the puncher
too, but stay out of the middle
since it has a new diving
attack. If you see it fly
straight offscreen in a
particular direction, it will
come flying back across the
screen in the opposite direction
immediately afterwards.

Armored Schrödinger: Use the
same strategy against the rapid
lasers. If she reels back for a
kick, move to the top of the
screen. If the wings fly off and
attach to the front and she
begins charging for a powerful
laser attack, hit each one with
an Ursula to knock it off and
render her vulnerable again.

And with that, you now have the
last terrennial and climate! On
top of that, you get the Dragoon
gun from Ernest.

Stand on the pressure switch and
whistle, then wait for the Stone
Golem to start rolling. Run
around the opposite side of the
wall from it so that it doesn't
see you, then run across the
spikes to the chest. The switch
will lower the spikes
permanently.

hit the Pork Cannon Mk. IIs from
the side.

Don't miss the invisible chests
behind the Pork Cannon Mk. IIs.

[Rest Area]
! Citizen: Level-Headed Woman
! Solar Station

The woman here will give you a
quest to bring an item to the
man in small area set off from
the main section of Entrance.
You'll have to do it in order to
get past the gatekeeper ahead,
so go take care of that.

There's also a space for a lift
to the Fountain here, but you'll
be activating it from the other
side. It's a nice shortcut on a
revisit, though.

If you lowered the spikes from
the Glider Room, head down the
middle for easy access.
Otherwise, have your shield
ready to parry the Cannon
attacks as you move up one of
the outer rows.

[Lower Gate] ! Citizen:
Fearless/Daring Gatekeeper

If you haven't completed the
Level-Headed Woman's mission he
won't have anything to do with
you. Otherwise he'll let you
through if you can manage to
retrieve a spare bottlecap from
the warehouse without getting
spotted.

[Warehouse] ! Mission: Get the
spare bottlecap without being
discovered! ~ Stone Golem x3

You cannot get caught here or
it's instant Game Over. Use a
Stealth Fruit if you don't want
to bother. When you get near the
top left corner, whistle to pull
the guard away and move around
the opposite side of the wall.
Grab the chest and the mission
ends immediately.

[Rooftops West]

Story event. Keep going.

[Rooftops East]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Chest: Magic Potion
- Lamp x3
~ Cannon B x2
~ Skeleton Fencer B x1

This area can be a bit tricky.
If you want to be as safe as
possible, take out the cannons
by deflecting their shots back
to them. You could also use
Witch, but don't forget to guard
if they fire as you move in
front of them. If you just want
to get through as fast as
possible, guard as you move past
the cannons then quickly turn
around and fire a Cloud shot at
the switch before turning to
guard again. Once you hit the
switch the platform will make a
second trip (to the exit) after
its first one (to the treasure).

You're not far from the Duke
now. The tower has a lot of
floors, though, so it will take
plenty of work to get to the
top.

----------[ Auguste 1F ]--------

The first floor is divided into
four sections, one for each
element. Each section is blocked
off by the weather obstacle that
corresponds to its affinity, so
you're forced to fight each
section's enemies when they're
powered up by their element
(unless you use a burst after
you get through).

[Entrance Hall]
! Skylight x4

Story event. Not much to do here
but charge up your energy.

[Climate Trial]

There are four pedastals here,
each corresponding to a
particular climate. You don't
need to do these in any
particular order, and the
switches will stay activated if
you leave the castle, so feel
free to go change the climate
after each section. At the end
of each segment is an elemental
orb which you must activate, and
a teleporter which will bring
you back to the main passage.
I'm going to cover the sections
in clockwise order, starting
with Flame in the southwest.

Set your climate to Arid Desert.
If the temperature's below 86ºF
or (30ºC), wait until daybreak
and use a Burst attack with
Ursula. It needs to be hot for
you to get through the next
room. Bring a couple
Clairvoyance Fruit if you want
an easier time.

your whistle and run over to the
switch, opening the gate.

Trapdoors here too. The
elemental orb can actually only
be reached by falling through
one, so either use a

one closest to the door, or
(starting from the door) travel
along the left wall until you
fall in.

[Lower Chamber]

It needs to be humid enough for

to get hit by the poisonous jets
(they can be blocked with your
shield).

If you don't like floating
platforms, this section is gonna
be torture.

[Rainforest Corridor] !
Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud x3
~ Popbud x4

Pretty simple at first; take the
platforms one at a time and be
patient. When you get to the
area with the Popbuds, be
careful with your aim. You want
all the switches to be set to
Cloud. If you happen to hit a
Popbud by mistake, just face it
and keep your shield up to avoid
getting knocked off the
platform.

have to start the room over. I
find it's easiest to get through
by using X to look ahead and
take things out before you move
into their range.

When you reach the center, hit
the orb with a Cloud attack and
teleport out.

Be careful here; there are

You need to step on the switch

nice map with instructions made
by omegadestroyer7, which can be
found here: http://i15.photobuck
et.com/albums/a362/omegadestroye

In case it doesn't show up, I'll
give step-by-step directions.
From the entrance, move right
two squares so that you are at
the far right corner of the non-
icy area. This is the point from
which you will enter the icy
floor. Move DR, UR, DR, DL. You
should now be next to two
blocks. Destroy the first one,
then move DL, UL. You should be
between two blocks. Destroy the
right one to open the area with
the switch. Step on it, then
head DL, U to return to the non-
icy area. Get in position at the
far right again. Move DR, DL, R,
DL, DR. If you did it right
you'll now be in front of the
elemental orb.

Confusion can be deadly here.

react quickly when the wind
changes.

At least the area around the

It's pretty similar to the other
chimeras you've fought, except
that it can switch elements
between Flame and Frost. In its
Flame form it shoots fireballs
and in its Frost form it
breathes icy breath, but other
than that the forms are
basically identical. It pounces,
and its tail spits poison or
bites. The poison can be
deflected back but the fireballs
can't. After a few attacks it
will sit down and spit a series
of projectiles (meteors or ice
crystals) straight up. They'll
fall down on your current
position, so keep moving. After
using this attack it switches
elements. As with the other
chimeras, combos will stun it.

After losing 50% of its health
it will be able to pounce twice
in a row.

[Element Trial]

After going through each of the
climates you're probably sick of
the elements. Well, too bad,
because the second floor
consists of three segments that
each deal with an opposing pair
of elements. There are no
climate requirements for these
so pick whichever one you like.
I'll cover the rooms from left
to right.

----------[ Auguste 2F: Flame/Fr

[Flame/Frost Corridor]
~ Orc x2
~ Pork x5

Make your way through to the
main area for this section.

[Yellow Room]
! Yellow Key Door
- Barrel x4
~ Librarian x3
~ Skeleton x8
~ Vampire Bat x7

The orb is nearby but it's
blocked by a locked door, so
you'll have to go through a few
rooms to find the key.

[Block Trial]
! Frost block
! Elemental Switch: Flame/Frost
! Flame block
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
! Cloud block x2
! Earth block
- Green Chest: FANG
~ Serpent Statue x6
~ Urchin x3

In this room, whenever you
change a switch to a particular
element, all of the blocks of
that element will respawn. You
can use this to your advantage
by blocking the Urchins on the
other side.

If you need specific directions:
start by destroying the first
block, then hit the switch.
Destroy the next block to
release the Urchin, then hit the
switch again when the Urchin is
at the top of the screen to
respawn the block and trap it.
Continue to the next row. Hit
the switch, then destroy both
blocks at the same time. Hit the
switch again when the Urchins
are at the bottom of their path
to trap them. Then you can
destroy the final block and grab
the chest at leisure.

[Sneaking Trial]
! Sun Shards
! Blue Chest: Yellow Key
~ Serpent Statue x3
~ Spotter x3

You can choose from two paths
here. The lower path contains
flame jets and Spotter robots,
and the upper path contains
Serpent Statues and icy floors.
The switch is in the bottom
corner, so pick your preferred
path and make your way there. If
you missed getting the enemy
list entry for Spotter back in
Santa Cecilia Station, you may
want to kill one here. Make sure
to grab the key from the chest
before leaving or you'll have to
do this whole section over
again.

[Flame/Frost Room]

Hit the orb with either element
and teleport out.

----------[ Auguste 2F: Sol/Dark

[Sol/Dark Corridor]
~ Orc x2
~ Pork x5

Make your way through to the
main area for this section.

[Red Room]
! Red Key Door
~ Librarian x3
~ Skeleton x8
~ Vampire Bat x5

The orb is nearby but it's
blocked by a locked door, so
you'll have to go through a few
rooms to find the key.

[Dark Trial]
! Dark Area
! Hint Panel: Dark Areas
! Elemental Switch: Sol/Dark
- Blue Chest: Red Key
- Invisible Chest: Solar Fruit
- Amber x1
- Jar x2
~ Vampire Bat x15
~ Wraith x3

Careful with these Wraiths - if
they latch on to you they'll
drain your energy pretty
quickly. Don't stop when you
reach the exit - you need to
keep exploring the rest of the
maze to find the key you need.

[Balance Trial]
! Sun Shards
- Barrel x2
~ Vampire Bat x10
~ Wraith x3

You might want to use Aaron here
to take out the Vampire Bats
from a distance, as they can
easily knock you off the pipe.

[Sol/Dark Room]

Hit the orb with either element
and teleport out.

----------[ Auguste 2F: Earth/Cl

[Earth/Cloud Corridor]
~ Orc x2
~ Pork x5

Make your way through to the
main area for this section.

[Blue Room]
! Blue Key Door
- Crate x1
- Jar x4
~ Librarian x3
~ Skeleton x8
~ Vampire Bat x7

The orb is nearby but it's
blocked by a locked door, so
you'll have to go through a few
rooms to find the key.

[Pillar Trial]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Green Chest: GENERATOR
~ Pillar x8

Shoot the elemental switch in
the middle when you pass by it
as you make your way clockwise
to the exit. It will change
which group of Pillars are
stopped.

[Spike Trial]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
! Blue Chest: Blue Key
~ Spotter x3

Another sneaking section here.
The elemental switches will
toggle the spikes in the floor,
so hit one whenever your
progress is blocked as you make
your way up to the switch that
ends the sneaking section. Grab
the key before you leave.

[Earth/Cloud Room]

Hit the orb with either element
and teleport out.

----------[ Auguste 2F: Boss ]--

Now that you've conquered all
three elemental pairs it's time
for another boss. Head through
the newly unlocked door.

[Prep Room]
! Sun Crystal
! Solar Station

[Boss Room]

Have another chat with Perrault,
then get ready for the next
chimera.

         | Manticore |
         *-----------*

Use the same strategy as with
the Dragon Chimera, but don't
stand next to it unless it's
already in the middle of an
attack. It can grab you with its
hair and damage you repeatedly.
The Cloud/Earth projectiles it
spits can be deflected back at
it with a Quick Guard. Once it
gets below 50% HP it can fire
three projectiles in quick
succession.

Only one way you can go at the

[Partner Trial] ! Mission: Get
on both weighted switches at the
same time!

This puzzle isn't too tough.
Hitting a switch will toggle
platforms up or down, and each
switch can only be used once.
You have to get both characters
to the weight switches at the
end. If you mess up, just call
Alice on the Mobile Unit and
Retry. Use Select to switch
between characters and A to
activate switches.

At first there's only one thing
you can do - have Lucian hit the
switch near him. After doing so,
make your way to the area with
two switches next to each other.
Don't touch them yet. Switch to
Aaron and have him walk across
the newly raised platform to the
next switch, which he should hit
to raise another platform. Cross
that platform, then have Lucian
hit one of his switches to raise
a third platform for Aaron. Have
him cross it, then when he hits
another dead end in the middle
of the room, have Lucian hit the
other switch. Aaron can then
cross over to the other side of
the room and another switch.
Once he hits that switch he can
make it to one of the pressure
pads. Lucian then just has to
head to the top of the room, hit
the final switch, and cross over
to his own pressure pad. With
both pads activated, the
platforms will disappear and two
new ones will appear in the
rooms with Solar Stations.

[Narcissus Prep Room]

Now Lucian is back in Narcissus,
just in time for the boss fight.
Step on the platform to proceed.

         Element:  Dark

The snake tail spits gobs of
poison. You can knock them away
by guarding, but the chimera
won't be affected. It will growl
when it's preparing to charge.
Don't try to guard its charge,
as it'll just knock you over.
It's pretty fast, so you may
want to actually run out of the
way. Don't get too close unless
it's already in the middle of
attacking, or you could be hit
by its poison breath attack.

Don't use Nero, as it's strong
against Dark. There also aren't
any poles here for it to ram
into. You can get a lot of hits
in while it's stunned or using
its poison breath attack, and
you can try to get some in
between its other attacks but
that's more risky.

When its health gets below 50%
it can pounce twice in a row.

         Element:  Sol

It wanders around leaping and
firing Sol Shots most of the
time. Try to stay out of its
direct line of fire and you
should be able to dodge most of
those. Besides, they can't be
deflected back at it.

If you get close to it, it may
rear back and start glowing.
That's your cue that it's going
to bite. If you manage to Quick
Guard the lunge you'll stun it,
so try that if you're daring.
Otherwise, move to the side and
get a combo in. You could just
block and let your guard counter
soak up the hit, but don't just
stand there or it will bite you
and start absorbing your Life.
When its tail grows four spikes
and glows red it's about to
swing in a large circle, so get
your guard up. If it glows red
with a single spike it will stab
out in one direction. If you hit
it right after an attack you
should always be able to get a
full combo in, and maybe another
one while it hunches over
afterwards if you're quick.

         *------------*
         | Duke Dumas |
         *------------*
         Element:  Dark

During the first half he mostly
uses Blood Cutter, which can be
deflected back at him with a
Quick Guard. Kinda makes you
feel like you're in a Zelda
game, huh? Keep your distance.
His close-range spinning attack
Lunar Flare can eat right
through your guard and stun you,
but it's great for healing when
using the Red Cross shield. If
he starts to gather energy in a
colored aura, hit it with the
opposite element or get ready
for a world of pain - Nightmare
can't be blocked, but keep
running and hopefully you can
dodge it. The Blood Company
attack, in which he turns into a
swarm of bats, can be countered
pretty well with Dragoon or Hel
early on, but you may want to
run in circles around the
stage's perimeter once you can
no longer outrun them. He uses
stronger attacks more often as
his HP dwindles and moves
faster, so you might want to
save your Trance for the second
half of the battle. You'll have
to engage in a struggle if you
attack him in Trance mode,
though, and Bursts will only get
one hit in before he escapes in
bat form, so don't rely on it.

          | Polidori |
          *----------*
         Element:  None

Keep your distance. He has
several different attack
patterns. One is to lob Slimes
at you - just parry them back at
him for solid damage. Another is
to send out spikes that follow
you - just keep moving (if
necessary, running) and that
one's not too difficult. If he
slowly homes in on your
position, stay away from the
shadow, as he'll crush you for
massive damage. Not an extremely
difficult fight if you're
careful. He also has the ability
to summon images of the bosses
you've fought so far to perform
their characteristic attacks.
They can't be hurt, so just
dodge.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

You've managed to destroy
Polidori's corporeal body, but
they're called Immortals for a
good reason. At this point
Polidori takes the fight to
space. There are three phases,
and later phases tend to focus
on more complex attacks. The
first attack is a series of
concentric rings. Just keep in
the center of the rings to avoid
taking damage. In the second
attack, Polidori opens his arms
and begins charging lasers in a
clockwise manner. Finally, for
his third attack he summons 3-4
swarms of meteors to throw at
you.

Toasty is probably the most
effective, but it eats through
energy quickly if you're not
careful, so I prefer to use
Ursula for the entire battle.
Fire missiles whenever he's not
attacking and whenever you have
a chance during the concentric
circles. When he opens up to
start charging the lasers, fire
a missile at each one as soon as
it starts charging and it should
stop. When he starts drawing
summoning circles for the meteor
attack you can still damage him
by firing missiles where his eye
is normally located. You can
also get in a couple of shots
between meteor strikes, but keep
moving when they're flying at
you.

After the three forms, Alice
will interrupt and suggest that
you attack his core. For this
"battle" you're limited to Nero,
so just hold your stylus over
him and you'll emerge
victorious.

Congratulations, you beat the
game. After the credits you can
choose a save slot for your
clear data, which you can then
load to start a New Game+. Some
accessories can only be obtained
on Hard Mode, but enemy levels
are increased, so choose your
difficulty accordingly. You can
also choose to reset your stats
and levels. You keep everything
else, though, even your
terrennials and climates. You
won't get back any Warrior's
Ethics you used, though, so
don't reset your levels if you
care about the stat bonuses.

You also now have access to Boss
Rush and new Shooting Battle
stages in Sheridan's mansion.
Other than that, the game will
progress normally, except for
one area...

================================

      EPILOGUE: THE FINAL TRACES

Start a New Game+ using your

both characters (at the
beginning of Chapter 3), a new
dungeon will appear at the top
right of the map.

This tower consists of 100
floors, with enemy levels on
each floor equal to that floor's
number. The tower itself is
divided into 10 segments, each
with 10 floors. At the end of
each segment is a boss battle,
then you are taken to the
treasure room to claim your
reward. There is a different
reward for each segment, one
green chest and one orange
chest:
 1 -  10: Training Boots, METEOR
11 - 20: Sound Data BATTLE 1,
     LUNASTEEL
21 - 30: Cursed Boots, METEORITE
31 - 40: Sound Data BATTLE 2,
     LUNASTEEL
41 -  50: Cursed Scarf, FANG
51 - 60: Sound Data BATTLE 3,
     GENERATOR
61 -  70: Cursed Mask, FANG
71 - 80: Sound Data SHOOTING
     BATTLE, GENERATOR
81 - 90: Eclipse Eye, Endurance
     Fruit
91 - 100: Eclipse Goggles,
     Resurrective

You can't save or use the Mobile
Unit in here, so make whatever
preparations you need in order
to get through 10 floors in a
row. I recommend using the
Frigid Arctic climate, since it
disables flame traps and has low
wind speeds most of the time.

[Entrance] ! Hint Panel: Choose
your Destination

Once you unlock more floors hint
panels will appear that allow
you to change the destination of
the teleporter. For now, step on
the teleporter to be taken to
the first floor.

 '------------------------------

Enemies spawn in when others
have been defeated. Just attack
with Ninja or a charged Hel and
you should plow through them.

 '------------------------------

Keep in one spot and let the
Lizardman enemies come to you to
avoid triggering the Skeleton
Archer spawn. They'll make it
more difficult to avoid getting
hit.

Aaron can take out most of the
enemies from the center platform
by looking around. That way you
don't have to bother with the
Pillars at the far ends.

it's not a Mimic.

Walk onto the connecting
platforms to get the enemies to
spawn, then hang back so you
don't get hit by the cannon.
Alternatively, pick off the
cannon with Witch.

 '------------------------------

If a Ghost manages to steal one
of your items, you can hit one
of the Sol Switches on at the
far corners to darken the room
and reveal them. You can also
use automatic lock-on and it
will find them.

out on each spire to face the
spawning enemies.

 '------------------------------

Watch out for the Orcs that
spawn between flame traps.
Setting the climate to Frigid
Arctic will disable the flame
traps entirely.

 '------------------------------

Spiked balls drop from the
ceiling, cutting off the path
behind you and forcing you to
keep moving. You might want to
equip a Wind Amulet to prevent
fainting from the Evil Eye
attacks. You can also hug the
wall to slip by their shots, or
use the Bomber to take them out
from an adjacent hallway. Note
that you can run right past the
Lizardmen and they'll most
likely end up getting killed by
the spiked balls anyway. It may
not be an issue now, but the
drops speed up on higher floors.

The boss of this section is an
enemy gauntlet. They're all Sol
elemental, so you can tear
through them using Hel and Nero.

These are the ruins that the

you offed him. It's the least
you can do to finish his work,
right?

[Great Cavern]

the room that activates the
moving platform near the top.

[Lava Drift]

takes you to a chest.

[Abandoned Passage]

There's another walkway on the
other side of the room with a
Green Chest, but you can't reach
it from here.

[Blocked Gate] ! Sun Shards x2 !
Skylight x2 ! Elemental Switch:
Flame/Frost x3
- Green Chest:
  · Ice Flame Amulet (first time
  · LEATHER
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Crate x5
~ Cannon x3
~ Chillin' x8
~ Ghoul x11
~ Poison Spider x4

Head down and right to reach
that chest you saw in the
previous room. Back in this room
you'll need to cross a pipe to
continue, but be careful not to
fall off or it's Game Over.

There are some elemental
switches at the bottom that you
need to mess with to continue,
and the only way to reach them
is via floating platforms, which
in turn are targeted by Cannons.
You can go around the back of
the Cannons to a skylight and
fire off a few Witch or Bomber
shots to take care of the
Cannons while you're at it.

Hit the switches with a shot of
the opposite element to change
them. First turn them all to
Flame to spawn a Green Chest,
then all to Frost to open the
door.

[Abandoned Passage]
- Green Chest: THROTTLE
~ Ghoul x1

Only one Ghoul guarding the
chest. Shouldn't be a problem.

[Conveyor Room]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest: LENS
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Jar x2
~ Cannon x2
~ Chillin' x4
~ !Ghoul x15

The switch at the top raises the
gate to a treasure room. Again,
use Witch or bomber to hit the
cannons from the side.

[Dark Room]
! Dark Area
! Sun Shards
! Elemental Switch: Sol/Dark
~ Ghost x4

Hit the switch to make your
journey through the other side
of this room a lot easier. When
you get back to the Conveyor
Room, take either platform (it's
really the same one going back
and forth between the two
docks), then transfer to another
one halfway through. Follow the
path around to the exit, which
takes you to the other half of
the Dark Room.

- Barrel x2
- Crate x2
- Jar x2
~ Chillin' x7
~ Lizardman x3

Be careful of the two Lizardmen
on the pipe. If you don't parry
their attacks properly you could
easily get knocked off. Throw
the switch on the left to
activate a moving platform
shortcut. Take the right exit
before the left one.

[Remote Corridor]
- Green Chest:
  · Gold Nugget
  · Warrior's Ethic (Hard Mode, 

This is just a tiny peninsula.
Grab the chest and head back
around to the room proper.

- Invisible Chest: Restorative (

Don't miss the invisible chest
near the exit.

Step on the lift to proceed into
the icy Sealed Area.

Whenever you step on an icy
floor, you'll continue sliding
until you hit a wall or a normal
floor. Plan ahead accordingly.

There's a switch near the top
that you need to hit to open the
gate to the next area. You won't
be able to approach it, so just
shoot it as you slide by.

You can see a green chest on a
ledge, but you can't reach it
from down here, so just head
through the gate you opened.

shortly.

Keep right and head up the large
staircase to reach a smaller
room.

[Altar of Frost]

Grab your new weapon, then head
back to the Center Room to
explore the only other path.

[West Room]
- Green Chest:
  · Cool Bandanna (first time)
  · Heaven Fruit
~ Orc x1

Finally, it's the chest that you
saw when you first entered this
area. Either make the long trek
back out or use your Mobile Unit
to get a lift from Alice.
