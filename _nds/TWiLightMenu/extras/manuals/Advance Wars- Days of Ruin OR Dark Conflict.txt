   ~1.Basics of Advance Wars~
================================
Advance Wars has been a series
that has been ongoing for
several years, dating back to
the GBA. The general gist of the
game is that several players
control different armies, and
attack eachother on their
respective turns until one army
falls, or the HQ of an army is
captured.

Of course, it isn't all this
simple. Because the game is
structured turn- based style, it
will take a decent amount of
strategy to outwit your opponent
and overpower them. You'll need
to manage your funds as you
purchase new units and repair
weakened ones, and there are
many other variables on the
battlefield you will need to
take into account.

To veterans of the series,
although Days of Ruins takes on
a different look than the
cartoony look of old, the basic
gameplay (with the exception of
several unit changes and
additional units) remains the
same. For someone new to the
series, the first few campaign
missions will act as a tutorial,
so you won't feel lost when you
begin the game.

================================
         ~2.Unit Guide~
================================
There's a whole mess of units in
Days of Ruins. A decent amount
of units, ones that are staples
of the series, remain the same
or mostly unchanged. Some of
them look the same, but with
different names. Others have
been completely changed,
deleted, or added altogether.

For those who haven't played an
Advance Wars game before, all
units have a cost to buy at a
factory, port, or airport. They
also have movement types (which
effect how they move across
terrain), movement amounts (how
many spaces they can move in a
single turn), fuel (if a ground
unit runs out of fuel, it can't
move. If a naval or air unit
runs out if fuel, it sinks/
crashes and is destroyed),
ammunition and weapon types,
visibility (how many spaces
become visible during Fog of
War), and attack range.

Range is slightly different than
what you may expect. If the
range is only 1, then that unit
is a direct combat unit. They
need to move next to their enemy
and can attack on the same turn.
Indirect units generally don't
have ranges of 1 (except for a
certain unit), and cannot move
and attack in the same turn. If
an enemy unit is in their range
of fire, they can shoot to hit
them. Otherwise, all you can do
is have them sit there or move
them elsewhere.

Also included here are their
weaknesses and heavy weakenesses
(as shown ingame, these are the
units that are capable or
ripping through the specified
unit).

-----------------
~2A.Ground Units~
-----------------
~~Infantry~~
Cost--1500G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--Infinite
Mobility--3
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Inftry

Weaknesses--Flare, Recon, Tank,
B Copter, Battleship, Anti-Tank

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber, War
Tank, Anti-Air, Rockets, Md
Tank, Artillery, Seaplane

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Anti-Tank

Infantries are the backbone of
any army. These cheap units
aren't very powerful, nor do
they have the mobility advantage
most vehicles have. However, you
will be needing these to capture
properties. Infantries are one
of only three units that can
capture.

They also make good meatshields
to protect your indirect units
from direct fire. Since they are
so cheap, they are expendable in
that regard. It may seem weird
that these are good against
Anti-Tanks (which is listed as a
weakeness). However, Anti-Tanks
are easily destroyed by
Infantry-type units, as well as
air units, and since the
Infantry is so cheap, it makes
and effective counter for the
Anti-Tank (which also has low
mobility).

Don't expect them to do much, if
any, damage to vehicles. Most
direct land units have machine
guns of their own that can tear
through Infantry, so be careful.

~~Mech~~
Cost--2500G
Fuel--70
Main Weapon--Bazooka
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--3
Mobility--2
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Mech

Weaknesses--Artillery, Seaplane,
Md Tank, Tank, Flare, Battleship

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber, Anti-
Air, War Tank, Rockets

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Tank, Anti-Air,
Recon, Artillery, Recon, Flare,
Anti-Tank

The Mech has been dropped in
price (it was 3000G in the
past), however its power has
been slightly nerfed in return
(about 10% less damage dealt to
all units). However, that can be
ignored as the Mech still
remains a powerful unit. As with
the other Infantry units, it is
capable of capturing properties.
However, due having the lowest
movement range in the game, it
probably isn't wise to use these
to capture them with, unless the
properties are across mountain
ranges (which Mechs can cross
quicker than Infantry).

It also may seem odd that they
are effective against many of
their weaknesses, but the Mech
can tear through all lightly
armored land units. The only
problem with it is that it has
very low ammo--only 3 uses and
the Mech will become as
effective as an Infantry. Keep
Rigs on hand to resupply them.

A swarm of Mechs, as has been
the case in the previous games,
remains somewhat useful. A
tactical player can't be
defeated with a Mech rush, but
the computer occasionally can.
It also works as a last ditch
effort when you are surrounded
by Tanks.

~~Bike~~
Cost--2500G
Fuel--70
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--Infinite
Mobility--5
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Tire B

Weaknesses--Artillery, Seaplane,
Md Tank, Tank, Flare, Battleship

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber, Anti-
Air, War Tank, Rockets

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Anti-Tank

The Bike has roughly the same
power (and weaknesses) as the
basic Infantry. So, for the cost
of a Mech, what are you getting
out of it? Well, for one this
unit can move five spaces,
allowing you to capture further
away properties very quickly and
without the need of a Rig.

Outside of that, however, there
isn't much else Bikes are good
for. They can bash up Anti-Tanks
well since they can sit outside
of their range, then attack on
the turn after. You can also use
Bikes to disrupt the capturing
of your enemies, allowing an
early monetary advantage if you
know what you are doing. Other
then early capturing, you're
better off sticking with the
cheaper Infantry to attack
whatever you intend on having a
Bike attack.

~~Recon~~
Cost--4000G
Fuel--80
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--Infinite
Mobility--8
Vision--5
Range--1
Movement Type--Tire A

Weaknesses--Mech, Tank,
Artillery, Seaplane, B Copter,
Anti-Tank, Battleship

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber, Md Tank, Rockets

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon

The Recon is a cheap unit, but
don't get giddy over that 8
movement. Tire A type vehicles
lose many movement points over
anything that isn't a road, so
don't expect the Recon to reach
its destination quickly. Their
big selling point is their 5
range, which is amazingly useful
in Fog of War. Station several
Recons across the map to keep
tabs on enemy movement.

Attack wise, the Recon can be
bit useful. Provided there's
mainly roads to the properties
the enemy is capturing early on,
several Recons can easily
disrupt them and bring their
economy briefly to a halt. The
Recon isn't good at taking out
anything stronger than Infantry,
so once a non-Fog of War battle
gets settled in, you aren't
likely to be using these
anymore.

~~Flare~~
Cost--5000G
Fuel--60
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--Infinite
Mobility--5
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type-Tank

Weaknesses--Rockets, Tank, Mech,
Seaplane, Artillery, B Copter,
Anti-Tank

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber, Md Tank

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare

This new unit has an interesting
twist to it. Although it can
attack Infantry units (doing
slightly more damage than a
Recon), it is also capable of
firing flares as the name
implies. Firing flares works as
if the Flare is an indirect
unit. You can only fire them if
you don't move on your turn, and
only if there is Fog of War.

When you fire a flare, you need
to choose a spot within a five
space radius of the Flare unit.
The flare itself will be
launched when you choose the
spot, and every space in the
flare's three-square radius will
be lit up for the turn,
including hidden areas such as
ruins and forests. Outside of
Fog of War, the Flare isn't too
useful. It's just an overpriced
Recon for the most part, so only
use it when Fog of War is active
(especially rainy weather).

~~Anti-Air~~
Cost--7000G
Fuel--60
Main Weapon--Cannon
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--6
Vision--3
Range--1
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--Bomber, Rockets,
Tank, Anti-Tank

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank, Md
Tank

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare,
Artillery, Rockets, Anti-Air, B
Copter, T Copter, Bomber,
Duster, Seaplane, Fighter

The Anti-Air is a unit you'll
come to love when the enemy is
trying to bash you with aerial
units. It's 1000G cheaper than
what it used to be, but its
power hasn't really changes at
all. The Anti-Air will
completely annihilate any air
unit the is within its range.
The Bomber is the only unit that
can attack (and severely injure
as well) then Anti-Air, reducing
the damage the Bomber takes in
return.

The Anti-Air isn't useful
against just air units, however.
This weapon will OHKO all
Infantry type units (save
promoted ones standing on high
defense terrain). If Infantry
units are rushing towards you,
pump out several Anti- Airs.
Just be careful of Mechs which
are capable of severely
crippling the Anti-Air.

~~Tank~~
Cost--7000G
Fuel--70
Main Weapon--Tank Gun
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--6
Mobility--6
Vision--3
Range--1
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--War Tank, Seaplane,
Anti-Tank, Md Tank, B Copter,
Rockets

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Artillery, Rockets,
Missiles, Rig

The Tank is the most basic
direct assault unit, and the
cheapest. You'll be seeing
plenty of these--both from your
production and of the enemy. The
Tank is very effective against
most ground units, but don't
expect it to dent Medium and War
Tanks very easily. Several Tanks
together can bring them down,
but don't expect a lone Tank to
do it.

Tanks also make good bait for
enemy units, and due to their
high mobility, can also break
stalemates by inciting your foe
to attack. Regarding how cheap
they are, you should be able to
produce them constantly and
replace any that are lost in a
fight.

~~Medium Tank~~
Cost--12000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Heavy Tk Gun
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--5
Mobility--5
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--War Tank

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, Artillery,
Rockets, Missiles, Rig

For a little extra cash, you can
purchase a stronger version of
the normal Tank. Medium Tanks
trade mobility and ammunition
for higher power and defense.
Although it has been determined
by other than regular Tanks are
more cost effective, Medium
Tanks are still useful.

They can easily kill or severely
wound any unit they are capable
of attacking, except for War
Tanks. Because of their high
defense, you can put them in
chokepoints and hold it for a
decent amount of time. Just be
careful of indirect units--they
can injure Medium Tanks with
ease.

~~War Tank~~
Cost--16000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Mega Gun
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--5
Mobility--4
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--Bomber

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Rockets, Missiles,
Rig

The War Tank is the strongest
land unit, and decimates
anything that gets in its way.
Be sure to have a Rig on hand if
you build one of these monsters
--it can run out of ammunition
rather quickly.

If you're on the receiving end
of a War Tank barreling slowly
down the road, don't worry--it's
pretty simple to kill one of
these things. Rockets are
effective since War Tanks can't
stand outside of their range and
attack the Rocket in the same
turn. Anti-Tanks also rip
through War Tanks, and War Tanks
themselves are also counters.
War Tanks aren't very cost
effective, mainly due to their
low movement. Don't build these
too often-- in all honesty,
regular Tanks are still better
than them.

~~Artillery~~
Cost--6000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Cannon
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--5
Vision--3
Range--2-3
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--Md Tank, Rockets,
Artillery, Tank, Mech, Seaplane,
Battleship

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, Artillery,
Rockets, Missiles, Rig

Artilleries are basic indirect
units. As with most indirect
units, the Artillery cannot move
and attack in the same turn, and
cannot counterattack (let alone
attack directly). If an enemy is
in their range on your turn, you
can fire at them. Otherwise, all
you can do is keep moving them.

Artilleries are great units to
have around, mainly because they
pack a punch while hopefully
staying safe from enemy fire. If
you can keep them shielded, and
lure enemy units into their line
of fire, then the Artillery
becomes an invaluable asset to
an army (not to mention they are
quite cheap for the damage they
inflict).

~~Anti-Tank~~
Cost--11000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Cannon
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--4
Vision--2
Range--1-3
Movement Type--Tire B

Weaknesses--Bomber

Effective Against--Recon, Flare,
Anti-Air, Tank, Md Tank, War
Tank, Artillery, Rockets,
Missiles, Anti-Tank, Rig, T
Copter, B Copter

The Anti-Tank is regarded as one
of the most overpowered units in
the game. This thing rips
through all land units, and is
the only indirect unit that has
a range of 1 AND can
counterattack. Not only that,
but it can also attack B
Copters! What can't this thing
do?

Well, its biggest weakness is
Infantry type units. Infantry,
Mechs, and Bikes are cheap
units, and several of them can
kill an Anti-Tank. Whatever you
do, don't attack this thing with
an land vehicle. The attacker
will deal minimal damage, while
the Anti-Tank will dish out
usually around 5 HP worth of
damage on the counterattack.
Artilleries and Rockets are also
good counters, but moreso with
Rockets since Anti-Tanks can't
counterattack them. Just beware
of their insanely low movement.
Tire B gets movement penalties
on most terrain.

~~Rockets~~
Cost--15000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Rocket
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--5
Mobility--5
Vision--3
Range--2-5
Movement Type--Tire A

Weaknesses--Mech, Tank, Rockets,
Artillery, Seaplane, B Copter,
Battleship

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber, Md Tank

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Anti-Tank, Rockets,
Missiles, Rig

Rockets are one of the most
expensive land units, and for
good reason. One Rockets can
easily break a stalemate. Bring
one of these near some enemy
units stalling for time and
watch them scatter.

Also, Rockets can severaly
damage any land unit in their
massive 3-5 range. Just be
careful, though--even the weak
land units, like Anti-Airs, can
severely damage Rockets. Be sure
to keep them well protected at
all time. 15000G isn't the kind
of money you can just throw away
on a unit that will get killed
quickly. Be careful when using
Rockets. On huge maps they
generally aren't worth it
because of their horrible
movement. 5 movement is fine,
but Tire A gets penalized on
anything that isn't a road. They
can take a long time to reach
their destination.

~~Missiles~~
Cost--12000G
Fuel--50
Main Weapon--Anti-Air Msl
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--5
Mobility--5
Vision--5
Range--3-6
Movement Type--Tire A

Weaknesses--Mech, Tank, Rockets,
Artillery, Battleship, Seaplane,
Anti-Tank

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber, Md Tank

Effective Against--Seaplane, B
Copter, T Copter, Fighter,
Duster, Bomber

Missiles are expensive, but if
an enemy plane is stupid enough
to enter its range, it's as good
as dead. Missiles are quite
expensive, and obviously
worthless on maps with no
airports, but if you manage to
put a Missiles near an enemy
airport, then you have
essentially made that airport
useless for the foe.

Since you'll kill whatever they
build there, you can take your
time and capture it for
yourself. Quite a nice tactic.
Did you also notice that their
range has increased to 3-6? For
the same price, you get a bit
more out of Missiles this time
around.

~~Rig~~
Cost--5000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--None
Material--1
Mobility--6
Vision--1
Range--None
Movement Type--Tank

Weaknesses--Rockets, Tank, Mech,
Seaplane, Artillery, B Copter

Heavy Weaknesses--War Tank,
Bomber, Md Tank

The Rig, despite its name,
functions just like the APC of
old. It can carry one
Infantry/Mech and transport them
quickly across the field, and it
can still resupply units next to
it (which is essential in larger
and longer maps).

But the name truly comes from an
additional feature. It can
create Temporary Airports/Ports.
On any plains you can choose to
construct a Temporary Airport,
and on any beach you can
construct a Temporary Port. A
Rig can only build one temporary
structure, and it works as if
you're capturing it (takes 20
points to finish, based off of
Rig's HP). Temporary
Ports/Airports CANNOT construct
new units. Instead, they can
repair and resupply their
specific units. This is
extremely handy if you can't
have a bunch of Rigs running
about the course.

Be careful, though. Temporary
structures can be captured by
the enemy. Likewise, you can
recapture them and capture any
temporary structures the enemy
makes. Make good use of them. If
you want to build more temporary
structures, you'll need to make
another Rig (or use Greyfield's
CO Power to replenish the
material in the Rig).

----------------
~2B.Naval Units~
----------------
**Note--All naval units burn one
  fuel every day, whether they
  move or not.
If they run out of fuel, they
will sink and be destroyed.**

~~Battleship~~
Cost--25000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Cannon
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--5
Vision--3
Range--3-5
Movement Type--Ship

Weaknesses--Bomber, Submarine

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Anti-Tank, Rockets,
Missiles, Rig, Cruiser,
Unsubmerged Submarines, Carrier,
Battleship, Gunboat, Lander

The Battleship remains the king
of the seas, and is even moreso
now then ever. Despite its range
getting cut by one, the
Battleship is now the only
indirect unit that can move AND
attack in the same turn.

Battleships can attack and
severely injure all land and
naval units (except for
submerged Submarines). They are
quite expensive, and a single
Submarine strike can turn a
Battleship into scrap metal, but
as long as you have Cruiser
support, then a Battleship is
well worth the 25000G investment
you will need to put into it.

~~Carrier~~
Cost--28000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--AA Gun
Material--4
Mobility--5
Vision--4
Range--1
Movement Type--Ship

Weaknesses--Bomber

Heavy Weaknesses--Submarine

Effective Against--B Copter, T
Copter, Duster, Fighter,
Seaplane, Bomber

The Carrier, despite remaining
almost the same price as it was
in Dual Strike, appears to be
useless. 28000G for a weak anti-
air gun when the Cruiser excels
so much more? Pah!

The Carrier's main reason of
existance is because of its
material. Provided that the
Carrier doesn't move, it is
capable of creating a Seaplane
for 15000G. A total of 43000G
for a small, low fuel and ammo
plane? What's the use? Seaplanes
can attack EVERY unit in the
game. Keep them well fueled and
the damage they can cause will
far outpay their original cost.
Because each Seaplane built uses
1 material, you can only build a
maximum of four Seaplanes from
one Carrier. When you produce a
Seaplane, you can launch it on
the next day. You can choose
where to move it, and you can
attack with the Seaplane when
you launch it. This doesn't take
up the Carrier's turn, so you
can move/attack/produce again
that turn.

Carrier's can only hold 2 planes
at once. Boarded planes will be
refueled at the beginning of the
day, and have 2 HP repaired
every day as well, so that also
makes up for the Carrier's lack
of weaponry. Keep them well away
from actual battle--they are
fragile ships.

~~Submarine~~
Cost--20000G
Fuel--70
Main Weapon--Torpedo
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--6
Vision--5
Range--1
Movement Type--Ship

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber,
Cruiser

Effective Against--Gunboat,
Battleship, Submarine, Carrier,
Lander

Submarines are essential in any
navy. When your foe is packing
Carriers and Battleships, you
will be needing to employ
Submarines to take them out
quickly. Submarines are very
powerful, and have huge vision,
making them quite useful for
ocean scouting.

Submarines are also capable of
diving underwater on their turn
(whether they move or not).
Dived Submarines cannot be seen
by enemies underless one of them
moves next to the Submarine on
their turn, or they move a unit
that passes where the Submarine
is located. Dived Submarines
burn five units of fuel at the
start of every day, as opposed
to one unit when unsubmerged
(and like every other naval
unit). Submerged Submarines can
only be hit by other Submarines
and Cruisers. Keep those away,
and Submarines can kill any
other oppositions. Dived
Submarines can rise at any time,
so be sure to raise them when
you need to conserve fuel.

~~Cruiser~~
Cost--16000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Anti-Ship Msl
Sub-Weapon--AA Gun
Ammunition--9
Mobility--6
Vision--5
Range--1
Movement Type--Ship

Effective Against--B Copter, T
Copter, Duster, Fighter,
Seaplane, Bomber, Submarine

The Cruiser is an important
naval unit that you will need to
constantly be producing. These
units have large vision, much
like Submarines, making them
useful in Fog of War. They are
also anti-Submarine, so if your
enemy starts to build
Submarines, a single Cruiser can
easily counter them.

They are also insanely powerful
against air units. If the enemy
is sending air units across the
ocean, block them off with
Cruisers. They are moderately
expensive, but are super
effective against anything they
can hit, except for other ships.
Cruisers can also hold two
copter units.

~~Lander~~
Cost--10000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--None
Mobility--6
Vision--1
Range--0
Movement Type--Trpt

Weaknesses--Seaplane, Submarine,
Battleship, Rockets

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber

Landers are capable of
transporting a maximum of two
land units. Landers need to be
on a beach or Port in order to
load/drop units. Landers are
your only way of transporting
land units (other than Infantry)
across the ocean, so make good
use of them. If they are
destroyed, their cargo is
destroyed as well.

~~Gunboat~~
Cost--6000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Anti-Ship Msl
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--1
Mobility--7
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Trpt

Weaknesses--B Copter, Cruiser,
Gunboat

Heavy Weaknesses--Bomber,
Submarine, Seaplane, Rockets,
Artillery, Battleship

Effective Against--Battleship,
Unsubmerged Submarine, Gunboat,
Cruiser, Lander, Carrier

The Gunboat is a cheap unit, but
don't be swayed by the fact it
only has one ammo. It packs
quite a punch, and easily
cripples most enemy naval units.
Gunboats are also capable of
carrying a single Infantry/Mech,
and with their high movement,
they can reach small islands
with properties fairly quickly.

Keep Temporary Ports, or Rig's,
on beaches nearby so you can
resupply the Gunboat with more
ammunition as the need arises.
Gunboats are cheap and
expendable, and generally deal
an amount of damage roughly
equal to their price.

-----------------
~2C.Aerial Units~
-----------------
**Note--All air units burn fuel
  each day, whether they move or
  not. If
they run out of fuel, the will
crash and be destroyed. Fuel
burned each day is different for
each type of aircraft.**

~~Fighter~~
Cost--20000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Anti-Air Msl
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--9
Vision--5
Range--1
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--5

Weaknesses--Anti-Air

Heavy Weaknesses--Cruiser,
Missiles

Effective Against--B Copter, T
Copter, Bomber, Fighter, Duster

Fighters are second to none in
what they are best at--
annihilating all aerial units.
They are nowhere near as
expensive as they really seem,
mainly because one Fighter
should be able to destroy at
least 40000G in enemy air units
before taking too much damage to
continue. There's not much else
to say about Fighters. Besides
boasting the largest movement
range in the game, you should
only use them if you need to
counter enemy air units when
simple Anti-Airs aren't able to
easily reach their targets.

~~Bomber~~
Cost--20000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Bomb
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--6
Mobility--7
Vision--3
Range--1
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--5

Weaknesses--Anti-Air

Heavy Weaknesses--Cruiser,
Missiles

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Flare, Anti-
Air, Tank, Md Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Rockets, Missiles,
Rig, Battleship, Unsubmerged
Submarine, Gunboat, Carrier,
Lander

Bombers are one of the most
useful aerial units, capable of
devistating large armies,
causing them to scatter and
retreat for repairs. Anti-Airs
and Missiles are the only things
they need to worry about, but if
Bombers get the first strike on
these units, then they will be
made virtually worthless.

~~Duster~~
Cost--13000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Machine Gun
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--9
Mobility--8
Vision--4
Range--1
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--5

Weaknesses--Fighter, Anti-Air

Heavy Weaknesses--Cruiser,
Missiles

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, B Copter, T Copter,
Bomber, Duster

Dusters are only slightly weaker
than Fighters, and they come at
a cheaper price. That, and they
can attack ground units.
Infantry type units are the only
ground units they will do decent
damage against, though, but they
are at least very effective
against air units. Dusters also
make good scout units in Fog of
War, thanks to high vision and
range.

~~B Copter~~
Cost--9000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--Air-Gnd Msl
Sub-Weapon--Machine Gun
Ammunition--6
Mobility--6
Vision--2
Range--1
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--2

Weaknesses--Seaplane, Duster

Heavy Weaknesses--Missiles,
Fighter, Cruiser, Anti-Air

Effective Against--Infantry,
Mech, Bike, B Copter, T Copter,
Tank, Artillery, Rockets,
Missiles, Rig

B Copters are cheap helicopters
that can attack all land units.
Just be careful--most land units
can attack B Copters, although
they won't do too much damage to
them. B Copters are cheap and
effective, and if you keep them
away from Anti-Airs, then you'll
be just fine.

~~T Copter~~
Cost--5000G
Fuel--99
Main Weapon--None
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--None
Mobility--6
Vision--1
Range--None
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--2

Weaknesses--B Copter

Heavy Weaknesses--Anti-Air,
Missiles, Seaplane, Cruiser,
Fighter, Duster

T Copters are cheap units that
are capable of holding one
Infantry/Mech. These are useful
at transporting them quickly
across the battlefield when a
Rig or Gunboat isn't as
efficient (or possible to use).
Make good use of them early in
the battle to have them reach
distance properties.

~~Seaplane~~
Cost--15000G (+ 28000G)
Fuel--40
Main Weapon--Missiles
Sub-Weapon--None
Ammunition--3
Mobility--7
Vision--4
Range--1
Movement Type--Air
Fuel burned per day--5

Weaknesses--Anti-Air

Heavy Weaknesses--Cruiser,
Missiles

Effective Against--ALL Units

Seaplanes are technically only
15000G, but it requires a 28000G
Carrier to actually produce
these things. The Seaplane has
very low fuel and ammo, so you
will need to keep a Rig,
Carrier, or Temporary Airport
nearby or these things will be
going down pretty quickly. The
plus side is that they can
attack every single unit in the
game, and they will do heavy
damage to them as well (Anti-
Airs and Cruisers included!). If
you have several of these flying
around, with Fighter support,
you can have complete aerial
domination.

-------------------
~2D.Movement Costs~
-------------------
All units have a movement type,
whether it's being in the air,
the sea, or a certain type of
tire for a vehicle. Most terrain
will allow you to pass
unhindered, while others will
take up more movement points on
certain terrain types. Here's a
chart compiling all the types of
terrain and the movement costs
for them: Note-Temporary Ports
and Airports have same movement
costs as their non- temporary
versions.

~2E.Terrain Effects~
--------------------
Now that you know how the
terrain effects movement,
there's then the matter of how
it effects units directly--
defense wise and other overall
effects it can cause. Each Star
used in the description of the
terrain adds 5% to the units'
defense while they are parked on
such terrain. Aerial units
cannot benefit from defense
boosts on terrain.

If a unit is parked on a
structure owned by the player,
and that property benefits that
unit, then that unit will be
supplied and repaired for 2 HP
at the beginning of the turn.
Each HP or repair costs 1/10th
of the unit's price, and is NOT
optional. If a unit is on a
owned building, funds will be
spent repairing it. Factories,
Cities, and the HQ
repair/resupply ground units,
Ports and Temporary Ports for
naval units, and Airport and
Temporary Airports for aerial
units.

~~HQ~~ Defense--**** A structure
that gives units high defensive
boosts, if it is captured then
that team will lose the battle
instantly.

~~City~~ Defense--** Cities
provide moderate defense while
repairing ground troops.

~~Factory~~ Defense--***
Factories can produce new units,
and repair ground troops that
are parked on them.

~~Port~~ Defense--*** Ports can
produce new units, and repair
naval troops that are parked on
them.

~~Airport~~ Defense--***
Airports can produce new units,
and repair aerial units that are
parked on them.

~~Com Tower~~ Defense--*** Com
Towers raise the defense and
attack power all your units by
5% for each Com Tower in your
possession. These also now give
you funds each day.

~~Radar~~ Defense--*** Radar
stations, once captured, reveal
all spaces in Fog of War within
a five space radius of the
station. Covered places like
Woods and Reefs are not revealed
unless they are adjacent to the
tower. These provide you with
funds as well.

~~Silo~~ Defense--** If an
Infantry, Mech, or Bike moves to
an unused silo, they can fire a
single missiles at any space in
the map. All units in the three
space radius blast will lose 3
HP.

~~Roads~~ Defense--None Roads
allow quick movement of all
ground troops, but offer no
defense.

~~Plains~~ Defense--* Plains are
common, offer a small defense
boost, and hardly affect any
unit movement.

~~Mountains~~ Defense--****
Mountains hinder Infantry
movement, but offer high defense
while atop them. During Fog of
War, they add three vision to
the Infantry or Mech while ontop
of them.

~~Woods~~ Defense--*** Woods
hinder movement for most land
units. They offer good defense,
and during Fog of War, enemy
units cannot see units sitting
in woods unless they pass
them/wait next to the woods on
their turn, or a Flare reveals
the location of the unit.

~~Bridges~~ Defense--None
Bridges can be traveled under by
sea units, and can be chokepoint
blocked by them as well. They
offer no defensive boosts.

~~Rivers~~ Defense--None The
only ground units that can cross
rivers are Mechs and Infantry.
They slow the movement of
Infantry.

~~Beaches~~ Defense--None
Beaches are found near the sea's
edges, and are used as locations
where Landers and Gunboats can
load up units. They offer no
other defense.

~~Ruins~~ Defense--* Acts like
Woods in Fog of War, but doesn't
hinder movement of most units.

~~Wasteland~~ Defense--None
Impairs movement of most ground
units.

~~Sea~~ Defense--None Easy
passage for all naval units.

~~Rough Sea~~ Defense--** Slows
passage of most naval units.

~~Reef~~ Defense--** Acts like
water-based Woods during Fog of
War. Impedes movement of naval
units.

~~Mist~~ Defense--* Acts like
Woods in Fog of War. Doesn't
affect movement.

~~Sky~~ Defense--None Only air
units can travel over this
terrain.

~~Fire~~ Defense--None Lights up
a five square radius in Fog of
War. No unit can pass over it.

~~Meteors~~ Defense--None (Have
99 HP, one point lost for each %
point of attack) Meteors cannot
be passed by any unit, but can
be destroyed in two or three
attacks by most units. Once
destroyed, the Plains it was on
can be traversed, and any plasma
that was touching it will
disappear.

~~Plasma~~ Defense--None Cannot
be moved over by any unit. Can
only disappear if a meteor the
plasma is touching is destroyed.

-----------------
~2F.Damage Guide~
-----------------
And finally, there is the damage
units will give to other units.
The numbers here are percentages
when the left side unit attacks
the unit listed on the top row.
These percentages are based on
both units being on a Road
(which has no defense), and
neither are affected by CO
Zones/Powers/ other abilities
that would raise defense.

During each attack, anywhere
from 0% to 10% extra damage
might be added to the damage
dealt out. It's a random factor
and cannot be controlled. As you
could probably guess, if you
would do 60% damage to an enemy
when you have full HP, you will
basically be dealing 6 HP of
damage. Your attack power goes
down 10% for each HP lost. So if
you had 7 HP (using the same 60%
damage from before), you would
be down to dealing 42% damage
(10% of 60 is 6, so you're
losing 6% of attack power with
each HP lost in this scenario).

T Copters and Landers aren't
listed as attackers here,
naturally, because they are
incapable of attacking.

--------------------
~2G.Weather Effects~
--------------------
As you might expect, there are
several different types of
weather effects that can happen
across the battlefield.

The first technically isn't a
weather effect. Fog of War
blankets the battlefield in
blacked dust. You can't see any
enemy units in the blackness
unless that square is in at
least one of your units' vision
range. Ruins, Forests, Reefs,
and Mist hide units during Fog
of War. Enemy units can't see
units hiding in these terrains
unless one of their units passes
the tile their hiding in on
their turn, tries moving
onto/through that tile (and
fails because there's a unit
hiding there), or uses a Flare
to light up the tile.

Rainy weather turns the
battlefield into Fog of War if
it isn't already, but all units
have their vision lowered to
one.

Snowy weather will reduce the
movement of all units by one.
Sandstorms will reduce the
attack power of all units by
30%.

If Penny is your CO, then
regardless if she is boarded on
a unit or not, ALL of her units
aren't affected by the weather.
She is still subject to Fog of
War (technically it isn't a
weathe effect), but snow,
sandstorms, and rain won't
affect her units at all.

--------------
~2H.Promotion~
--------------
New to Advance Wars is promoting
units. Whenever a unit gets a
kill, they will increase in
level. There are three levels--
I, II, and Veteran.

Level I grants the unit a 5%
attack power boost. Level II
gets a 10% attack boost. Veteran
units get a 20% attack and
defensive boost.

If two units join eachother, the
rank of the unit will be the
highest rank of the units that
joined. So, if a Veteran and
level I Tank join, the new Tank
will be a Veteran.

When a CO boards a unit, that
unit is instantly made a
Veteran. Units cannot demote in
level.

---------------------
~2I.Campaign Scoring~
---------------------
Now that you know how to use
units effectively, you can
figure out what you need to do
to get the best scores possible
in campaign mode. You are scored
in the same three catagories as
usual--Speed, Power, and
Technique. However, the last two
have had their requirements
changed a bit. Also, each score
can recieve a maximum of 150
points, so your total can reach
450. Yet, this is impossible to
reach on most maps.

Speed remains the same--it's how
fast you complete the map. There
is a certain time limit to earn
150 points, and a certain one
for 100 points. After you pass
the 100 point time limit, the
Speed score slowly drops down to
zero (finishing between these
two time limits will result in a
score between 150 and 100).

Power has changed. Normally it
was destroying 10% of the enemy
army on one turn, but now it's
based on a certain ratio. It
involves the total percentage of
damage dealt (as seen ingame),
the amount of times you launched
an attack (including
counterattacks), and the amount
of kills you earned. More damage
and kills, while having few
attacks, is key to earning as
many points as possible in
Power.

Technique has also changed.
Normally it was losing less than
20% or your units, but now it's
drastically different. It is
also a ratio of how many units
you used in comparison to how
many units the enemy used. It
has been roughly determined that
in order to get 150 points, you
need to have used about 65% as
many units as your enemy. So if
they used 10 units, using 6 (all
formulas in the game round down)
or less would result in 150
points. Units lost also effect
technique, so play agressive,
but also careful.

You also get various ranks for
how many total points you get: S
Rank--300+ A Rank--250-299 B
Rank--200-249 C Rank--199-

================================
         ~3.CO Center~
================================
As usual, there are a variety of
CO's (Commanding Officers) you
can choose from. Each of them
have their own innate abilities
which affect the battlefield,
and most of them have CO Powers
which can help change the tide
of war.

CO Powers work differently now,
however, and most of the CO's
aren't broken as was the case in
previous games.

--------------------------------
~3A.Commanding Officer
Descriptions~
--------------------------------
There's a variety of CO's, and
most of them have their own
individual CO Power. They all
have a CO Zone, and the effects
of their zone is also noted
here. Any special abilities they
have will be mentioned.

her from being one of the better
CO's, with a CO Power and Zone
that are highly beneficial.

"I can't remember anything..."

CO Zone--2 CO Zone Boosts--10%
defense and 10% attack boosts
for all units

defense and 10% attack power
boosts for all units

CO Power--Has no CO Power or CO
Meter

==========
~~Waylon~~

Waylon, who acts like a smug
jerk constantly, is somewhat
similar to Tasha in that he has
aerial domination.

"It's time for Waylon to do some
wailin'!"

CO Zone--2 CO Zone Boosts--30%
defense and 20% attack boots for
aerial units

CO Power--Wingman:Boosts defense
for all air units

=============
~~Greyfield~~
=============

The youngest daughter of
Caulder, her mind has been
shattered by his vile
experiments. Penny is best used
on maps where weather can be a
serious hazard.

"Tee hee! Let's go, Mr. Bear!"

CO Zone--3 CO Zone Boosts--All
units are uneffected by weather
(this occurs for all units, and
they don't need to be in the CO
Zone for this effect to take
place). Units in the CO Zone
recieve the base 10% defense and
10% attack power that every
other CO Zone gives, but no
additional boosts are given

CO Power--Stormfront:Changes the
weather to a random effect for
three days

===========
~~Tabitha~~
===========
-->Unlocked by clearing C25

The oldest daughter of Caulder,
she is as strict and vindictive
as he is. Tabitha is one of the
most powerful CO's in the game,
and may remind you of a former,
dead CO from a previous game.

"Stupid weak people!"

CO Zone--0 CO Zone Boosts--50%
defense and 50% attack boosts
for all units

CO Power--Firestorm:Drops a
missile that inflicts 8 HP of
damage on all units in a 3 space
radius. It targets the spot
where it can inflict the most HP
worth of damage, making
Tabitha's units' HP worth
negative HP in the calculation

===========
~~Caulder~~
===========
-->Unlocked by clearing C26

Caulder is a man who prides
himself in his insane
experiments. Despite having no
CO Power, his CO Zone has crazy
abilities.

"Fascinating..."

CO Zone--3 CO Zone Boosts--50%
defense and 50% attack bonus for
all units, all units within zone
are healed 5 HP (this still
costs funds)

CO Power-Has no CO Power or
Meter

-------------
~3B.CO Zones~
-------------
Units will not get their CO's
effect unless the CO is on the
battlefield, and even then, the
only units that will get the
boost are those in their CO
Zones (unless a CO Power is
activated, in which case all
units that are specified in
their profile get the boost as
well).

Firstly, you need to have your
CO board a unit. In order for
this to happen, you must put any
unit you want them to board onto
your HQ or an owned property
that produces that unit (Tanks
on a Factory, Bombers on an
Airport, and so on). On your
next turn, instead of moving the
unit, act as if you are going to
choose to Wait. Below that
option will be "CO", provided
you meet a second requirement.
To have a CO board a unit, you
need to pay half of that units'
cost. So boarding a Tank would
cost 3500G.

Once a CO is on a unit, that
unit will have a medal icon and
be promoted to Veteran status.
Part of the battlefield will
turn black around the CO unit.
That is the CO Zone. Any unit in
that zone, including the CO
themself, will benefit from the
CO's attack and defense boost
(provided that the unit fits
with the criteria in their
profile. If your using Will, for
instance, then aerial and naval
units aren't getting a boost).

All units in the CO Zone,
including the CO unit, get a
base 10% attack and defense
bonus (even if they don't match
the unit types the regular
bonuses apply for), and then
additional bonuses the CO gives
them if they match the types in
their profile.

For instance, say Isabella is in
a Tank. She puts a Recon in her
CO Zone. Isabella's Tank is now
140/140 (That's attack/defense).
She gets 20% attack and defense
bonus for being a veteran, 10%
attack and defense base bonus
just for being in the CO Zone,
and another 10% attack and
defense because that's the bonus
Isabella's CO Zone gives to any
unit in her CO Zone. The Recon
is at 120/120, 10% attack and
defense for the base bonus in
the CO Zone, and 10% attack and
defense because Isabella's CO
Zone naturally gives that.

Use CO Zone's to your advantage.
Keep your CO unit well protected
--just because they naturally
have high defense doesn't make
them invincible. Even Tabitha,
who is in a 180/180 unit thanks
to how her CO Zone works, can be
taken down by several units.

------------------------
~3C.CO Meter and Powers~
------------------------
With the exception of Forsythe
and Caulder, all CO's have a two
bar meter under their picture on
the top screen. This is their CO
Meter, but unlike in previous
Advance Wars games, this meter
will not fill up based roughly
on monetary damage dealt and
recieved.

To fill the meter now, you need
to first have your CO board a
unit. Once you've done that, you
can start filling the CO Meter.
Any unit inside the CO Zone,
including the CO unit itself,
can fill the meter by attacking
other units. For every 5 HP of
damage you deal when inside the
CO Zone (regardless of the unit
you're attacking), one yellow
bar will fill up.

When the first half of the meter
is filled, the CO Zone will
increase in radius by one space.
If you keep attacking units, you
can fill up the second half of
the meter. When this happens,
the CO Zone will increase in
radius another space, but you
are also capable of using your
CO Power.

To use your CO Power, select
your CO unit (this is only
possible if you haven't given it
a command yet), and instead of
choosing Wait, choose CO Power.
This will take up the CO units'
turn, but all other units that
haven't moved yet can feel the
power of the CO Power.

There is a downside, however.
This completely drains the CO
Meter, so you will be back to
the basic sized CO Zone. Also of
note is that if the CO unit is
ever destroyed, the CO Meter
completely empties. Be careful
of your CO unit--they are
essentially huge targets for the
enemy to try and kill.

================================
       ~4.Campaign Mode~
================================
One of the main modes of the
game is Campaign Mode. You will
take command of an army after a
disastrous meteor strike on the
planet, killing anyone who tries
disrupting the peace.

Unlike other Advance Wars, you
can go back and do missions you
have already finished. Also,
along the way you will unlock
Trial Maps, which are somewhat
similar to maps and situations
that could be found in the War
Room of the previous games.

------------------
~4A.Campaign Maps~
------------------
Once you start Campaign Mode you
will go through a short cutscene
before being brought to the map
screen. The only mission you can
choose at the start is C1, so
let's get rolling. Noted here is
a time limit. If you finish on
or before the time limit, you
will earn 150 Speed points. Any
longer and the Speed score will
steadily drop.

===================
~~C1-Days of Ruin~~
===================
Time Limit--2 Days
CO--Will/Brenner
Enemy CO--The Beast
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--Bike Enemy Units
--Recon, Bike, Infantry

In this introductory mission you
will learn basic units and how
to move and attack with them.
Obviously, if you're a veteran
then this mission will be
laughable easy. If you're new,
then you'll still find it just
as easily.

Select the Bike and move it
where Will directs it--two
spaces west. On the second day,
Brenner and Lin will appear,
bringing along a Tank and Recon.
Will's Bike will retreat, and
Brenner will be the CO for the
rest of the battle.

Get used to actual combat now.
First have your Recon attack the
enemy Recon, then have your Tank
finish it off. Repeat this
process for the rest of The
Beast's units. Have your Recon
weaken them, then let your Tank
get the kill. Once you finish
off all of his units, the
missions ends. The Beast's units
rarely attack you, instead
preferring to go around your
units. The Bike will generally
try to attack your Recon or
Tank, but it'll do piddle
damage.

S Rank Notes--It's fairly easy
to obtain an S Rank here. Just
weaken everything with your
Recon and finish them with your
Tank. Finishing fairly fast, an
S Rank is almost assured here.

====================
~~C2-A Single Life~~
====================
Time Limit--2 Days
CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--The Beast
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--Tank, Artillery,
Infantry Enemy Units--Infantry,
Bike, 2 Recons, Tank

The Beast's main units are
somewhat damaged, so that should
make things a bit easier for
your Tank. The problem is that
your Tank is out of ammunition.
If a unit is out of ammo, then
it will have to attack units
with its secondary weapon (in
this case, the machine gun). If
it has no other weapon, then
that unit flat out can't attack,

Luckily, your given an Artillery
unit. Time to get used to
indirect combat units if you've
never used them before. Indirect
units, like Artillery, can only
attack units within its range.
In this case, it's a 2-3 space
range. Also, with the exception
of the Battleship, all indirect
units can only fire if they
don't move on their turn.

As Lin suggests, move your Tank
to the chokepoint and attack the
enemy Infantry. Move your
Artillery behind the Tank. Don't
kill the Infantry with your
Infantry--the enemy Recons can
still hurt it even on the
mountains. Move it up onto the
forest north. The enemy Infantry
will likely attack it and do
minimal damage, and the enemy
Infantry should die or be left
with little HP on the
counterattack.

On the second day, you'll be
alerted of the presence of
someone in the ruins surrounded
by mountains to the east. You
don't have to move your Infantry
to that spot, but you should do
it to understand the story. In
any case, have your Artillery
bash any unit entering its range
(focus on destroying the Tank
more than the Recons), then have
your Tank mop up anything the
Artillery can't kill in one
shot.

S Rank Notes--Another fairly
easy S Rank. To keep your
Technique score up, don't let
any of your Infantry get killed.
Thusly, don't try to get the
cutscene where you rescue
Isabella. Have your Artillery
work with your Tank to finish as
quickly as possible.

================
~~C3-Freehaven~~
================
Time Limit--2 Days
CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--The Beast
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--2 Mechs,
Artillery, 2 Tanks Enemy Units--
2 Infantry, 2 Bikes, 3 Recons,
Artillery, Tank

This mission will test your
basic skills that you have
learned over the previous two
missions. First have your Tank
move north and have each one
attack one of the Infantry. Then
have each of your Mechs finish
off the Infantries. Move your
Artillery north and into a small
hole in the mountain range
that'll keep it safe.

The enemy Recon should be in the
Artillery's range next turn, so
attack it and finish it off with
a Tank. Have the remaining Tank
block the chokepoint north so
that your Artillery can hit
whoever attacks your Tank (and
usually it will be The Beast's
Tank).

From this point, hold the
chokepoint, and have your Mechs
attack anything they can.
Remember that they can move
across the mountains, giving
them decent versatility in
reaching The Beast's blocked off
army. His Recons will rarely
attack your Tanks, no matter how
weakened they may be. Once his
Tank is destroyed, focus on
getting rid of the Artillery. If
The Beast places it in a good
position, the chokepoint
strategy will work against you
as he can start to bash your
units back.

Once you destroy the Recons and
Tank, you can easily break
through and finish off his Bikes
and Artillery if you were unable
to get your Mechs over to it and
kill it.

S Rank Notes--It's impossible to
finish this in two days, but
that won't stop you from
finishing this rather quickly.
Rush for the quickpoint, hold it
with your Tank, and have your
Mechs move over the mountains
and assist in destroying all of
the units. Retreat your Mechs
when damaged so you don't harm
your Technique score.

================
~~C4-Moving On~~
================
Time Limit--1 Day
CO--Lin
Enemy CO--The Beast
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Flare, Artillery, Recon,
Tank Enemy Units--Infantry, 2
Bikes, 2 Recons

This mission has Fog of War, so
this will be some training for
that. All units have a certain
vision range, which you can view
on the top screen. This is how
radius of spaces of fog will be
cleared around that unit in Fog
of War. Spaces that are hiding
places (Ruins, Woods, Reefs, and
Mist) can't be seen unless you
move next to them or pass them
when moving.

If you try moving to a space and
you unknowingly try passing
through a space where an enemy
is, that unit will be stopped
instantly and cannot perform any
other actions that turn. You are
given possession of a new unit--
Flares. They are effective
against Infantry type units and
lightly armored vehicles, but
they truly shine in Fog of War.
If they don't move on their
turn, they can fire a flare. The
flare will light up a three
space radius of the space you
choose to fire it at, and all
hiding places are also lit up.
They are only lit up for the
turn you fire it, though.

Try it out now. Launch a flare
up north to reveal several units
hiding in the forests. No matter
where you move the Infantry up
north, it's quite likely to be
killed next turn. Also of note
is that Recons have high vision,
making them useful for Fog of
War. Mechs and Infantry can
stand on mountains to get an
additional three space radius
added to their vision. use these
tips on the following turns to
scout out the enemy troops.

All you need to do is move all
of your troops up north rather
quickly. Be sure to kill the
bike in the woods near where
your units start. Try to keep
your units hidden in woods as
often as possible--if the
original Advance Wars is the one
you've played, you'll be happy
to know the AI follows the rules
of Fog of War as well. Use that
to your advantage and try to
make it so they fall into your
traps. This mission is
impossible to finish in one day,
so don't bother trying to do so.

S Rank Notes--This mission can
be a little annoying to S Rank.
You really need to rush it to
get a high Speed score to
counterbalance the lower Power
score that is likely to result.
Keeping the Infantry to north
alive isn't too hard if you rush
the north with all of your units
on the first day. Kill every
unit in two shots to keep your
Power score up high.

=================
~~C5-New Allies~~
=================
Time Limit--6 Days CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--The Beast Terms--Rout
enemy or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Recon, Artillery, Tank
Enemy Units--Infantry, Mech, 2
Bikes, Recon, 3 Tanks, 2
Artillery

In this mission you will learn
how to capture cities,
factories, and how to produce
new units. Simple stuff. Have
your Mech begin capturing the
factory, and the Bike and
Infantry should start capturing
the nearby cities. All
properties have 20 capture
points, and you capture part of
that depending on the HP of the
unit doing the capturing.
Capturing takes a minimum of two
turns (Only 10 HP units can
finish capturing in two days). A
5 HP unit, for instance, would
take four days to finish a
capture.

The Beast will not move his two
Artilleries, and the Tank
sitting on his HQ won't move
until you come near it. The
other two Tanks and Recon will
move towards you, while all his
Infantry type units will try to
capture any building you don't
capture.

Finish capturing on the second
turn. In case you didn't know,
all properties give you 1000G in
funds at the start of each day.
Your Mech should finish
capturing the factory. Once you
move the Mech off of it next
turn, you can start producing
units there. On The Beast's
turn, he should start attacking
your troops with his Recon, Tank
close behind. You should have
moved your Tank and Recon east,
keeping your Artillery safe from
enemy fire. Use the Artillery to
hurt the Recon and finish it off
with your Recon.

On the third day you can move
the Mech off the factory. This
will allow you to produce new
units. Producing units costs
funds, and at the moment your
choices are rather limited. The
strongest weapons you can make
are Tanks and Artilleries. From
here on, build two or three more
Tanks. Move your Tank army up
north and destroy all the enemy
Tanks, then kill the Infantry.
Move them all outside of The
Beast's Artillery range, then
rush in and kill/injure both of
them. Once you destroy all of
his units, the mission ends.
Alternatively, you can capture
his HQ to end the battle
instantly.

S Rank Notes--This is another
easy S Rank. The Speed
requirement is a bit lenient,
and you should only need to
build two or three Tanks in
order to overwhelm his remaining
forces. Rush for his Artillery
with two strong Tanks, and
you'll be able to win handily in
7 or 8 days.

======================
~~C6-Fear Experiment~~
======================
Time Limit--7 Days
CO--Will
Enemy CO--Penny
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, Recon, 2 Tanks,
Artillery Enemy Units--2
Infantry, 2 Mechs, Bike, 2
Recons, 2 Tanks (Reinforcements
of 2 Md Tanks and War Tank)

First off you want to begin
capturing properties. You want
to capture the facotry up north
as quickly as possible, then go
for any other cities nearby.
Send your Recon and Tanks down
south--it's where Penny will
send the majority of her units.
Don't worry much about her
capturing some cities--she has
no factories with which to
produce more units.

Once the factory is under
control, start getting some
Tanks. You should only need one
or two to finish off the
remaining units. Try to keep
your Artillery alive as long as
possible, and retreat it to an
owned city to get it repaired if
necessary. Try to conserve money
for later if possible. If you
don't need additional Tanks,
Mechs will suffice. Try to rout
the enemy as quickly as
possible.

Once you rout Penny's units, she
will send in several
reinforcements. They are two Md
Tanks and a War Tank. These
tower over your puny Tanks, and
have such high attack and
defense that you don't even have
a chance.

Fortunately, the day after the
reinforcements arrive you will
be alerted you can now build
Anti-Tanks for 11000G. These
units have insane defense, and
rip through any land vehicle.
Not even War Tanks can stand
against them. Retreat all of
your units back to your factory
and start building Anti-Tanks.
You'll probably only get to
build two of them before the Md
Tanks reach you.

Anti-Tanks have a range of 1-3,
and can counterattack. It's
unlikely to be destroyed in
several attacks. Use your
regular Tanks and Mechs to
damage the enemy tanks further
after the Anti-Tanks injure
them. It shouldn't be too hard
to finish the three mammoths
off.

S Rank Notes--An S Rank here can
be moderately hard because of
how low your Power score is
likely to dip. You won't be able
to OHKO most of Penny's units,
so the score will suffer.
Finishing in 7 days isn't
likely, but getting at least 100
points in Speed is fairly simple
(you have about 13 days to do
so). Making only 2 Anti-Tanks
and no other units before that
is best to keeping Technique as
high as possible.

=====================
~~C7-A Kind of Home~~
=====================
Time Limit--4 Days CO--Brenner
Partner CO--Waylon Enemy CO--
Tasha Terms--Rout enemy or
capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Recon, 2 Anti-Airs, Tank,
Artillery, B Copter, 2 Missiles
Enemy Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Tank, Rockets, 3 Dusters,
3 Bombers, 2 Fighters

Tasha has a bunch of aerial
units, which is to be expected
since it's her area of
expertise. Waylon's Fighter will
never move, which is for the
better because you fail the
mission if it gets killed. First
off, use your Missiles to
destroy the Bomber and have the
Anti-Air attack the Duster. Your
primary concern is to destroy
Tasha's aerial forces. Without
those, her ground troops can
easily be cleaned up.

The only threatening ground
forces she has is a lone Tank
and a slow moving Rocket. Lure
the Tank out with your Recon,
then have your B Copter and Tank
kill it. Try to lure Tasha's
Bombers out into Missile range
with some weak units (Infantry,
Tanks, and even Anti-Airs
themselves will be fine). With
the Bombers out of the way, the
mission should be smooth
sailing.

You'll want to build three or
four additional Anti-Airs to aid
you. Try to trap the Fighter in
a corner of the map because they
will keep trying to run away
from you. With their high
movement, they can often succeed
in doing so. If you can keep
either of the Missiles alive,
you can help them aid you in
destroying the pesky Fighters.
The Dusters are easier because,
since they can attack land
units, they often will come into
your line of fire. If you can
finish this mission relatively
fast (8 or 9 days), then an S
Rank can be achieved with little
trouble.

S Rank Notes--Another fairly
simple mission given that the
enemy has easy to kill units.
Build several Anti-Airs (2 or 3
will do), then rush Tasha's
aerial units. You may lose an
Anti-Air to her Bombers, but if
you move some Missiles behind
them, you can destroy the
Bombers when they attack. Have a
Tank kill the Rockets so your
Anti-Airs aren't injured
further.

Tank, Artillery, Missiles

This is yet another Fog of War
map, but this time, The Beast is
able to capture a factory, so
you'll have to contend with him
producing units as well.
Luckily, he has few available
cities if you're smart about
where you attack on the first
turn, so he's unable to produce
much more than a Mech each turn.

Have your Infantry board the T
Copters and drop them off north
near the two factories. Have the
B Copter attack the Infantry
near the southern factory.
There's a second Infantry hiding
in the woods closest to the
fire. Focus on capturing the
factories before getting the
cities. As for the Mech and
Bikes on the mainland, have them
capture cities. You need funds,
quickly.

Once you've got an income, make
an Artillery and a Tank on the
southern bases. You'll need to
push yourself across the bridge.
Use the Recon to scout ahead,
blockade with your Tank and have
the Artillery do all the heavy
firing. Build additional Tanks
as you see necessary. When you
get across the bridge, destroy
any of The Beast's Infantry so
you can sever his economy.

Take Infantry in the T Copters
in the north and capture the
northeastern cities. The Beast
will try getting these, and
stopping him is vital to
succeeding in the mission. In
the south, destroy is Artillery
as quickly as possible, and his
Missiles so you can have your
copters fly around without much
hazard.

Once you invade his base with
several Tanks from the north and
south, the battle will pretty
much be over. Destroy vehicles
first, park a unit over his
factory so he can't build
anything, and mop up the remains
of his army.

S Rank Notes--Beating this while
not creating too many unit is
important. Thusly, you will need
to finish this rather fast so
The Beast can't build too many
units, prolonging the mission
even further. Also, you won't
need as many Tanks to finish him
off. Get a T Copter onto his
factory, then use Tanks and an
Artillery to finish everything
else off. Just beware of his
Missiles.

them to good use on that tiny
island of his. All of those B
Copters are the only difficult
to deal with units. Once you
dispose of them, his Anti-Air,
and Missiles, this mission will
be a breeze. You'll be
introduced to the concept of
temporary structures. Order your
Rig to contruct one on a Plains
tile.

Have your air units bombard The
Beasts' ones. Aim for his B
Copters first with your
Fighters, and avoid the range of
the Missiles and Anti-Air with
your Bombers. Start capturing
cities as well--with that
airport, you can build
additional Bombers. On the
second day, attack the Missiles
and Anti-Air with your Bombers.
If you can't, then keep
destroying units until you have
a clear path. It may take an
additional day or two, but you
should be able to do it fairly
easily.

Your Dusters are effective
against Infantry type units and
all aerial units, so have them
harm B Copters as well. When all
of them have fallen, you can
easily invade his base with your
Bombers and Dusters with no
opposition. If you don't want to
wait a while to destroy all of
his units because your Bombers
will run out of ammo (forcing
you to retreat to your Rig/Temp
Airport), just block off enemy
units and airdrop an Infantry
onto his HQ. It's a quick and
efficient way of finishing the
mission. Just destroy the War
Tank parked on his HQ and you're
good to finish.

S Rank Notes--This is pretty
easy to finish, and moderately
so to S Rank. As like most
predeployed missions, rush The
Beast's island, and put an
Infantry in the T Copter and go
for his HQ. As you rush the
southern area with Dusters and
Bombers (destroy the Anti-Air
and Missiles quickly). This will
make most of this units flee
north, so block the passage with
your Dusters, destroy the War
Tank on the HQ, then capture it
for a high Speed score.

===================
~~C10-Almost Home~~
===================
Time Limit--7 Days CO--Will
Enemy CO--The Beast Terms--Rout
enemy or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--3 Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Recon, Rig, Anti-
Air, Tank, Missiles, T Copter, 2
Dusters, B Copter, Fighter Enemy
Units--Infantry, Mech, Recon,
Artillery, Tank, Anti-Air, War
Tank, 2 B Copters, Duster,
Fighter

This is easily the hardest
mission you've faced yet, and is
harder than several of the
upcoming missions as well. The
Beast is going to have a decent
economy after several days, and
he has two factories and an
airport. The Beast also starts
with several aerial units, and
you will need to take them all
out so you can begin an
offensive.

Two of your units that start
close to The Beast's base will
likely die. The western Infantry
so head for the cities farther
west. You need that factory and
airport as soon as possible.
Load your Infantry and Mech into
the Rig and T Copter and get
them over there quickly. You
need to have a larger economy
than The Beast so you can
outproduce him.

Don't forget about your air
units in the top-right corner!
If you don't use them, getting
rid of The Beast's air force
will be significantly harder.
What you want to do is sacrifice
your B Copter to lure the
Fighter near you, then kill it
with a Duster then your Fighter.
You want your Fighter to remain
at full health so it can destroy
is B Copters rather quickly.

Continue the capture of the
center area and all of the
cities nearby. It will
eventually be 14 buildings
versus his 10. Continue making
Tanks from both bases. Make a B
Copter every now and then. Don't
waste your time sitting around
until you have funds for
Bombers. It only takes one 7000G
Anti-Air to make a 20000G Bomber
almost worthless, and it's not
worth the funds. B Copters are
cheap, and force The Beast to
waste his funds on Anti-Airs,
which your Tanks can dispose of
easily.

Once you're ready to make the
push into his base, get some
Infantry to capture his cities,
worsening his production value
so he can't counter your forces
as easily. You'll be wanting a
bunch of Tanks, several B
Copters so that he'll focus on
building Anti-Airs which won't
be able, again, to harm your
Tank force. Once you overrun his
forces, park some units over his
factories and airport, then wipe
out whatever he has left. His
War Tank can be hard to destroy,
so use an Anti-Tank to scare it
into retreating (or attacking,
bascially its suicide).

Another key is to keep your
Missiles alive is you invade his
base. Position it near his
airport, rendering it useless as
Missiles can OHKO all air units.
Have your Tanks and a Bomber gun
for his HQ. Target any Anti-Airs
first--you want your Bomber (and
hopefully Dusters you kept)
alive. If you rush early you can
easily overrun him. The longer
you wait, the harder it will be
to break the eventual stalemate.
You can easily finish by day 9
if you hurry.

The Beast will attack your air
units primarily, then goes for
your Tanks. Use that to your
advantage.

S Rank Notes--To S Rank this
mission, you will need to wrap
it up rather quickly. Don't give
The Beast time to build an army.
If you do, the stalemate will
take a long time to break,
causing your Speed score and
Technique (as you'll be making a
ton of units to break it) to
drop rather quickly. By
finishing it fast, all of your
scores will remain high,
resulting in a simple S Rank.

=====================
~~C11-A Storm Brews~~
=====================
Time Limit--4 Days CO--Lin
Partner CO--Davis Enemy CO--
Tasha Terms--Rout enemy or
capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Tank, Md Tank, Rig, Rockets, 3
Gunboats, 2 Landers Enemy Units
--Infantry, Mech, Recon,
Artillery, Rig, Md Tank, 3
Gunboats, Cruiser

This is a fairly easy mission,
and also isn't one difficult to
S Rank. Gunboats only have one
ammo, so use them to take out
the nearby Gunboat. Have the Rig
on shore resupply the Gunboats.
As for your landers, bring both
types of Tanks, the Rockets, and
an Infantry to the southern
island.

Once there, form a defensive
wall so your Tanks can hit hard,
and your Rockets is not only
safe from fire, but can hit them
back. Attack the enemy ships if
they get into your range--your
Gunboats can become quite
irritating to resupply with each
fight they get into. Davis won't
be doing anything, so leave him
alone. Get a Mech over there to
destroy the Mech Tasha sends to
Davis' island.

With a Tank wall, and Rockets
right behind them, destroying
all of Tasha's land units should
be quite simple. Defeating her
Gunboats are rather hard, so
just go for a HQ capture. Bring
the Rig to the mainland so you
can quickly get an Infantry to
the HQ.

S Rank Notes--You'll want to
work fast on this mission. With
a low time limit, simply run for
the HQ. Try and distract the
Gunboats with your own Gunboats,
use your Rockets to bombard them
so your Lander to get an
Infantry to her HQ quickly. Use
your Tanks to distract her main
land forces, and you can
hopefully end the mission very
quickly.

=======================
~~C12-History of Hate~~
=======================
Time Limit--4 Days
CO--Will
Partner CO--Waylon
Enemy CO--Tasha
Terms--Rout enemy

Starting Units--2 Rigs, B
Copter, Duster, 2 Submarines, 2
Gunboats, 2 Cruisers, Battleship
Enemy Units--B Copter, Bomber,
Fighter, 3 Gunboats, Submarine,
2 Cruisers, 3 Battleships

This mission may not look
difficult, but if you get
careless with your units this
will quickly turn impossible.
Try and lure Tasha's units out
and towards you, so that way you
can damage them severely,
rendering them worthless. You
have access to a Battleship in
this mission. Get used to the
fact that they can move and
shoot on the same turn.

Tasha has three Battleships, so
you'll need to use your
Submarines effectively in order
to destroy them quickly. Be sure
to dive them so the enemy
Cruisers can't destroy them.
Destroy the ships in the south
before you engage the ships and
aerial untis up north. Waylon
can handle himself for the most
part up north.

Once the south is taken care of,
there should only be a few units
and planes remaining in the
north. It's key to keep your
Battleship and Cruiser alive so
this mission can be ended
quickly and easily.

S Rank Notes--As you can see
from the time limit, you will
need to work quickly to earn a
decent score. The enemy
Submarine is a huge threat to
your Battleship, so have your
Cruiser destroy it after having
another unit find it after it
submerges. Once the enemy
Battleships and Submarines are
gone, quickly finish off the
weaker units that are wondering
around.

=========================
~~C13-Greyfield Strikes~~
=========================
Time Limit--6 Days CO--Brenner
Partner CO--Greyfield Enemy CO--
Gage Terms--Rout enemy or
capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--2 Infantry, Rig,
2 Gunboats, Lander, Cruiser,
Submarine, Battleship, Carrier
Enemy Units--Infantry, Mech,
Tank, Artillery, Anti-Air, Md
Tank, 2 Missiles, Cruiser, 2
Gunboats, Lander, Battleship,
Carrier

You've got access to Carriers
now, as well as ports so you can
produce additional naval units.
Carriers, if they don't move on
their turn, can produce a
Seaplane for 15000G. It also
takes one of their material
points, and they have four when
built, so basically they can
build only four Seaplanes.
Seaplanes are insanely powerful,
but be careful of their low 40
fuel.

As for the mission, send
Infantry to the center and
southern islands and capture the
port and factory. The catch to
this mission is that every few
days Greyfield will halt all of
a particular unit. He'll
announce what type of unit it is
the day before, so don't send
those units into a spot where
you won't be able to get them
back safely.

I can't determine what units
Greyfield chooses to halt. I'm
guessing it's which ones have
done the most monetary damage
prior to the last time he halted
units. Although, he has halted
my Landers on more than one
occasion, so it probably is
completely random. In any case,
what you want to do is get
several Landers to ferry over
Tanks and Md Tanks to the enemy
island. You will also want
several Submarines to take down
Gage's naval units. You may be
needing Cruisers--Gage tends to
build several Seaplanes himself
over the course of the battle.

Just makes sure you can make the
best out of whatever units get
stopped. Be sure to use a
variety of them--using just
Seaplanes, while powerful, is
disasterous if they all get
stopped in one turn. Flood the
enemy island and finish Gage by
rout, or just use a Rig to get
an Infantry over to the HQ.

S Rank Notes--It can be hard.
This mission is insanely
annoying with that fat jerk
constantly halting your units.
Just rush the mainland and try
to take his HQ. I'd advise
against using many Seaplanes
because Gage is more than
capable of destroying them
quickly. Work fast and try not
to produce too many unnecessary
units.

=========================
~~C14-A Hero's Farewell~~
=========================
Time Limit--10 Days CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--Forsythe Terms--Rout
enemy or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Mech, Bike, 2 Tanks, Artillery,
Md Tank, Rig, Missiles, Rockets,
Cruiser, Submarine, 2 B Copters
Enemy Units--3 Mechs, 2 Tanks, 2
Md Tanks, Artillery, Rockets,
Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier, B
Copter

This level looks insanely hard,
but it is actually fairly
simple. The main threat in the
entire level is the lone Rockets
up north behind the plasma wall,
and Forsythe's navy. If you can
take command of the seas by
destroying his Battleship, as
well as build an army to take
down the plasma wall and rush
the factory that has a Rocket
sitting nearby, then you can win
this mission.

Doing so is fairly harder. Take
your time with your navy. You
will need a second Submarine,
and maybe a Gunboat to attack
the Cruiser that can kill your
Submarines. Target the
Battleship first. The Carrier
may sound like a better target,
but Forsythe only has around 17
buildings once the battle gets
settled in. Wasting all those
funds on a Seaplane is actually
advised. Just have a Cruiser or
two close to the Carrier so the
Seaplanes can meet a swift
destruction shortly after coming
out (and even then, your
Missiles can also take them out,
provided you have meatshields
for them).

You can rush the Rockets at the
start, even. Just rush a B
Copter up there and you can
destroy it rather handily.
Problem is, Forsythe will often
build another Rockets in the
factory nearby. Luckily, he's
rather stupid with it, and
doesn't park it back on the
nearby city. Once you capture
the airport to the east, Bombers
will run rampant on this map.

If you want, before destroying a
meteor letting the plasma wall
exist, you can capture some of
Forsythe's cities. Just have a B
Copter guard an Infantry
capturing, and only when an
Anti-Air is nowhere nearby.
Crippling his economy is quite
recommended.

Before destroying the meteor, as
mentioned, you need an army.
Several Bombers, Tanks, 2
Rockets, and a few Md Tanks will
be sufficient. Your aim is to
park a unit, any unit, on his
factory. Once you do that,
destroy anything else nearby.
Then, stall until you can
capture his factory. The battle
is pretty much over once you do
this. If you still have a strong
going army when you overrun his
factory, go for his HQ.

Push your entire army up the
bridge and park something on the
factories and airport up there.
If you can't destroy his
remaining naval units, capture
his HQ. If it's faster to rout
him, obviously do so.

The turning point is the rush
for the middle factory. Save
before doing so, and if you
fail, reload to strength your
troops. Have some Anti-Airs or
Missiles to kill Seaplanes and
any other air units Forsythe may
create.

S Rank Notes--This mission isn't
as bad as people make it out to
be, and neither is the S Rank.
If you can finish by day 20 you
will still get 100 points in
speed. Rushing the plasma wall,
as usual, is the turning point.
Try not to make unnecessary
units to keep your Technique
high. Rushing for rout is the
faster option more likely than
not. Two Battleships is all you
should need to keep the seas in
your possession, a single
Bomber, couple of Anti-Airs, and
a bunch of Tanks will easily win
the mission quickly, and well
enough for an S Rank.

===================
~~C15-Icy Retreat~~
===================
Time Limit--9 Days CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--Waylon Terms--Clear a
path for either blue unit to
reach the blue city; failure if
both blue units are killed

Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Tank, Md Tank, Artillery, 2
Anti-Airs, Rig Enemy Units--
Infantry, Mech, Bike, 2 Recons,
Artillery, 2 Tanks, Rockets, 3
War Tanks, 2 B Copters

You have no factories of your
own, but that isn't the concern.
Your objective is to clear a
path to the blue city to the
west and let one of the blue
units get onto the city. Once
that happens, you win the
mission.

Too bad Waylon isn't going to
let that be easy. The mentally
challenged blue computer often
suicides itself into the enemy
units as it tries to keep moving
left, so you will need to clear
the path with no hesitation. New
to this mission are CO Zones and
Meters. When a CO is boarded in
a unit, such as Brenner being in
the Md Tank, for every 5 HP of
damage dealt by a unit inside
the CO Zone, part of the CO
Meter fills. Units in the CO
Zone get an attack and defensive
boost.

To make matters worse, there is
a snowy weather condition. This
means that all of your units
lose one space of movement.
Start by moving your troops
left, having an Anti-Air destroy
the nearby B Copter. Have your
Tank attack the Rockets. They
will rip through Gage's units,
and if both die, you fail the
mission.

Position your Artillery near the
southern meteor, and have it and
your Tank attack the meteor. It
will be destroyed on the second
or third day of attacking. Once
it's destroyed, rush to destroy
Waylon's Artillery that probably
destroyed Gage's Recon.

After doing this, you need to
escort the blue Infantry to the
city. Doesn't sound hard? It
will be. Once the plasma wall is
gone, keep moving west. Block
off the enemy Recons with your
Tank, Anti-Airs, and Rig. You'll
be needing to destroy them, so
hurry and do that. Retreat an
Anti-Air to destroy the B Copter
Waylon is sending your way, and
destroy the Recon up north to
allow the Infantry or Recon (if
it lived) passage to the city.
You don't need to destroy the
second plasma wall.

S Rank Notes--Not really much to
say here. If you finish the
mission, more likely then not
you'll get an S Rank. I find it
impossible to NOT get an S Rank
if you finish this mission, but
that's just me. You have a huge
time limit to work with, and
even with a loss of many units
you will still end with a high
Technique. Overall, not much of
a problem.

===================

CO--Greyfield Terms--Rout enemy
or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Anti-Air, B Copter, T
Copter Enemy Units--3 Tanks, 2
Md Tanks, War Tank

This is another Fog of War
mission, and you won't have a CO
in command for the first few
days. The thing to notice is
that you should put your War
Tank in the forest that's right
next to it. That way, Greyfield
will NEVER try attacking you
once he realized there's a
mammoth tank blocking the way.
Also, you can prevent him from
getting any other properties on
the map.

Get the Infantry on the
mountains to capture the
factory, and move your T Copter
to the other Infantry so it can
board it. When you can, move it
to the airport and capture that,
as well as the cities near it.

When that T Copter is freed,
have it send an Infantry to the
northwest corner and capture the
factory up there. Once you have
that factory, you can capture
the other nearby cities. It
won't take long before you have
a ton of cities compared to
Greyfield's measely seven. Start
forming an army of Tanks and
Bombers (you've got the funds to
mass produce them). Once you
think you have a decent sized
army, invade Greyfield's base.

Now, in this mission and from
here on you can have your CO
board a unit. Put a unit over a
factory (or an air unit over an
airport), and on the next turn
instead of choosing Wait,
provided you have half the cost
of the unit, you can choose to
have the CO board the unit. The
rest of the functions of doing
so were shown last mission.

However, when the CO Meter is
full, which is possible if you
don't let your CO unit die, you
can use your CO Power by
selecting your CO unit and
choosing it. Use your CO Zone to
your advantage when invading
Greyfield's base. To be honest,
considering he can't build more
than a Tank or Anti-Air each
turn, he isn't much of a threat.

S Rank Notes--Four Bombers and
several Tanks/Md Tanks will
easily be enough to wipe out
Greyfield. Use a Flare so you
can see his hidden units when
you invade, and target Anti-Airs
first. Have Will board a Md Tank
and try to charge the CO Meter.
It's not necessary you use the
CO Power because having a wide
CO Zone will help ground troops
in the zone get a power boost,
helpful for demolishing
Greyfield.

===================
~~C17-Icy Retreat~~

Talon Gun or rout enemy

Starting Units--3 Infantry,
Mech, Tank, Anti-Air, Rockets,
Rig, T Copter Enemy Units--2
Mechs, Tank, War Tank, 2 Anti-
Tanks, Rockets, Missiles

The Talon Gun looks to be a
formidable weapon, and you have
the option of just routing the
enemy, but if you're doing that
you will constantly be having
the chance to destroy the Talon
Gun. In that case, why aren't
you ending it faster? Unless you
like a challenge!

But for those that want the easy
road, here's a DBD guide Yoshi
on the Wars World News forums
made that works flawlessly each
time, and is quick and easy:

Day 1-
Move Tank 2S 3W
Move Anti-air 3S 3W
Move Rocket 2S 3W

Day 2-
Move Rocket 3S 2W
Move Tank 2S
Move Anti-air 1W 2S
Build a Bomber

Day 3-
Move Rocket 1S 3W
Move Tank 2W 1N
Move Anti-Air 4W
Move Bomber 4W 3S
Build a Bomber

Day 4- Move those 3 vehicles 1N
1W Load Tasha into the Bomber
and move it 2S 4W Move the other
Bomber 1W

Day 5- Attack the Anti-Tank with
the Rocket

Day 6- Destroy the Anti-Tank
with the Rocket Destroy the
Missile with Tasha Finish Talon
Gun with the other Bomber

I've never seen this fail, and
is useful in getting the Talon
Guns Destroyed medals. But, do
you want a challenge? Going for
rout?

That's significantly harder. You
start with more properties, but
there are so many close to
Tabitha that she will easily
catch up to you. Use Rigs and T
Copters to have Infantry reach
far away properties as quickly
as possible. Note that Tabitha
has insane boosts when she
boards a unit. It will take a
lot of effort to kill that unit,
and you damn well want to kill
it. If she gets a larger CO
Zone, then that means more units
can bask in her powerhouse
glory.

The Talon Gun itself is a
massive problem. It'd be nice if
you could destroy it without
ending the mission. You've got
little chance of capturing the
properties in its firing zone.
You also need to make sure you
stay out of the firing range. 5
damage to every unit in it is
highly annoying, so you'll need
to lure units out. Problem is,
the units resting infront of the
Talon Gun originally will NEVER
move. Try using Rockets lying
outside of the Talon Gun's range
to destroy those units.

Past that, it's just
outproducing her and owning more
properties. You will find
yourself at a bit of a
stalemate, and once broken you
can start capturing her
properties. Go for her factories
first, then any other cities
nearby. If you capture one of
her factories, then rout is
almost imminent.

S Rank Notes--Follow the DBD
guide. Guarenteed S Rank. If you
want to do it by rout, then it's
highly unlikely you'll succeed.
You'll never finish quickly
enough to get a high enough
Speed score, and the sheer
amount of units you'll have to
create will diminish your
Technique. At least your Power
will be high!

==========================
~~C18-Panic in the Ranks~~

Tanks, Md Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, 3 B Copters, Duster,
Fighter, Bomber

It seems that you are
overpowered, but your units are
quite the match for Greyfield.
You just need to rely on your
partners, the blue team. The
problem is that they aren't
following orders at the moment.
To get them to begin attacking,
you need to move the War Tank
Will is inside ontop of the blue
Com Tower south of your starting
position.

Once you do that, it's time to
go crazy killing Greyfield's
units. Your units are effective
at wiping out the ground troops,
while the blue team will be
effective at Greyfield's aerial
units (and has a Bomber for
ground support).

Don't worry about your partner
units. They can handle
themselves quite fine on their
own, so just worry about
demoilishing Greyfield's troops
as quickly as you can. Try not
to lose too many units. If you
do, you'll find it difficult to
even finish the mission.

S Rank Notes--You have to finish
this mission in a few days in
order to have a somewhat decent
Speed score. Power and Technique
shouldn't be too much of a
problem to get around 100, but
you'll need a decent Speed
score. If you don't, it may drag
you below 300. It can be quite
annoying since they don't give
you much time to get enough
points.

=================
~~C19-Salvation~~
=================
Time Limit--2 Days CO--Gage
Enemy CO--None Terms--Rout enemy
or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--3 Infantry, 2
Mechs, 3 Bikes, Recon, Tank
Enemy Units--10 Infantry, 10
Mechs, 2 Tanks, War Tank

You're given no factories, so
how is this possible? Well,
you're given several silos. Move
any Infantry type unit onto a
silo and you can launch a
missile anywhere on the map that
does 3 HP of damage to all units
in its 3 space radius. Also, all
of these units are weakened to
begin with, except the War Tank.
It's out of ammo, and is very
low on fuel. Thusly, it isn't
even much of a threat.

All you need to do at the start
is spread your units out. The
enemy gets two silos to use, and
they can get two more if you
don't race for those on the
outer edge of the map. Use two
silos to injure the War Tank and
the units around it, then use
the rest the damage further
other units around the map. Be
aware that they have two Com
Towers, so their defense and
attack will be boosted.

Routing will take awhile, so
clear out any units near their
HQ, then sneak a Bike onto it
and end the mission quickly. If
you work fast, you can win on
day 4 or 5, which gets a decent
Speed score.

S Rank Notes--You need to rush
this mission, avoiding getting
too injured by the War Tank, and
capture the HQ for a high Speed
score. Be sure to have your
Recon and Tank destroy several
units to boost the Power score,
and you'll be set for an S Rank.
It may take several tries
because of how sparadic the
computer can be in how it joins
units.

~~C20-Waylon Flies Again~~
==========================
Time Limit--12 Days CO--Will

Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, Anti-Air Partner
Units--2 Tanks, 2 Anti-Airs, 2
Missiles Enemy Units--2 B
Copters, 2 Dusters, Bomber, 3
Fighters

This is one of the hardest
missions in the game, as most
people will admit. Personally, a
simple rushing strategy is all
that's needed to win and achieve
an S Rank. First off, things
will look bad from the start.
You have to capture all of your
own unit making properties, and
then you have to cope with the
fact there's a mountain range
preventing quick land access to
the center area.

Waylon has access to the center
area quickly, and he will abuse
it and try to steal the cities
under your control in the area.
Your primary objective is to
stop him as quickly as possible,
then launch an offensive in the
center. Begin capturing the
airport and factory on the first
day, have the Bike and Mech go
south for more properties, and
send the lone Infantry north.
You will need to capture a ton
of properties in a short amount
of time. Waylon isn't going to
wait around.

Once the factory and airport is
in control, you can stop
Waylon's massive air force. A
single Missile and Fighter is
all you need. Waylon will never
be stupid enough to attack your
units if one of these air-raping
machines is around. He
occasionally will, but it's very
rare, and it's only if he has
multiple air units that can
strike near the Fighter/Missiles
in one turn.

Build a Rockets, too, and keep
it near the factory. Position it
so the Rockets can fire on any
Infantry trying to capture the
northern two cities. A second
Rocket can protect one of the
lower cities, which makes it so
that Waylon realistically can
only capture one of your cities
easily. After you have some
serious income, take back the
center with several Tanks and
Bombers, with Missile and Anti-
Air support to scare Waylon's
aerial units away from you.

Kill all of his Infantry and
whatever else he's brought into
the center, then play the
waiting game. When you have
control of the center, Waylon
mainly only tries Infantry
suicide missions to take your
cities, and those should fail
miserably. What you want is to
mass several Bombers, three or
four Fighters, several Anti-
Airs, couple of Tanks, and tons
of Mechs. Yes, Mech rushing here
is advised. Oh, and put Will
into a unit and get his CO Meter
charged. Four movement for Mechs
in a single turn is damn scary.

By the 20th day you should have
all of the cities in the center
and west side of the map in your
possession, and the center
should be overcrowding with
units. This has given Waylon
time to form a defense, so let's
make it crumble. Initiate your
CO Power if you were able to
charge it, then flood Waylon's
area, weakening everything in
your path. Personally, I find a
ton of weakened units better
than killing several and leaving
a bunch of full health ones.

Since it's pretty hard to
destroy his air force
(especially if Waylon put
himself in a Fighter or Duster)
due to the fact his CO Zone
grants aerial units insane
defense, going for an HQ capture
is advised. You've got tons of
Mechs. Get one on a Rig and drop
it over. Park units on his
factories and airports for
safety, then form a wall around
his HQ. This ensures the Mech
can safely capture while the
walling units take the heat from
whatever units survived the
initial rush.

If the tactic worked, this will
result in a slow but simple
victory. You can finish faster,
but it's far simpler to fail
because you don't have enough
ground support. Several of
Waylon's Fighters and Anti-Airs
will annihilate an air force
with no ground cover. Keep that
in mind.

S Rank Notes--Nothing new to say
here. If you follow all the tips
above and work as quickly as
possible, you can finish with a
decent time score and the rest
should be rather high. Good luck
--this'll be a long battle.

====================
~~C21-Lin's Gambit~~
====================
Time Limit--12 Days CO--Lin
Enemy CO--Greyfield Terms--Rout
enemy or capture enemy HQ;
failure if 40 days pass

Starting Units--3 Infantry,
Mech, Bike, Flare, Tank, War
Tank, 2 Rockets, 2 Rigs, Anti-
Tank, 2 Submarines, Lander,
Gunboat, 3 Cruisers, Battleship
Enemy Units--3 Mechs, Tank, Md
Tank, War Tank, Anti-Tank, 4
Rockets, 4 Battleships, 2
Carriers, 2 Gunboats, 2 Landers

You have a 40 day time limit for
this mission, but it shouldn't
take much more than 20 to finish
the mission. As Lin says, you
need to take control over the
seas. Not only that, but you
shouldn't focus very much on
your land assault. Have your
Rockets bombard anything that
cross the bridges, and use
Flares to seek out additional
targets. What you want are naval
units, and lots of them.

Begin capturing buildings, and
have an Infantry get in a Rig
and send it towards the western
island. Don't try capturing
anything there--Greyfield's
Battleships will kill the
Infantry in a flash. You're
given several Submarines, and
you may want to rush them to his
Battleships, but note that he
has two Carriers. If he gets ANY
Seaplanes flying around, you
will be in serious trouble. Rush
your Subs over to his Carriers
and sink them as quickly as
possible, before he has the
chance to build several
Cruisers.

After that, destroy his
Battleships, and use your
Battleship to attack any
Cruisers that get built. While
doing this, have a Mech get put
on a Lander and sent to the
center island and capture the
factory. Greyfield will shuttle
units here too, and if you have
the factory, you can defend it
from assault.

If you worked quickly and
effectively, and didn't let a
Submarine get killed, then
Greyfield's navy should have
crumbled quickly. Begin
capturing the port on the
western island, as well as the
center island. Your goal is to
create an unimposed navy, and
several land units to assist.
You want five or six
Battleships, and two Carriers to
get somewhere between four to
eight Seaplanes flying around.
As for land units, a Rig or two
to keep the Seaplanes fueled
during the assualt. Take a few
Bikes during the assault as well
so you can start capturing his
cities.

Have one of the Battleships
guard Greyfield's ports so
anything he builds is rendered
useless. Have two Cruisers there
as well incase he makes a
Submarine. During the land
assualt, lead with Seaplanes.
Greyfield is hiding four Rockets
in various places, so be careful
where you put your Battleships
and land units. Go for the
factory and park a Seaplane on
it, having everything else
decimate everything around them.

Two Rockets are resting near his
HQ, one in the mountains near
the center factory, and another
either near the bridges hiding
in a forest, or hiding at the
northeast corner of the map. Be
sure your Battleships aren't hit
by them, as that can render them
useless.

S Rank Notes--You'll need to
rush this for a good Speed
score. To preserve your
Technique, try not to produce
too many units. Turn down the
amount of Battleships and
Seaplanes you use to keep the
score high, and retreat any
weakened units. Remember that
Carriers repair planes, so use
that to keep expensive Seaplanes
alive longer. Rush Greyfield
with a decent army and he will
still crumble.

=====================
~~C22-The Great Owl~~
=====================
Time Limit--7 Days CO--Lin Enemy
CO--Penny Terms--Rout enemy or
capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--3 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, 2 Anti-Airs, 2 War
Tanks, B Copter, 3 Fighters
Enemy Units--Anti-Air, 3 Tanks,
3 War Tanks, 4 Anti-Tanks,
Artillery, 2 Rockets, 2
Missiles, 3 Bombers, 2 Fighters

This certainly looks to be a
hard mission, but it is easily
doable if you follow the
instructions in the War Room. Of
course, figuring out how to do
them is harder. What you're
aiming to do is capture the
southeast factory that Penny
already has under control. To do
so, you'll need to make a light
army and then rush it, having
your Bike capture it.

Also of note is the Great Owl
itself. See the ruins in the
middle of the map? Each turn the
giant bomber drops a load there,
injuring any unit in its three
space radius by 5 HP. You should
be smart enough not to go
through there, but Penny sure as
hell isn't. Her units will get
attacked as she tries the go for
your army, and her forces will
get reduced to nothing.
Basically, her starting units
that actually move aren't too
effective.

Begin capturing properties
immidiately. The airport to the
north will never be seeing use
because of the Missiles hanging
out in its range, so you'll be
producing Bombers from the
southern airport instead. Begin
forming your army around the
southernmost border of the Great
Owl's attack radius. Penny has
several air units, but no
airports to fuel and heal them.
Lure the Fighters toward you
with your B Copter, then kill
the Fighters with Anti-Airs and
your very own Fighters from the
start.

Lure the Bombers with sacrifical
ground units (Recons will do
fine). Have the Fighters and
Anti-Airs repeat the process
with them. While doing this,
have a Rockets behind your main
force, but always walled in by
your units so it's safe from any
attack. You will want two
Rockets as you move toward the
southeast factory.

Keep pushing your way down
there. At around turn 10, with
several additional Bombers on
your side and a weakened army,
you should be close to or
already have captured the
factory. Once you have, the
battle is basically won. Capture
all of Penny's nearby cities for
even more funds. At this point,
Penny is likely rushing your HQ
with Infantry. Make an Anti- Air
or Recon back at your HQ for
protection, because we all know
several 1 HP Infantry are scary.

Back in your army, mass Tanks
and Bombers and get ready for an
assault. Line a group of 5 or so
Bombers outside of Missiles
range, and your Tanks outside of
Rockets range. When ready,
assault their main weaknesses.
Take down Missiles and Rockets,
then gun for Anti-Tanks and
Anti-Airs. You will lose several
units, but the devastation to
Penny's army is worth it. Park
something on her factory, then
have the Bomber squad clean up
whatever is left over. Putting
Lin inside a unit, preferably a
Bomber, will make things go a
lot smoother.

S Rank Notes--Don't wait too
long. I took 28 days and still
got an S Rank, but my Speed
score suffered. You don't need
as big of an army as you may
think to take down Penny's
forces once the factory is
yours. Several Tanks and Bombers
will do. Keeping units to a
minimum will save your
Technique, and Speed as you
won't be wasting several days
amassing an army.

========================
~~C23-Sacrificial Lamb~~
========================
Time Limit--8 Days CO--Will
Enemy CO--Tabitha Terms--Rout
enemy or capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--3 Infantry, 3
Mechs, Tank, 4 War Tanks, 2
Anti-Tanks, 3 Cruisers, 2
Battleships, 4 Landers Enemy
Units--3 Mechs, 2 Tanks,
Artillery, Anti-Air, Anti-Tnak,
5 Rockets, 2 Cruisers, 2
Gunboats, Lander

This may be a bit of a long
mission because you need to
ferry units to the main island
with Landers. Your main goal is
to get Mechs (use those already
in Landers from the start) to
reach the silos on the northwest
and southeast corners of the
map. Use a Battleship to blast
away a meteor up north so you
can access those silos, and have
the other Battleship begin
attacking the Rockets. Once you
make your land assault, you want
none of those Rockets hanging
around.

On days 2, 3, and 4, the Great
Owl will attack you. It drops a
bomb where it can cause the most
monetary damage. Obviously, your
War Tanks and Battleships are at
risk. Try to spread them out by
the end of the second day so you
don't risk both getting injured.
In fact, if you group all four
Landers together, you can direct
the Great Owl towards them. Just
make sure none of the weakened
Landers get sunk after that--
Tabitha will build Submarines
every now and then, and Gunboats
are quite effective against
Landers.

For the silos, launch them at
the Rockets to weaken them. Once
weakened, attack the Tanks. On
the fifth day, drop all of your
units on the main island in a
position where few units can
attack them. Your goal is to
first prevent Tabitha from
capturing the factory. Then,
destroy any units around the
factory, including those
Rockets, and capture it
yourself. Then, capture all of
Tabitha's buildings on the
southern part of the island.

Once you do all this, form an
army. Several Seaplanes, backed
up with Tanks, some Rockets and
Artillery, and an Anti-Tank will
be sufficient. Destroy the
meteor that isn't on the corner
of the river. The destroyed
meteor leaves a plains tile, so
you can cross to her HQ. Target
the Rockets hiding behind the
destroyed meteor first, then
rush for her factories. If you
can destroy what few units she
has guarding her HQ, you can
capture it. If she neglected her
navy, you can probably rout her
faster instead of capturing the
HQ. Either way, a quick rush
from day 5 onwards is the key to
winning this mission.

S Rank Notes--This mission is a
pain to S Rank. The time limit
is unforgiving, and you have to
really limit the number of units
you build while at the same time
destroying a ton of enemy units.
It's highly annoying. Don't take
your time on this. Rush the
island on day 5 and kill without
any remorse. Don't capture every
building--just Tabitha's and the
Com Towers for extra power.

=====================
~~C24-Crash Landing~~
=====================
Time Limit--7 Days CO--Lin Enemy
CO--Penny Terms--Rout enemy or
capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--Mech, Recon, 2
Anti-Airs, 2 Tanks, 2 Md Tanks,
2 War Tanks, Artillery, Anti-
Tank, 2 Rockets, Rig Enemy Units
--Infantry, Mech, Bike, 2
Recons, 3 Tanks, Md Tank, 2 War
Tanks, Artillery, Rockets, Anti-
Air, Anti-Tank

This is a fun mission. There's
no buildings, so it's a straight
up predeploy battle. Basically,
there's no real need for advice
here. All you need to do is
destroy all of Penny's units
while losing as few units as
possible. This is highly
important.

And this mission just spells
first turn advantage. Bombard as
many strong units as you can on
the first turn. Ignore the
Infantry type units for the most
part (maybe have your Recon
attack, but nothing else) and
focus on damaging all the types
of Tanks, the Anti-Tank, the
Rockets, especially their War
Tank, and anything you are
capable of injuring.

Destroying everything should
prove easy. Sadly, that's not
all there is to the battle. Once
all of her initial units are
killed, six reinforcements will
arrive.

There will be three Tanks on the
left, and three Rockets on the
right. They appear the instant
all of Penny's original forces
are destroyed. Get your units
into position so you can attack
them when they appear. Focus on
the Tanks and let the Rockets
come to you.

Once the reinforcements are
destroyed, more will come in.
The second wave has three Tanks
on the right, and three Rockets
on the left. Same process again
here, so it should be easy
provided you kept enough strong
units alive.

The final wave has just six
Rockets, so it should be
extremely easy to destroy.
Getting the first strike is
crucial so not too many units
are lost once Penny gets her
turn.

S Rank Notes--An easy S Rank if
you were able to finish this
mission without getting the
majority of your units killed.
Keep most of them alive for a
high technique, and obviously
you'll finish faster with a
larger army.

capture enemy HQ

Starting Units--Mech, Anti-Air,
Tank, 2 Md Tanks, Duster Enemy
Units--Recon, 2 Tanks, 6 War
Tanks, Rockets, 3 Missiles, 3
Bombers, Fighter

This is the final difficult
mission in the game. You are
significantly outnumbered at the
start, and Tabitha has an insane
economy compared to your
pathetic single building. On the
first two days, you need to
begin capturing the airport with
your Mech and MUST destroy the
three Missiles. Save on the
first turn and have the Duster
attack the Missiles just inside
of its range. If it doesn't do 2
HP of damage, reload the save
and try again. Destroy the
Missiles with the Md Tank. The
other two Missiles are easily
destroyed with the Anti-
Air/other Tanks, so don't worry.
Also, leave the meteors alone.
They will aid in slowing down
Tabitha.

On day 3, Will will arrive and
becomes the CO for the battle,
and he brings along a crapton of
units, making this more of a
fair fight. What you need to do
is have your Bombers destroy the
meteors so your ground troops
can reach the factory in the
center of the map. Have an
Infantry or Mech get in a T
Copter and bring it over there.
Capture it immediately! Have the
remaining Infantry and Mechs
capture properties near your HQ.

There's a second factory across
a plasma wall that Tabitha will
be gunning for once you get
going. If you're lucky, you can
prevent her from getting it. If
you can bring your Rockets to
the factory, or can build one
from the factory once captured,
before Tabitha begins capturing
the other factory, then the
battle is won. Just kill the
Infantry/Mech/Bike with your
Rockets.

More likely then not, she will
capture that factory. If this
happens, you will need to
capture it yourself before she
puts it to good use. As
mentioned, position a Rockets or
two so you can bombard whatever
she produces out of the factory.
Tabitha has six War Tanks coming
your way, several Bombers, and
two Fighters. Make a Fighter of
your own, two Anti- Tanks, and a
couple of Md Tanks, and keep
your Rockets protected. You need
to push forward to the factory,
and that means destroying those
War Tanks. Destroying them all
isn't necessary--four severely
weakened War Tanks is a lot less
threatening than two destroyed
ones and two at full health!

Once the War Tanks and aerial
units are cleared out, capture
the factory for yourself. At
this point, keep massing an army
and capture Tabitha's cities as
you push yourself eastward.
Bombers and Tanks, with a
Fighters to keep her aerial
units at bay, are the way to go.
As you enter her main base,
Tabitha will likely put herself
into a unit if she hasn't
already. Destroy that unit on
sight. Do NOT let her get her CO
Meter charged, or you will be in
serious trouble.

Once you get into her base,
block her factories and airports
if you can. Capture her HQ if
you think it would be faster, or
continue going for rout.
Overall, as soon as you get both
factories, you essentially have
the mission won.

S Rank Notes--Working fast is
necessary. Don't waste time
making an offensive--as soon as
the first factory is yours, push
to the second one. Maybe give
yourself time to make an Anti-
Tank, but you need to capture
the second factory as quickly as
possible to end this mission
sooner. Don't build an insane
amount of units either. That
should be obvious by now. And
yes, I got 299 points on my
first try. Very saddening.
Hopefully you can S Rank this
with well over 300 points if you
play well.

I have two strategies. A day by
day guide that is nearly
flawless that will achieve an S
Rank in swift time, and a method
for routing for those who want a
challenge. And I'll admit,
routing is quite difficult.

Here's the day by day guide if
you want to get this damn
mission over and done with (or
if you want a brainless method
for doing it nine more times to
get all the Nests Destroyed
medals). This method was created
by SkyN3t:

Note: The Western Base refers to
the units and buildings in the
middle and left side of the map.
The Southern Base refers to the
units and buildings on the
southern portion of the map and
the eastern part. Also, incase
you aren't good with cardinal
directions, North is up, South
is down, West is left, and East
is right.

Midway through I combine them
into Western Base and Southern
Base. It shouldn't make it any
harder to follow.

Day 7- ~Western Base~ Move Will
2N 2E and destroy right laser
Have War Tank destroy center
laser Have Bomber (or retreat it
if it's too weak and substitute
a stronger unit) destroy the
final laser

There you go! An easy S-Rank for
you! Just so you know, the main
factor here is when Caulder
joins his wounded War Tanks
together. Their positions can
slightly alter the results of
Days 5 and 6. Just improvise a
bit--at that point, you should
be insanely close to winning
anyways. Also, day 3 can be
skewed if the enemy Fighter
attacks your Fighter and not
your Bomber, making it
impossible to kill the B Copter.
Other then these, just improvise
a little if something goes
differently.

Going for rout? You're insane,
but it's somewhat doable. As it
is obvious, you're going to want
to capture almost every building
in your area as quickly as
possible, and you want to
prevent Caulder from getting any
more properties. Yes, keeping it
around 35 buildings to his 12 is
the best way to finish this
mission.

Remember that The Nest creates
two units each day unless one of
Caulder's units is on the
spawning spot. Another problem
are the mortars, which will
drive you crazy during rout.
They fire alternately each turn,
going for the spot where it can
cause the most monetary damage.
The lasers fire somewhat
randomly. I think it's
predetermined which lasers fire
on which turns, but I'm not
sure. In any case, try to stay
out of their line of fire as
much as possible.

With an insane income, you can
easily overwhelm Caulder's
forces and go for his factories
if you stay out of mortar range
before invasion bursts. Keep
several units near The Nest's
spawn points to injure/destroy
anything that appears. Rockets,
Tanks, and Missiles are needed
to destroy the variety of units
that are made.

Be careful of the unit Caulder
puts himself in (usually a
Fighter if you are Bomber
spamming). Keep Anti-Airs handy
to scare Caulder into a corner
of the map, and keep him there
as you demolish and capture his
main base. Do so quickly! The
longer the battle goes on, the
stronger Caulder is able to
become, and eventually he will
be far too hard to rout.

S Rank Notes--Follow the day by
day guide and you should easily
turn up an S Rank. I don't think
an S Rank is possible by rout.
The best I can do is a B Rank
through rout, so I doubt it
being possible.

~4B.Trial Maps~
---------------
You will unlock several Trial
Maps as you progress through the
campaign. Trial Maps are a way
of testing your skill, and are
completely optional. Maps you
don't unlock from the campaign
are unlocked by beating other
Trial Maps. For instance, you
won't unlock T20 from the
campaign. To unlock most Trial
Maps, like that one, you will
need to beat a Trial Map
adjacent to it. In the T20
example, you'll need to beat
T13, T19, T21, or T27 to unlock
it. There are 38 Trial Maps,
filling all of the empty spaces
on the campaign map.

Trial Maps are like War Room
maps of old. All you have to do
is rout the enemy or capture
their HQ. There's no tricks in
any map, but some can be
insanely hard to finish.

===================
~~T1-Extreme Edge~~
===================
Time Limit--5 Days
CO--Lin
Enemy CO--Waylon

Beating this mission is rather
simple. First, get some T
Copters, an Infantry, and a Mech
for later over to the center
island. Waylon will be shuttling
several Infantry over there
himself. You don't need to
capture buildings, but you do
want to block the path so no T
Copters can arrive. Get a B
Copter over there as well, then
take everything further north.

Your goal is to quickly end this
with an HQ capture. You may want
to save before rushing north. If
nothing is on his airport, then
you can easily finish the map by
putting an extra T Copter on his
airport, and letting the other
drop the Infantry on the HQ. If
something is on the airport,
then wait until you can build a
Duster to destroy it. Use it in
conjunction with yor B Copter to
take it down.

With nothing in your way, you
may be surprised to see Waylon
spams Infantry and Mechs at his
base, but does nothing with
them. While capturing the HQ,
build a Rockets to destroy an
Infantry trying to capture your
HQ. Waylon may succeed if he
reaches your base, so injure
that Infantry when you get the
chance.

Time Limit--12 Days
CO--Lin
Enemy CO--Gage

Aerial units are going to be
dominant in this battle. It's
Fog of War, so you'll need to
work quite fast. There are a ton
of cities all around the map,
and both of you have several
temporary airports set up. The
huge group of cities to the east
should be one of your first
stops, and then getting
everything else in the center,
as well as your half of the map,
quickly is important. Use T
Copters to have your Infantry
reach their destination quickly.
B Copters should follow suit and
destroy any of Gage's Infantry
if you spot them.

About 7 or 8 days in you should
have a sufficient economy going,
and one that is stronger than
Gage's. Start making Tanks and B
Copters like crazy, focusing
more on Tanks. Get several Anti-
Airs going to push back any of
Gage's air units, and have a
Flare sit at the back and fire
flares to reveal the road ahead.

By turn 12 you should be pushing
into Gage's base with an army of
Tanks. Don't stop to push, and
keep making additional Tanks to
kill any units that leaked
through around the center and
towards your base. With two
airports and two factories,
blocking all of them quickly can
be difficult, but I advise going
for the airports. Several Tanks
can take care of almost anything
he builds the following turns.

Go for an HQ capture if you
can't find his remaining units.
If the only ones he has left are
the ones by his HQ, then rout
will end this quickly. Finishing
on day 15 can be possible if you
really rush an HQ capture,
having several units wall around
the capturing Infantry, as well
as stalling newly created units.

Enemy CO--Lin

This map is easily completed in
the five day time limit. As you
can see, there's an open path to
the enemy HQ. With a little
walling, and shoving Will into a
Bike, this is insanely simple.

On the first day, construct two
Bikes. Move them towards the HQ
on the next day, then build two
more Bikes, making sure one is
from the center factory. On the
third day, begin capturing the
HQ, put Will into the Bike in
the center factory, and move
everything to the HQ, trying to
wall around the Bike capturing
it.

On the fourth day, keep
capturing, merge one of the
oncoming Bikes with the one on
the HQ, and attack any of the
Infantry trying to attack you.
On the fifth day you will be
able to capture the HQ, wrapping
up this mission fairly easily.

===================
~~T4-Metro Island~~
===================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Will
Enemy CO--Isabella

This map is quite challenging.
You'll want to conserve caption
funds as you try to capture the
properties as quickly as
possible. Make Artilleries and
Tanks every now and then to try
and disrupt the oncoming army
that Isabella will be sending
towards you, as well as trying
to capture anything that she
captures.

You'll be needing Anti-Tanks
because Isabella loves saving up
funds for War Tanks and Md Tanks
constantly. Obviously, a single
Anti-Tank can easily weaken
those beats down quickly,
leaving them open to assault
from your normal Tanks. Put Will
in a Tank as well to boost the
effectiveness of your direct
attack forces.

It may be a long battle, or a
short one if you move quickly.
If you can capture almost
everything in the center, you've
basically got the battle won.
Make a Rockets every now and
then to scare off Isabella's
forces, as well as to attack any
Infantry that somehow manages to
attempt recapturing your
buildings.

Make the final push into her
base with all your Tanks, Anti-
Tanks and Artillery not far
behind, with Rockets support if
possible. You need to bash
anything built from one of her
four factories quickly, and if
you made Rockets, that won't be
too hard. Alternatively, you can
try Mech rushing this map. I
can't guarentee that will work
well, if at all.

Time Limit--12 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

This is a simple looking map,
but if you aren't careful you
will end up in a long stalemate
with the computer. Both players
have five properties easily
accessible to them--four cities
and a factory. The computer will
always gun for the properties up
north. You have two options.

First, you can try and secure
the north area. If you do so,
you've won the mission because
you can also easily secure the
southern properties because of
how close they are to your base.
The problem is how difficult
this is. Bring a Bike and a
Recon. An enemy Bike will try
capturing the factory, but you
can destroy it by attacking with
the Recon and then your Bike.
After that, begin capturing the
factory on your next turn,
destroy any nearby Infantry with
the Recon, then block the
chokepoint with it to delay the
enemy.

Doing this, you can capture it
and begin defending it. Have a
Md Tank and Anti-Tank built from
the factories down south and
send them up north to help
defend. Also have another Bike
head east and capture the
factory and properties there.

In a short amount of time you
can amass a small army to
overrun the main base. The
computer will send most of their
units north to try and take
those properties which you
should obviously be making well
defended, and that makes some
southern forces easily block
their properties. In about 15
days you can finish the map if
you rush for an HQ capture,
blocking the factories and port,
and get the computer to focus
more on the northern front
(which takes a little luck), and
several Battleships for
assistance is useful.

===================
~~T6-Clear Island~~
===================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Gage
Enemy CO--Greyfield

Greyfield starts with a slight
advantage in this map, with an
additional property. Going for
the southern properties seems
like the logical answer to
quickly winning, but you can try
for faster. It's risky, and
likely to not work, but if you
get a Gunboat and load it with
an Infantry, having a Cruiser
and Battleship assist it, you
can try capturing Greyfield's HQ
if you get lucky and he builds
bad units. You'll want him to
build a Submarine in his
southern port because if built
in the north your Cruiser can
destroy it, and thusly can drop
off the Infantry at his port and
take the HQ.

This doesn't work all that
often, so you can fight it out
normally. You have a naval front
and a ground front that needs to
be split up. Capturing those
properties is essential to give
yourself the advantage, but you
need to defend them as well as
your main base. Don't worry much
about that at first; just grab
properties and defend them
instead of your base. After a
short time you should have a
stable econmoy greater than
Greyfield's, so focus on the
ground units. Build a Submarine
every now and then to counter
the Battleships he occasionally
saves up for.

Keep at it--Greyfield will
crumble under enough pressure.
Don't neglect your navy, as I
stated. If Greyfield gets a
powerful navy going, you could
face losing the map pretty
quickly. Also, put your CO in a
unit at some point. Tank, Anti-
Tank, or an Artillery are good
choices. Get a couple indirect
units on the field and use
Gage's CO Power to really
inflict pain on Greyfield.

===================
~~T7-Tatter River~~
===================
Time Limit--25 Days
CO--Waylon
Enemy CO's--Tasha, Gage, Lin

Yeah, this is one of the few
maps that everyone hates just
for the insane amount of
pointlessness it contains. Look
at the damn thing. Ground units
are esentially useless here
because you can't invade another
team's base with them, so a
bunch of dogfights will be going
on here.

Taking command of the center
area is FAR more important than
the properties on your small
island area. Get some T Copters
running and go for a factory and
an airport in that order. The
computer, when they capture
factories, love producing Anti-
Airs like crazy. Only focus on
Gage for now--Tasha and Lin will
be fighting for their own
territory, so try not to get
involved.

Taking command of the skies is
important, obviously. Anything
Gage captures you will need to
capture right back as soon as
possible. The center airport
will be fought for by all sides,
and you need it. Whoever gets it
will have a clear advantage, but
everyone else will try going for
it at the same time. When the
computer leaves it alone
briefly, kill whatever Infantry
is on the airport and take it
yourself. Keep it defended with
some Anti-Airs and Tanks. You'll
want it later.

This will be an extremely long
battle, and finishing on day 50
still gives you 100 speed
points. For most people,
including myself, this will take
around 70 days. Honestly, what
were they smoking when this map
is made?

Rush an HQ, preferably Gage's
since he's closest. By taking an
HQ you take possession of all
properties that team had, so
your production value basically
doubles. Once one group falls,
and half the map is pretty much
yours, you can easily wipe the
floor with the rest of the enemy
CO's. The only problem is that
despite being pretty easy at
that point, it will still take a
long time. Build up your forces,
use your CO Power every now and
then, and have at thee.
Remember, using Waylon's CO
Power when you invade an HQ is
highly suggested. His air units,
which you HAVE to use to invade,
become almost indestructable for
the turn, so screw those
mountains of Anti-Airs in the
way! Take their HQ's!

===============
~~T8-D Island~~

Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Isabella
Enemy CO--Tasha

A plasma wall blocks your base
and Tasha's base. Ever the
optimist, you can obtain a quick
HQ capture using an Artillery,
Anti-Air, Bike, and Rig if you
rush the plasma wall and her
base. A Tank or two for
assistance if you can't capture
the HQ effectively would be
advised. It's tricky to pull
off, and it takes a little
experimenting in positioning,
but can be done.

Going for rout the regular way
is tougher, as you'd expect.
Begin rushing for the nearby
neutral factory and cities, and
try heading for the center of
the map. This will eventually
result in a ground clash against
Tasha, who will begin focusing
most of her efforts into taking
the middle area. It'll be a
stalemate even if you capture
the cities, and packing several
Artillery is advised.

At this time you can continue
going for rout, or just capture
the HQ. Every few days, Tasha
leaves her HQ wide open. Get an
Artillery to destroy a meteor,
then rush in with a loaded Rig
and several Tanks or other weak
units to act is shields as an
Infantry attempts to capture the
HQ. If you do this method, make
sure Tasha is continually
building units from her eastern
factory. It'll make taking her
HQ easier. If you don't want to
do this, then try breaking the
stalemate. As advised, Rockets
will force Tasha to retreat her
stronger units, allowing you to
push further into her territory.

A simple looking predeploy

that nearby factory, but you can
ignore the radar tower. It's an
easy way to get some of your
units killed, and is advised
against. Put a Tank on the HQ
and put Gage inside when you can
so you can boost the strength of
your troops. Move an Infantry
over to the silo so you can fire
it when a bunch of enemy troops
come your way.

Keep the Artillery on the
southern already owned city, and
hide your units in forests.
Target the Tanks and Md Tank
first, then go for Mechs and the
Artillery if you can find it.
Rush the HQ and kill any units
that Lin retreats to heal. You
want to keep that Speed score
high, so don't let a single unit
delay you several days.

===================
~~T10-Blade Isles~~
===================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

You and your opponent are on
identical looking islands, but
you need to put your first turn
advantage to good use to succeed
here. Obvious enough, begin
rushing for properties. You need
a serious amount of funds to
produce and counter all the
different types of units. A
Battleship and a Bomber will
provide land assitance early on
if you save up funds. You can
seriously disrupt enemy
capturing by using them.

The computer rarely builds naval
units, but will build aerial
units now and again. It focuses
more on expensive grounds
troops. By exploiting how the
computer acts that way, you can
create more Anti-Tanks and
Bombers to neutralize those
units. If your using Bombers,
have some Fighters handy, and
keep Cruisers nearby when using
Battleships. You have to always
be able to counter their
weaknesses, and it's best to
make the computer waste funds on
strong counters for those units,
only for you to hopefully
destroy them just as quick as
they were made.

The problem with the map is that
there are no factories in the
middle-- just cities. You pretty
much have to have air support
with your ground troops in order
to clear this map. As you rush
the enemy base, you're far from
your own base, making it
difficult to provide additional
support. Be sure that you are
able to overwhelm the enemy
before doing so. If you're not
ready, blockade the upper island
with some meatshields with
Rockets behind them, then get
additional support. And no,
Bomber spamming is not going to
get you an easy victory.

====================
~~T11-Star Islands~~
====================
Time Limit--5 Days
CO--Penny
Enemy CO--Greyfield

This mission is insanely easy.
As you can tell just by looking
at the map, both HQ's are on
tiny islands with nothing
guarding them. The quick and
easy answer to this mission is
to capture Greyfield's HQ.
Luckily, he won't start
defending it actively until
around day 15, so you have some
time to work with.

There's Fog of War, so don't get
thrown off. Build an Infantry on
the first day and capture an
airport. Once you have the
airport, create a T Copter, and
afterwards begin moving towards
Greyfield's HQ so you can
capture it. Build a B Copter or
a Duster at the airport after
the T Copter leaves. On the
following day, make Penny board
the unit. You'll be needing the
extra power shortly.

Move that unit towards your HQ.
Greyfield has the same idea as
you--capture the HQ and end this
quickly. A powered up B Copter
or Duster can easily kill the
Infantry attempting the capture
around day 8. To boost your
Power score, kill the T Copter
first (you'll have time to kill
the Infantry on the next turn,
don't worry). By day 9 or 10 you
can easily have captured
Greyfield's HQ.

If you don't want to capture the
HQ for whatever reason, expect a
long battle. Secure the southern
island for more funds than
Greyfield, then bring out some
Cruisers to deal with the
Submarines and mass aerial units
he will be producing. Make a
Fighter or two as well to
counter those units, and make
Bombers when you're ready for an
assault on his base. You'll need
a Battleship or two as well to
destroy any Anti-Airs and
Missiles he creates. Luckily,
Penny negates the rainy weather,
but Greyfield still suffers. Use
it to your advantahe.

=====================
~~T12-Intricate Map~~
=====================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Tasha
Enemy CO--Greyfield

There's two ways to win this
map, as with most trial maps--an
easy HQ capture if you get
lucky, or a long and drawn out
brawl. For the easy HQ capture,
just build several Mechs and
send them over the mountain
range east towards Greyfield's
HQ. Keep joining Mechs because
they will be getting damaged. It
will take several days of
continued capture before you
finally finish. Of course, this
is assuming Greyfield doesn't
attack you with too many strong
units, so a little luck is
needed. Using three Mechs, and
luck that ONLY Infantry attack
your capturing Mech, it's a
quick and painfully obvious
victory.

The regular way is a bit harder.
Greyfield will conserve funds to
build a Battleship, and then
usually puts himself into that
Battleship if he has leftover
funding on the next turn.
Obviously, use some cheap Bikes
to capture like crazy, then make
a Submarine when possible. You
want to halt any naval unit that
Greyfield creates. Keep your
ground forces stable and try to
capture as much of the center
area of the map as possible, as
well as some cities down south.

Have Tasha board a Tank, or
another decent ground unit. Hold
the center and make a Battleship
to inflict harm on anything
Greyfield brings to the center.
He has only one factory, so it
works perfectly. If you are
going to use a Battleship, then
make a Cruiser as well to
counter the Submarines Greyfield
will be sending at you.

With a little work, you can push
through the somewhat weak
defensive wall that Greyfield
sets up. Once you push into his
main base, capturing any cities
Greyfield has, you can easily
overrun that one tiny factory.
Be sure to put something on his
ports first, though. You don't
want him producing Battleships
you can't kill quickly.

Infantry, 4 Mechs, Recon, Tank

A pretty simple predeployed map,
as it looks. The Mechs that the
computer has are the biggest
threats because they can rip
through your Tanks and Md Tank,
and you want to keep those alive
as long as possible. What you
want to do is hold the southern
chokepoints near where you
start. Position your Artillery
so it can attack anything from
the left or right side forces.

Have your Mechs act as bait for
the other Mechs, then have any
remaining Mechs damage/kill
them, or have your Infantry
help. Keep your Tanks away from
their Mechs. You want them alive
as long as possible. You will
need to work pretty fast to earn
an S Rank here because of the
low time limit. Try to focus on
one group of forces instead of
splitting up. Sacrifice several
Mechs to keep your other units
alive longer. The low movement
of Mechs will make them
worthless towards the end of the
battle anyways. Overall, a
pretty simple map.

======================
~~T14-Fragment Isles~~
======================
Time Limit--15 Days CO--Penny
Enemy CO's--Isabella, Lin,
Brenner

This is an insanely easy four
player map because of how stupid
the computer is. First off,
build a T Copter and an Infantry
at the southernmost factory.
Repeat this build again on day
2. Have the two T Copters and
Infantry head for the blue
team's airports on the southeast
corner of the map nearby. You
want to capture those airports,
rendering the blue team useless.
Make a Fighter to assist them in
case blue builds some air units,
which will disrupt your capture
attempt.

Once you have the blue team's
airports, you've won the
mission. I'm not kidding--you
take down one team's set of
airports, and this mission is
over. The computer, all of them
and not just the one without
airports, will constantly be
building Anti-Airs from their
factories. On those tiny
islands. Yeah. You want to hurry
and capture everyone's HQ. Once
the islands are full of Anti-
Airs, they will be forced to
build aerial units, and that'll
make things a bit more
difficult. Using a group of
three Bombers, putting Penny in
one of them, head to the island
with blue team's HQ. Target the
Anti-Airs first, then the units
on Factories, aiming to block
the factories.

Use a T Copter and drop an
Infantry to take their HQ, and
not only will you defeat the
blue team, but you get
possession of all their
properties. Now you should own
pretty much own half the map,
and meanwhile black and yellow
are busy fighting amongst
eachother.

All you have to do at this point
is have your Bomber squadron and
Infantry/ T Copter go from
island to island, capturing the
remaining two HQ's. Replace any
weakened/destroyed Bombers at
the nearby airports, and use
Penny's CO Power if you want to
if it manages to get fully
charged (which in a Bomber, is
likely to happen fast). Simple S
Rank, and the map is fun to play
against computers on. Because
they're so stupid.

===================
~~T15-Jay Islands~~
===================
Time Limit--30 Days CO--Gage
Enemy CO's--Greyfield, Waylon,
Tabitha

As with most four player maps,
this is just mean. Flat out
awful and mean. You're in for an
insanely long battle, but you
will need to work quickly in
order to avoid a stalemate.
Overrunning Greyfield is
critical because he's closest to
you. Fortunately, Waylon and
Tabitha will take care of
themselves, and shouldn't get
involved in your business until
you come near their territory.

Begin capturing properties and
start focusing on a navy. Get a
couple of Landers going, and
fill them with Tanks, and send
them over to Greyfield's island,
with Battleship and Cruiser
support. Have the Battleships
attack what Greyfield makes on
his factories to not only weaken
them, but waste his funds on
repairs. Park a Cruiser infront
of his port, and have a
Submarine destroy a Gunboat if
he feels like making one.

With a little effort, you can
destroy Greyfield. Try to
capture his HQ so you gain
control of all his properties.
With one player out of the way,
the map will be considerably
easier. You should have a total
of 28 properties under control
at that point, twice as much as
either of your competitors. With
two seperate bases, begin
planning to destroy Tabitha. The
problem with her is that if she
gets CO Power off, it will
likely attack your units instead
of Waylon's. Obviously, rushing
her base and neutralizing her CO
Unit before that happens is
advised, if at all possible.

Tabitha will likely be weakened
with the fight against Waylon,
so invading her base should
prove even easier, ignoring the
fact you should have a large
army and plenty of Landers to
ferry them, and Battleships not
far behind. There's not much
more to say than to repeat the
previous process against
Tabitha. Once she has been
destroyed either by rout or,
preferable, an HQ capture, then
Waylon is all you have left.
With no air force to help him,
three seprate islands against
his pathetic lonely one will
mean a sweet victory for you. I
can finish in 47 days, giving a
decent Speed score. See if you
can finish faster. Don't be too
defensive--stalling will not
help too much on this map.

CO--Lin

Enemy Units--5 Infantry, Mech, 3
Tanks, Md Tank, War Tank, Anti-
Tank

Destroy/injure the Infantry near
the middle of the map, and
capture the airport with a Mech.
Leave the meteors alone because
they will just slow down
Brenner. You want to take down
all these units pretty quickly,
and there's no 'truly' effective
way of doing it without
suffering losses.

Make B Copters whenever
possible. They are moderately
effective against the Tank units
that Brenner has, so they are
quite cost effecitve. Take down
the War Tank with an Artillery
attack and two B Copters. Then
focus on the Anti-Tank that is
likely to break down the meteor
right after the War Tank is
destroyed (do so before it
breaks down both meteors).
Sacrifice your Md Tank and a
Mech, and a B Copter to finish
the job, to take down the Anti-
Tank.

Once you take down the northern
units, the rest will be easy.
The southern Tanks will be
scared of your units, so use
your B Copters to easily take
them down. There's not much else
to say if you work quickly
enough. Don't build too many B
Copters to keep your Technique
high.

Enemy Units--4 Mechs, 2 Tanks, 2
Md Tanks, War Tank, 3 Artillery,
Anti-Air, 2 Rockets

Well, this is an insanely easy
predeploy mission. I mean,
really nothing to note here.
Basically, you want your Bombers
to destroy as much as possible,
then ferry over the Md Tanks and
an Infantry. You want to capture
the HQ to end the mission
quickly to obtain a somewhat
high Speed score because
finishing in 2 days is
impossible.

You want to destroy the Anti-Air
quickly. Use the Battleship to
do so, but keep it out of
indirect range and away from the
beaches where the enemy Tanks
can injure it. You can probably
finish by day 6 or 7 easily if
you use your Bombers effectively
and get lucky with enemy
placement so you can land your
Tanks and Infantry without them
getting damaged rather fast. As
mentioned, capturing the HQ is
probably faster than going for
rout, so just stall the weaker
units when your Bombers run out
of ammo.

==================
~~T18-Cat Island~~
==================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Tabitha
Enemy CO--Tasha

Again, as with most maps, a
quick HQ capture is insanely
easy. It doesn't require
anything difficult. Build an
Infantry from the southern
factory, move it on the next
turn and build a Rig. Make the
Infantry board the Rig and head
on over to the HQ. Meanwhile,
build a Tank to distract Tasha,
as well as providing points
towards Power (if you want you
can have Tabitha board the Tank,
but it's not necessary). Drop
the Infantry off at the HQ and
capture it with ease for a
victory.

Alternatively, you can go for
rout, which is obviously harder.
You'll want to capture the many
cities around the map as quickly
as possible, starting with the
ones already owned by Tasha. As
you move closer to the center of
the map, you will be needing
some defensive support to be
able to continue capturing. Make
a Recon or two on the side in
order to disrupt several of
Tasha's capturing attempts.

Unfortunately, those starting
factories are the only ones you
get on the map. To compensate,
put Tabitha in a Tank and build
her CO Meter. Once full, you'll
have an average CO Zone size
that gives the best boosts in
the game. Fair tradeoff I'd say.
With this, several Tanks can
easily overrun whatever Tasha
has currently guarding her base.
At that point, capture or block
her facotories and finish
routing her, or just capture her
HQ for a more real victory.

CO--Waylon
Enemy CO--Isabella

Starting Units--10 Infantry, 5
Landers, Bomber Enemy Units--14
Infantry, 5 Mechs, 2 Artillery,
3 Rockets, 2 Missiles

You're going to want an HQ
capture on this map due to how
annoying it is to rout Isabella,
not to mention slow. Your
Infantry are able to destroy a
decent amount of the enemy
forces, allowing your Bomber
squadron to push through. And by
that I mean two Bombers--one
with Waylon boarded, and the
other without.

Keep an Infantry held back at
the start. Once you have two
Bombers on the field, make a T
Copter. Your goal is to destroy
the two Missiles, possible
sacrificing a Bomber, and get
rid of the Rockets to the
Infantry can capture Isabella's
HQ uninterrupted.

This is made difficult by the
large amounts of Infantry and
Mech walls the computer will
form. Have your Infantry injure
and destroy as many as they can,
and have your Bombers move
around to a spot that the
Infantry/Mech wall isn't
covering, just outside of the
Missiles ranges. On the turn
after, rush in and destroy both
of them. Move your T Copter
accordingly. If the Rockets
aren't able to target the HQ, go
ahead and drop off the Infantry
there once you get the chance.
If they are able to target it,
naturally destroy those Rockets.

Do this quickly. After several
days, Isabella will have the
funds to build Anti-Airs, and
that will quickly diminish your
hopes of victory. This shouldn't
take more than 10 days, and
around that time Anti-Airs begin
being made, so you should be
able to achieve a simple and
effective victory here.

~~T20-Slime Cove~~
==================
Time Limit--5 Days
CO--Brenner
Enemy CO--Lin

Ugh. This map is infuriating,
and you'll want to finish it off
quickly. The Speed limit makes
no sense at all...it's like they
want you to rout them in the
first few days. I believe that's
possible, and with a little
luck, achievable.

Basically you send Anti-Airs,
one with Brenner in it for
additional power, and a Recon at
the end, over towards the enemy
base. If you're lucky, the
computer will only build Bikes
and Mechs during this, allowing
you to pick them all off with
the Anti-Airs. The Recon can
finish off whatever the Anti-
Airs couldn't originally kill,
if anything. Now, if this is
done right (and the computer
loves preventing it from doing
so), you'll win by rout. I've
done this once...

But often, the computer will
build a Battleship at the end
for whatever reason, making it
impossible at that point. So
going for a regular brawl may
just be the simplist of ideas
unless you want to try and get
VERY lucky. Basically, ignore
the cities near your factory and
rush for the middle. Build a
Recon or two to stall Lin's
capturing, and get some Tanks
out on the field to destroy any
heavier vehicles she sends at
you. You will also be needing
Submarines. Lin loves to save
her cash for a Battleship every
now and then, and it's best that
you have an effective counter
for them. Gunboats would also
work too, provided you have a
Rig on shore to resupply them.

Hold off in the middle and make
Rockets to push Lin's forces
back into her base, and make
some Battleships of your own for
naval support. Once you have a
strong economy going, you can
push through the chokepoint and
into her base, finishing off
anything that's left. Or, just
capture her HQ, which can be
difficult since the only shores
are on the opposite side of the
island her HQ is facing. Your
call.

Time Limit--7 Days
CO--Gage
Enemy CO--Forsythe

This is pretty easy. It will
take a short amount of time, but
this trial map is a nothing
compared to others. Basically,
you'll be needing to take all of
the cities around the central
factory, as well as that
airport. Keep making ground
units and B Copters every now
and then--you'll need to defend
this spot unitl you get a strong
enough army going. Forsythe
enjoys spending lots of cash on
Anti-Airs, even with only a few
B Copters on the field.

Your economy will quickly outdo
that of Forsythe's, so keep
aerial units coming out. Several
Bombers, with Tanks on the
ground, is going to be
effective. You will want four or
five Bombers, with two Fighters
(one Fighter or Bomber should
have Gage in it) rush Forsythe's
base while the ground troops use
the distraction to destroy any
and all Anti-Airs that Forsythe
has going.

Focus on the factories. Block
them with Bombers, then go for
the airports and try blocking
those with Fighters. If you can
block all four of these,
Forsythe is limited to his lone
factory up north, and by that
time your ground troops should
have pushed up to that spot.
He's likely making Anti-Airs
like crazy at that point from
that single factory, so block
the bridge if you can't destroy
the Anti-Air on the factory on
the turn it was made, so at the
least you stall his attempt to
destroy the units on his blocked
production facilities.

Have remaining Bombers attack
Anti-Airs hanging around his HQ,
and anything else you need to
build in order to rout what
little remains of his army at
the time of invasion.

Time Limit--25 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO's--None, None

This is the only three player
trial map, and for good reason.
It's not fun, but that can be
generalized about most
multiplayer trial maps. For this
one, it should appear obvious
that ground units aren't going
to get much usefulness here due
to the mountain ranges spread
out everywhere. That won't be
stopping Mech rushes, but the
computer won't do that. You WILL
be seeing enemy Infantry and
Mechs come over through the
mountains into your base on and
off during the battle, but
unless you were being totally
oblivious, they won't be a
threat.

Now, there's the capture
priorities. T Copters need to
transport your Infantry to
effective properties, and you
have to be able to defend them.
10 days into this map and it
will be littered with units.
There's an airport to the east,
and another south near a
factory. Get these first. Then,
send the T Copters back to the
base and have one with another
Infantry head north for some
cities, while the other goes to
the southwest corner and secure
the factory if possible. If the
computer beats you to it,
retreat and go for other
properties.

Blue will constantly be
assaulting you with air units.
Have a couple of Missiles and
Anti-Airs stationed at your
base, and have a Flare or two
shoot each turn to scout for any
enemies. Build a significant
aerial armada and go for the
yellow base. You want to capture
their HQ to earn all of their
properties. With a bunch of
Bombers and Fighters, this is
pretty easy. Just save and
reload until you find a path
that doesn't involve running
into a bunch of Anti-Airs on
your way there. A Duster or two
is also useful, as they can be
real aerial killers.

Once yellow has been taken down,
and their HQ hopefully captured,
this mission will have gotten
easier. If you took the HQ, you
can safely assume any unowned
property belongs to blue.
Knowing that, you can try to
destroy their economy before
going for a final assault. Send
Bombers, Fighters, and T Copters
toward their owned cities far
from their main base and capture
them to start disrupting their
economy. Once weakened, you
should make one final assault on
their base, destroying
everything. If you can't rout
them because some unit is hiding
possibly far away, just capture
the HQ.

It looks easy, but this map can
be extremely annoying. Blue
starts with more properties, so
they can Infantry/Bike rush you
better at the start, and most of
the map is covered in forests.
Here's an effective day by day
guide written by Swifty on the
Wars World News forums. Thanks
to him for allowing me to use
his guide:

Day 1-
Build two Infantries

Day 2-
Move both Infantries 3E

Day 3- Move east Infantry 3S and
start capturing the city Move
west Infantry 2S and start
capturing the city Build Rig at
northern factory

Day 4-
Finish capturing both cities
Move Rig 3E
Build Recon at northern factory

Day 5-
Move east Infantry 3N into Rig
Move loaded Rig 4E 1S
Move other Infantry 2E 1S
Move Recon 5E 1S
Build Recon at northern factory

Enemy Day 5- The enemy Bike
should take at least 2 HP of
damage in the counterattack from
when it attacks your Infantry

Day 6- Move Rig 3E 2S Move
wounded Infantry 2W 1N (don't
move it anymore) Save, then move
east Recon 4S and destroy the
Bike if possible Move other
Recon 5E 1S Build another Recon
at northern factory

Enemy Day 6- Enemy Recon should
attack your Recon

Day 7- Rig 1E 4S and drop
Infantry south Move first Recon
4E 1S Move second Recon 6E Move
last Recon 5E 1S

Enemy Day 7- Enemy Recon and an
Infantry should attack the first
Recon, leaving it at 1 HP

Day 8- Move Infantry 3S and
begin capturing HQ Move Rig 4S
1W Move first Recon 2E 4S Move
second Recon 5W 2N Move third
Recon 2S

Enemy Day 8- The Infantry
capturing the HQ should not be
attacked at all

Day 9-
Finish capturing the HQ

If you get lucky enough with
enemy movements, you will be
able to capture the enemy HQ.
Honestly, routing the enemy in
this map is annoyingly hard, and
once you push to the enemy HQ,
you'll be trying for an HQ
capture most likely anyways.
More likely then not, the enemy
will not do everything specified
here. Improvisions can be made
and still win on day 9.

Basically, you need to have the
Rig move 1W of the HQ capturing
Infantry and have a Recon be 1N
of it at the end to prevent an
enemy from harming the Infantry.
Have the other Recons try and
distract the enemy when going
for the capture. It's the best
(and only) improvision you're
able to easily make.

====================
~~T24-Wedding Ring~~
====================
Time Limit--10 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

The best way to finish this map
quickly is an HQ capture, and it
seems recommended by the fact
there's a mountain infront of
the HQ's. But getting that is
going to be a bit challenging.
First off, you'll want several
Infantry and a T Copter. Begin
capturing the enemy cities
infront of your HQ, and save up
for a Duster. Once you have a
Duster, start making your way
down to the enemy HQ, injuring
enemy T Copters on your way.

Doing so will distract the
enemy, focusing their efforts on
destroying your Duster and T
Copters. Build a Missiles or
Rockets back at your base
(Missiles to destroy a T Copter
before it can drop an Infantry
to capture your HQ, or a Rockets
to destroy the Infantry when it
lands). Use your Duster to
destroy an enemy B Copter, and
then drop your Infantry onto the
HQ, capturing it two turns later
provided no additional B
Copters/Dusters are flying
around the enemy base.

If you don't want to try
capturing the HQ, or are unable
to do so, then it's still not
too hard to finish this mission.
You'll want to capture all of
the center cities to turn the
map completely in your favor.
Two Infantries and T Copters are
what you need. Have a Duster
destroy any T Copters an
Infantry that try landing at the
center. Start making Bombers
once you have a large economy,
making a Fighter every now and
then to take down the weak
aerial units. Have the Bombers
rush for the factory and block
it, while the Fighters do the
same for the enemy airport. Once
blocked, rout can be easily
obtained.

CO--Tasha

Another annoying battle because
of how large the map is. At
least you've got airports to
cover your ground units. Thanks
to thefalman on the Wars World
News forums for letting me use
his brilliant day by day guide
for this map:

Day 1- Build Bikes at north and
east factory Build Infantry at
south and west factory

Day 2- Move east Bike 2S 2E and
start capturing the airport Move

factory Load Tasha into Fighter
and move Tasha 7N 2W Move west
Infantry 3W Move south Infantry

Will needs to build a Fighter

reload if it survives Load south
Infantry into T-Copter and move
T-Copter 6N Move Anti-Air 2E and
destroy enemy Infantry Move
north Bike 2S 1E Move west
Infantry 2N and start capturing
city Build a Duster at airport

Will Day 6- Will should build a
Duster near his HQ, and a Mech
at his Westernmost base. This
means he will only have enough
funds for a Fighter next turn.

Day 7- Save if the above
happened Destroy enemy Duster
with Tasha Move T-Copter 2N 4E
and drop Infantry north Move
Duster 7N Finish capturing city
Move north Bike away from enemy
units

Will Day 7- Will should build a
Fighter near his HQ.

Day 8- Save here Destroy enemy
Fighter with Tasha; reload if
it's left with 1HP Begin
capturing Will's HQ

Day 9-
Finish capturing Will's HQ

Most of the time this method
will work flawlessly. The main
thing that can go wrong is day
7. If Will won't make the
Fighter he will make Anti-Airs
instead. To make him build a
Fighter, try changing the
position of where you drop the
Infantry and where you move the
Duster. If Will continues to be
stubborn, restart the map and
try again. It may take several
tries, but I guarentee this
strategy works. Quite nicely,
really.

But if you absolutely can't get
this to work, then you're going
to need to go for rout the
regular way. You start with
fewer properties, but can grab
more than Will. Don't neglect
the base up north. Hold the
chokepoint up there with Rockets
and Bombers as you capture
southern properties. Make Anti-
Airs every now and then to
counter the air units that Will
will make from time to time.
Just keep outproducing Will and
push him back into his own
territory, then start capturing
his cities and factory in the
northwest.

Once you have the factory, the
final shove through Will's base
will become fairly simple. Keep
producing Tanks, with a Bomber
every now and then to force Will
into making Anti-Airs. Continue
the shove into his base and the
mission can end fairly quickly.
Not too hard given the property
advantage you can earn.

====================
~~T26-Bounty River~~
====================
Time Limit--15 Days
CO--Penny
Enemy CO--Isabella

Isabella starts with a property
advantage, but you are given
more neutral properties to
capture than she is. As is
obvious from the layout of the
map, you'll need to focus on a
navy far more than ground
troops. Focus on getting the
ports and cities on your side of
the map, and begin building a
navy. Start with Submarines and
Cruisers. Make Battleships not
long after once you have enough
properties to make them almost
every day.

From this point, the computer
gets to be very sporatic.
Sometimes it will focus on land
troops, and sometimes it goes
for mainly for naval units. Keep
building Submarines and
Battleships so you can batter
both forms of enemy troops.
Early in the mission you should
have been saving funds and not
spending them on worthless
units. With all those funds you
can start a powerful navy.

Get several Landers to transport
some ground troops to Isabella's
HQ. You want to block the
factories there and try to
capture her HQ, which is
considerably faster then routing
her. Use some Tanks south of her
HQ to keep any units down there
busy while going for the
capture. There shouldn't be much
north of her HQ, so just focus
on what is down south and stall
them until you finish the
capture.

Enemy CO's--Will, Penny, Tabitha

Starting Units--10 Mechs Enemy
Units--10 War Tanks/10 Mechs/10
War Tanks

This map needs to be completed
pretty quickly, so you'll need
to make effective use of your
Mechs and all of the silos
around the map. Black's War
Tanks will generally attack
yellow's Mechs, and blue attacks
you mainly. Launch silos at the
area around blue's HQ on the
first turn to injure as many War
Tanks as possible.

On the following turns, try
destroy or weakening as many War
Tanks as possible, then weaken
yellow's Mechs. You want to
eliminate blue as quickly as
possible, and try not to let too
many Mechs get weakened. You
need to actually be able to
finish 1 HP War Tanks before
they retreat to an HQ to be
healed. You certainly don't want
that happening.

Try to stay away from any
unowned cities to prevent the
enemies from seeing you,
especially yellow's cities. You
don't want a ton of silos being
aimed right at you. Try to get
your foes to merge units as much
as possible, draining their
turns and overall effectiveness
of their army. It is a short
map, but it's easy to mess up on
it, forcing you to start over.

Pretty simple predeploy map. It
should be fairly obvious that
you are going to want an HQ
capture finish on this mission.
6 War Tanks against your one
isn't a fair match. Luckily, if
you destroy the right meteors,
you won't have to face too many
of them. Start by destroying the
meteor north of where you start.
Destroy the Tank on the other
side once the meteor is
destroyed, then keep heading
north.

Destroy the northwest meteor so
you can access one of your
cities. Have your War Tank
resupply on it, and then destroy
the meteor that is east of your
city, and get ready for a Md
Tank and War Tank to attack you.
Try not to have your War Tank
lead, and instead have the Anti-
Tank do so. Take a few days to
destroy these two foes, then
destroy the meteor to the east
that the enemy Mech was
attacking earlier.

Make your way south, moving the
Bike near a meteor guarding the
HQ. Destroy it, then try to
block or destroy the War Tank
that will be freed from the
plasma while you attempt to take
the HQ. As long as the Bike
isn't destroyed, this should be
a fairly easy mission and S

This is a simple to beat Trial
Map, but S Ranking it is a pain
due to the odds of getting low
Power and Technique just so you
can overpower the units the
computer starts with. Bring an
Infantry and Recon to the north,
and the Tank east. Destroy the
Recon and capture the nearby
cities. You'll want to build two
additional Recons, followed by
two Tanks. The Recons will help
in destroying the Anti-Tank and
Rockets thanks to their
effectiveness against them, as
well as their movement.

The Tanks should proceed north.
Focus on the two Artillery
first, then go for the Rockets
while staying out of the Anti-
Tanks' range it'll never move
off of the HQ). Team up units to
destroy the Anti-Tank once
everything else has been
destroyed. Recons can do decent
damage against them, so save
your Tanks for finishing it off
after your Recons help with the
job.

It shouldn't take too much to
finish this map, but beating it
quickly and doing enough damage
for a high Power score is
important, as well as building
only a few units to keep the
Technique score as high as
possible.

~~T30-Destiny Ocean~~

Time Limit--10 Days
CO--Greyfield
Enemy CO--Lin

This can be a painfully annoying
map, but if you're lucky, you
can capture Lin's HQ with
minimal resistance. Start off by
making an Infantry and head east
to capture the blue city. Make a
Lander, then load the Infantry
into it, as well as a Tank with
Greyfield boarded onto it, and
head for Lin's HQ. If you are
lucky, Lin won't build anything
to counter you, and you can
easily capture Lin's HQ,
destroying the weak units in her
factory with the Greyfield Tank.

But that doesn't always work,
and relies on some luck. To beat
this mission the regular way,
get ready for a tedious naval
battle. You'll want to capture
the cities on the center island,
and keep Lin away from them.
Make some Battleships and
Submarines to keep the seas in
your control. Make Landers and
load them with Tanks and head
over to Lin's island. Block her
port with your Lander and unload
your units (destroy the unit on
the port if something is on it).

Have Battleships destroy
whatever units Lin has on land
near her factory, then rush your
Tanks over to it and park
something on it. With both
production facilities useless,
you can either capture her HQ or
continue routing her. The HQ
capture is probably faster, but
as usual, such a decision is up
to you.

Cruisers, 2 Submarines, 3
Battleships

This map is the only fun "real"
four player brawl. It looks
hard, and will be that way at
first, but once you get going
and have an advantage, you will
be unstoppable. From the start,
you need to destroy all of the
Bikes and Md Tanks Greyfield
sends at you. Build several
Anti-Tanks and Anti-Airs to take
out their respective units. Once
Greyfield's initial rush is
destroyed, begin capturing the
ports to the south.

Your main objective now is to
capture Greyfield's airport to
the east. Push over there with
an Anti-Tank, Rockets, Missiles,
and several Tanks, along with a
Rig and Infantry. Have the
Missiles annihilate anything on
the airport while you run to
capture it. Greyfield has tons
of forests around him, limiting
land movement. Build tons of
Bombers and several Fighters
once you have the airport.
Ignore the factory and what used
to be your cities to the south.
You'll reclaim them soon enough.

Don't worry much about Forsythe
or Caulder--both of them will be
weakening each other, so just
focus on Greyfield. Go for an HQ
capture instead of rout. You
earn all of Greyfield's
properties by doing so, and that
will pretty much guarentee
victory once you capture it.
Bomber and Fighter rushing his
airports and factories is key,
then use a T Copter to grab his
undefended HQ. With Greyfield
out of the way, Caulder will be
next.

Caulder barely defends his HQ,
so capturing it is obviously the
way to go. Amass your Bombers
and a T Copter with an Infantry,
then head for his base. Block
his factory and stay away from
his ports where he can build
Cruisers. Caulder's HQ will fall
fast if you can destroy the pity
amount of Anti-Airs he has
defending it.

All that's left is Forsythe, and
you should notice that he'll be
quite weak from Caulder
constantly pounding on him.
Refuel your Bombers, then make
the final assault on his base,
using Battleships with the
insane amount of funding you
should be earning. If Forsythe
actually won his fight against
Caulder, it still shouldn't be
any trouble for you to finish.
Just HQ capture if that's the
case. Block his factories and
destroy any nearby land forces
and end this long map.

For the western Infantry, have
them capture the radar and city.
They will be used to stall
Isabella as you go for the
missile silos on the eastern
edge of the map with your other
Infantries, as well as placing a
Mech on the silo up north.

Move your Mechs down south, and
place Infantries on the
mountains to spot all of the
enemy army. Launch silos at them
like crazy, and then pick off
whatever weak units you are
capable of killing on the same
turn. Be aware that Isabella
will join most of her units, and
retreat the rest to her HQ to
start healing them. You don't
want to allow her to do that.
Once you attack with silos, you
want to finish the job off as
quickly as possible.

There's not much else to say for
this map. If you conserve units
effectively, and use silos as
best as you can, then this map
shouldn't pose much of a

Another easy predeploy mission.
If you work fast, you shouldn't
even need the silos to the west.
What you want to do is move your
forces south, but putting an
Infantry on your HQ so you can
load Brenner into it on the next
day. Destroy the Infantry on the
east just below your starting
units, injure the Mech next to
it, and place the Artillery
above the western Infantry. This
setup will make it extremely
simple to win the mission.

Just be sure the Artillery and
Tank isn't ripped apart by
Mechs. If you can prevent that
from happening, this will be an
easy mission. Send the Tank over
to the HQ and destroy the Recon
that likes to sit ontop of it.
Launch the eastern silo at the
largest group of units you can
hit, and try to kill all of the
Infantry running across the
mountains to the other silos. If
they get them, you'll easily
lose the mission with too many
weak units.

Just work fast to clear the
mission. It should only take
several days, and with no
factories there's nothing too
challenging about it, so long as
you cause high percentages of
damage to earn a high Power
score.

~~T34-Web River~~

Time Limit--30 Days CO--Will
Enemy CO's--Isabella, Lin,
Brenner

This will be a long and annoying
fight. Kind of similar to Peril
Maze, but with even fewer
properties, and it's all ground
based. You want to capture the
properties on your side of the
map quickly. There are six
cities in the center of the map,
and at least one of them should
be captured by you. You want to
focus your efforts into
capturing Isabella's HQ. Not
only will that take her out,
obviously, but you also get her
properties, which is quite nice
for this map. You'll be wanting
them.

Capturing it is a bit difficult.
Don't worry about Lin or Brenner
--if you stay away from them,
they will brawl amongst
themselves. Focus a ground
assault against Isabella,
massing Infantries at your upper
bases. Send them across the
river near her HQ, hide in the
forests to avoid detection, then
try to capture her HQ. If you
are also attacking her ground
forces, this will work in your
favor either way. Either she
stops trying to stop your ground
assault against your forces and
destroys the Infantry,
effectively allowing you access
into her base anyways, or she
ignore the HQ capturing Infantry
and focuses on your forces, in
which case you'll win anyway.

It's all about batting her units
into submission and pushing her
back with indirects. Once her HQ
is yours, you can easily win
this map. Go for Brenner's HQ
next because it's closest to
your base of operations. His
battle with Lin, and Isabella
before you interfered, should
have worn him down a bit to the
point where an HQ capture is
easily achieved with several
rushing Infantry. Keep joining
them together to keep the one
that is doing the capturing
alive long enough to finish.

With Brenner over and done with,
all you have left is Lin. HQ
capture can be a bit tricky, so
just stick to your ground forces
if you're unable to succeed. You
can outproduce Lin 3:1, so
there's no chance that she can
survive an onslaught of Tanks
being produced from most
factories under your control. It
won't take much to break through
Lin's weak defensive line and
push into her base, ending this
fight once and for all.

====================
~~T35-Center River~~
====================
Time Limit--12 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

This is an insanely easy mission
thanks to how stupid the
computer is at defending their
HQ. Build a Rig at the southern
factory and an Infantry in the
other. Move the loaded Rig on a
southern route to the HQ, and on
day 3 drop the Infantry at a
spot where it can start
capturing the HQ on the next
turn. On day 4 begin doing so,
and put the Rig on the woods one
space north of the HQ to prevent
the enemy from attacking. Finish
capturing next turn.

If you aren't in the mood for an
easy victory, then you are going
to need to rush the center
island. Be sure to capture
blue's cities near your base
with Infantry, but rush Bikes
and Recons to the center for
their respective purposes. With
a huge income in comparison to
your enemy, pump out Tanks and
Anti-Tanks. You'll be needing
the latter to destroy some
stronger Md Tanks that they
occasionally produce.

With a huge income, and constant
production of Tanks, overruning
the enemy base shouldn't prove
to be an extreme ordeal. With a
little luck you should win
handily.

=====================
~~T36-Mountain Pass~~
=====================
Time Limit--3 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Mech, Bike, 2 Tanks, Md Tank, 2
Anti-Airs, Anti-Tank, Rockets, 2
Missiles, B Copter Enemy Units--
2 Infantry, 3 Tanks, 2 Md Tanks,
2 War Tanks, Anti-Air, 2 B
Copters, 3 Fighters, 2 Bombers

This is another simple predeploy
map. Send both Infantry and the
Mech over the mountains to the
enemy HQ, setting Missiles in
position so the Bombers
shouldn't come near them, and
the rest of your army up the
passage to the north. By doing
this, you will lure every enemy
to come to the north passage.
Don't stay out of range of the
enemy--as you approach the enemy
HQ, attack or at least come near
their units.

You need to keep them distracted
as long as possible so that none
of the enemies go back to the HQ
when you start capturing it. The
enemy units will likely move
back to the HQ when you start
the capture, but all of the
forests will prevent them from
reaching it in time. Just make
sure the Bombers are destroyed
by the time you get to the HQ,
otherwise you will have no
chance unless the computer acts
like a complete idiot.

====================
~~T37-Fire & Water~~
====================
Time Limit--8 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

Make an Infantry in your
northeast factory. Move it north
for a few days until it is
parallel with the enemy HQ, then
start heading towards it. Once
you reach it, capture it and the
map is over. Seriously, this is
fail-proof.

If you don't want to beat this
mission with a laughable eays
method, and want a real fight,
then you'll find this map
slightly difficult. Send
Infantry and Bikes to capture
all nearby cities, and don't
worry much about the island that
blue has a starting factory
with. Just keep it defended from
the large amount of Infantry
they spam from it towards your
island factory.

Also try to capture blue's
starting cities as they will do
with you. Make some Tanks and
head towards the eastern blue
factory. Overrun it and block
it, or block the unit on it with
several Tanks. With the only
useful factory blocked, you
should just take the HQ for
real. The island with blue's
other factory can only be
accessed with Infantry and
Mechs, and blue is stupid enough
to build Tanks and Anti-Airs on
it.

===================
~~T38-Whirl Peaks~~
===================
Time Limit--11 Days
CO--None
Enemy CO--None

This can be a fairly easy map to
finish. Get an Infantry inside a
Rig and head for the airport to
the west. Keep building
Infantry, sending them towards
the center of the map, and try
to secure those cities. You will
be wanting far more funding than
the computer, allowing you to
rush them easily.

Once you have the airport,
easily enough, mass Bombers and
go for blocking blue's lone
factory. Build a T Copter and
try to capture their HQ. You
will want to work quickly,
because once blue gets their own
airport, they will be capable of
destroying your Bombers. With
the factory blocked and any
destructive Anti-Airs destroyed,
you can easily take the HQ with
little threats. If you're afraid
the enemy airport will build
some Fighters, make Fighters and
Dusters or your own to take them
down. You just need to protect
the capturing Infantry long
enough to finish taking the HQ.

================================
      ~5.Free Battle Maps~
================================
Included in the game are over
100 additional maps that can be
played in Free Battle. I will
give general descriptions on the
map, but these are to be used
against human players more so
than the computer. They aren't
in the campaign, so the computer
can be VERY erratic in it's
movements. Also, you are able to
change the settings of the
computer, weather conditions,
day limit, starting funds, funds
earned per city, and can even
choose your own CO's.

I will give basic descriptions
of the map, and battle
strategies for each side of the
battlefield.

-----------------
~5A.Classic Maps~
-----------------
Classic Maps are maps you should
have seen in the War Room in
previous Advance Wars. Some of
them have been changed a bit,
whether it's slight property
changes or additional/reduced
predeploys. These can be picked
for online random matches.

===============
~~Bean Island~~
===============
The northern cities looks to be
a common goal, but you should
only aim for the two closest to
you. Use Recons, or better yet,
Flares to mess up enemy
capturing. If you can stall the
economic growth long enough, you
can be at an early advantage.

Get a Tank out and put your CO
into it. Investing in a Rockets
is highly advised. Putting one
near the center will easily
scare a player into stalling for
time while they try to counter
it, usually with another
Rockets. If you're on the
recieving end of a Rockets, then
don't waste time. You can make a
Rockets, but when you do, the
other player will probably have
two of them, and that's deadly.
If they make a Rockets, go all
out and attack them.

Indirects can easily rule this
map, so make them a priority
along with CO Units. During the
frey, send Mechs over the
southern mountains and capture
the enemy cities. Repeat the
process for whatever the enemy
captured up north. With a
dismantled economy, the battle
will quickly end for whoever
falters slightly.

===============
~~Crater Isle~~
===============
This is the first of the maps
that'll make you go "...what
were they thinking!?" Simply
put, this map is almost
impossible for blue to win. They
can win if they work fast, and
red is a good sport and let's
blue have a chance.

Red starts with 11 properties,
and blue gets 4. All red needs
to do to win is send waves of
Tanks down the the blue
properties, both west and east.
East gets there quicker, but
west prevents any real expansion
for blue. Also, there's the fact
that blue is able to earn 14
total properties, if they're
lucky. Red can obtain 17, so
even if blue can get up to par,
it still isn't likely they can
overcome red.

Blue simply needs to play
defensively at first, and hope
for a miracle. Capture the
factories first, and only build
Infantry. Try to conserve money
as much as possible. Build
Recons to stall red's expansion
as long as possible. The longer
they take to max out their
economy, the longer you have to
attempt at catching up.

Red should make some Recons,
followed by Tanks. If red ends
up doing this, blue needs to
make Anti-Tanks and Tanks
themselves. Anti-Tanks are
better, especially putting them
on an owned city near the
chokepoints to the west. They'll
take minimal damage, and then
heal it the turn after. Overall,
even if a complete noob is
controlling red, blue stands
little chance of winning this
map, unfortunately.

=============
~~Triangles~~
=============
Yet another map where red has
the advantage. Obviously, you'll
be needing aerial units to
attack the enemy, and there are
plenty of properties to create
them, but the red side gets
three additional factories. That
means they can mass produce
Anti-Airs like crazy, and the
blue faction can't get far on
the red island.

If there's no fog, then blue has
no chance of winning. Although,
this map usually results in a
stalemate anyways. Fighters and
Anti-Airs, even if your using
blue, is going to keep your
opponent at bay. Basically, if
you mass an armada, and then
attack the enemy, you'll inflict
some casualties, but your entire
force is going to be destroyed
unless your foe didn't make a
decent amount of Anti-Airs.

I can't advise anything specific
for this map. No decent player
should realistically lose, but
blue might if red rushes early
before blue can create strong
air defense. Otherwise, it'll
likely end in a tie because both
islands have the same amount of
properties. Attempting to
disrupt enemy economy by
capturing their properties with
T Copters is the best option to
try and win, but that would
require distracting the enemy
with huge sacrifices in an air
raid, which likely won't work to
begin with.

================
~~Ball Islands~~
================
The map starts even from both
sides, yet blue is still at a
disadvantage. They have two less
properties to earn on their
island then red, but they can
generally reach theirs sooner,
allowing for a temporary higher
economy. Both sides should focus
on capturing the center islands
before their own island
properties. T Copters are fast
and cheap, so use those.

The temporary airports are
almost worthless, and should
only be captured later in the
battle when you have a
signigicant air armada. The
northern and southern islands
will likely be captured by blue
first, and the center island can
easily be captured by red. This
makes the property equal,
allowing a more fair fight.
Realistically, the better
commander will win as the
islands properties in the center
areas of the map will be the
tipping point. Whoever captures
them to have a economic
advantage will probably win.

Build Cruisers and Fighters to
keep enemy air units at bay, and
put Missiles at your island's
edges. As long as enemy air
units can get too far into your
base, this will become more of a
naval battle. Build a good mix
of units, and use Battleships to
batter the enemy Anti-Air
defenses. A frontal assault is
generally suicidal, so try
attacking from the back of the
enemy base. On a map like this,
long stalemates are likely.

================
~~Coral Lagoon~~
================
It may seem unfair that blue
technically has the large
amounts of properties closer to
them, but red has first turn
advantage to somewhat counter
this. Obviously, those
properties are the major
battlegrounds over a fight on
this map. You want control over
all of those properties to
ensure a victory, but kicking
your foe out is a different
story.

Red should be able to control
the properties, if they play
right, 4-2 in the north.
Luckily, blue gets one more
neutral city near their base.
After the initial rush of the
map, it's the same old same old.
Pump out Tanks and put your CO
in one of them, and try to
charge the CO Meter for a CO
Zone advantage. Several
Artillery will also prove to be
extremely useful if you are
capable of defending them, and
with how crazy the center will
become, this shouldn't be too
hard to manage.

Eventually, you'll need to win,
and that required making a move
to attack the enemy, who is
likely in your range constantly.
Be sure that you can overtake
their units in one fell swoop,
and try leading the charge with
your CO Unit. Basically, nothing
else new for the rest of the
map. Overtake enemy cities to
make them unable to counter your
oncoming rush.

===============
~~Puzzle Trio~~
===============
This is yet another stupid map,
this time giving blue the
blatant advantage. Red needs to
get over to the island and
capture all the properties on
their side to even out the map.
Blue's goal is to prevent this,
then take the properties for
themselves, easily winning the
map in the process.

You have a navy to work with as
well as aerial units, so try to
even out your focus between both
fronts. Send units, including
land ones with Landers, to the
center island. Each side needs
to push through and grab the
cities of the opposing team. The
ones who work the fastest will
easily succeed in doing this.
Aerial units are the way to go,
but just make sure you can take
out Cruisers as you won't want
to spend too much time on land.
Battleships are also effective,
just make sure to take out any
Submarines you're aware are
coming.

==================
~~Fist Peninsula~~
==================
Yeah, no point of tips here.
It's flat out impossible for red
to win this map. Honestly, what
were they thinking? Blue has 13
buildings, and red has
4. Not even close to a fair
   fight. And even if red
   manages to capture all
of the nearby neutral
properties, they'd have 15
properties. Sure, it's more, but
there's no chance the blue
player is going to be stupid
enough to let you do that.

For any decent fight, red should
try and, obviously, capture
those properties. Stay away from
blue's units and meatshield
until you capture all you can.
For blue, just rush them with
Tanks, capturing several
buildings along the way. Really,
making a Tank and Bike each day
will destroy what little hope
red has of winning this map.

===============
~~Brace Range~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Artillery, Rockets, War
Tank, Rig, B Copter

In this predeploy map, you'll
want to rout your foe instead of
an HQ capture. Mostly because
it's highly likely your Infantyr
and Mech will get destroyed, as
well as no smart player would
let their HQ get captured that
easily.

Basically what you want to do is
destroy the enemy B Copter and
Anti-Air, then erect a temporary
airport to heal any damage your
B Copter takes. Weaken the War
Tank, then invade with your
forces. Watch out for enemy
Artillery and Rockets, but other
then those nothing is a huge
threat. Heck, with no Anti-Air,
you can actually capture the HQ
with ease. Your call. Destroying
that Anti-Air can be tricky, so
using your Rockets to scare it
back is also a choice.

===============
~~River Range~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, 2
Mechs, Recon, Anti-Air,
Artillery, 2 Tanks, Rockets, Rig

In this predeployed map, red has
the clear advantage. Board the
Rig with a Mech, then rush for
the silo. Red will always get
there first ahead of blue.
Blargh. Both sides should keep
their Rockets near the mountain
range. That way they can batter
units, as well as destroy
Infantry crossing the mountains
in hope of capturing the HQ.

In Fog of War, the silo isn't as
useful. Blue should spread their
units out and wait for red to
attack. Stay away from the
mountains so enemy Infantry
can't see your units if they
stay in the mountains. Use basic
strategies for this map to wipe
out the enemy, and don't be
afraid to retreat for repairs.
It can mean the difference
between success and failure.
Putting a unit, like the Tank,
on your HQ is also advised to
let your CO board it.

=============
~~Moon Isle~~
=============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, War Tank, Artillery,
Rockets, Missiles, Lander,
Cruiser, Submarine, Battleship,
T Copter, 2 B Copters

Rather simple to work with
predeploy mission. The main
threats are the enemy
Battleship, Cruiser, Missiles,
and B Copter. Transport your
Missiles and Rockets to the
center island when the coast is
clear. You want to destroy, or
at least weaken, the enemy
Battleship. Try to destroy it
following its weakening, though,
because a temporary port can
repair it.

If you can hold control of the
center island, you can blast
away all the remaining units. Be
sure to keep your Battleship and
Cruiser alive as long as
possible, and destroy all of the
air units. With the seas and air
at your control, victory is a
guarentee. Just play cat and
mouse with your enemy to destroy
their units if necessary.

================
~~Mint Plateau~~
================
Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, Recon, 2 Artillery,
2 Tanks, War Tank, Rockets,
Anti-Air, Rig

There isn't much to this small
predeploy map. You should be
worried about the indirects that
the enemy has. Try to block the
chokepoints as best as possible
with your indirects, leading
with your Tanks on both ends.
What you want to do is wait for
the enemy to put their units on
the outer edge of your indirect
lines, then slowly march
forward.

Send an Artillery south so you
have some support. Don't be
afraid of sacrificing some units
either--you'll have to either
place them to lure out enemy
units, or the enemy will ignore
them and you can probably run
right up to their units and
attack, ignoring the
consequences of the nearby
indirects. That's the price to
pay, but whoever gets the first
strike will have the advantage.
If you get attacked first,
retreat further in the
chokepoints and try to delay
your enemy.

===============
~~Jewel Canal~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, 2
Mechs, Recon, Anti-Air,
Artillery, Tank, War Tank,
Rockets, Missiles, Rig,
Submarine, Cruiser, Battleship,
2 B Copters, T Copter, Bomber,
Fighter

The easiest way to win this map
is to capture the enemy HQ.
You'll need to destroy the enemy
Battleship to do this, of
course, so try to lure out the
Battleship and Cruiser. Be sure
to not get sunk by the enemy
Submarine. Once the coast is
clear, get a T Copter with an
Infantry up there and secure the
HQ, defending it from aerial
attacks with your Fighter.

If you'replaying with a smart
player, that HQ capture isn't
going to be very likely. Nothing
on the naval front is likely to
get accomplished, either. Move
your ground forces with your
Missiles constantly surrounded,
but placed so that if any aerial
unit attacks your group, it will
be killed with the Missiles.

Also, even if you can't capture
the enemy HQ, at least getting
the silo will be worth your
time. Anything you can do to
weaken the enemy units,
especially if they bunch
themselves in large groups as I
suggested, is going to work in
your favor. Play aggressively a
bit and you should be able to
overcome your foe.

=================
~~Wrench Island~~
=================
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Artillery, Tank, War
Tank, Anti-Air, Rockets, Rig,
Lander, Submarine, Battleship

An HQ capture is something you
should be wary about from your
enemy. As such, you'll want to
rush the enemy, but you don't
want to be going too fast that
you end up killing all of your
troops. Move the ground troops
along the beaches on the north
and south ends of the giant
wrench.

Your lone naval units should
simply take it slow. You want to
eliminate the enemy Battleship
naturally, but the enemy
Submarine may get in your way.
What you should do to keep
moving your Battleship around,
making the enemy Submarine waste
gas like crazy, especially since
it's submerged. Once it's sunk,
the enemy Battleship should
follow suit. Refuel with your
Rig, then take it down.

Be careful of the enemy Rockets
and Artillery, too. The War
Tank, as like most, isn't too
much of a threat. Take down the
indirects, and you can probably
wipe out your foe with an HQ
capture provided that your
Infantries haven't been killed
off.

===============
~~Rapid Ferry~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, Anti-Air, Missiles,
Rig, Lander, Cruiser, Submarine,
Battleship, T Copter, 2 B
Copters, Bomber, Fighter

You'll want to capture the HQ
for an easy victory, but your
foe isn't likely to let that
happen. Securing the center
island by putting your Missiles
on it is advised, but not until
the enemy Battleship is
destroyed. You may need to
sacrifice your own Battleship in
order to do so, but the effort
will likely pay off if you play
well.

Keep your Cruiser handy so that
you can destroy the enemy
Submarine, and naturally, all of
the aerial units that have to
come across the sea. Try to kill
the Bomber first, followed by
the B Copter. Get your Missiles
on the center island to help
out. With no naval or air force,
grabbing the HQ should prove
fairly simple. Whoever loses all
their naval and aerial units
will have essentially lost the
battle.

===============
~~Bundle City~~
===============
Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Recon, Artillery, Tank,
Anti-Air, Rockets, B Copter

Don't worry much about the
cities--your foe probably won't
let you repair your units if
they are smart. Red is capable
of getting both silos before
blue can, assuming they don't
defend either with a Tank or
Anti-Air. Killing off those
Infantry and getting the silos
is advised, so make sure they
get killed. Defend the silos
yourself if you can, then use
them and blast away the Tank,
Anti-Air, and/or B Copter.

The Artillery shouldn't be too
much of a threat as it has to
keep moving around, and with no
chokepoints and few meatshields,
there's no point in using it.
Use it as bait if you must,
mainly because there's nothing
you can really do with it
effectively. Past this, just try
and chase your foes around the
map, possibly going for HQ
capture if ever available.
Needless to say, this is FAR
more interesting in Fog of War.

===============
~~Scarab Road~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, 2
Mechs, Recon, 2 Tanks, War Tank,
Anti-Air, 2 Artillery, Rockets,
Rig, Submarine

Your forces start off on two
different islands. The point of
the Submarines is only for Fog
of War, so ignore it in clear
weather. Red has a clear and
flagrant advantage in this map.
They can rush blue's HQ,
blocking the capturing Infantry
with several meatshields until
they finish, easily winning the
map. Blue will want to stop this
quickly, so move their Artillery
to where it can attack anything
on their HQ. Red should do this
too, forcing a drawn out match.

Try to destroy the enemy Tanks
and War Tank first. Try to lure
them to a chokepoint, then blast
at them. Of course, the center
island is the best place to
accomplish this, and only use a
few units. Send the rest around
the map and seek out seperate
targets. HQ capture will always
be the best method to finish
this map, and it's only a matter
of destroying anything that can
destroy your Infantry trying the
capture.

Focus on enemy indirects next.
With no way of competing in
chokepoints, a victory will fall
easily into your hands. However
loses their Tanks first is
generally going to lose the
match. Ignore capturing cities
unless you are in critical need
of repairs.

==================
~~Pointing River~~
==================
Red Starting Units--Infantry,
Mech, Recon, Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Anti-Air, Rockets,
Missiles, Rig, Lander,
Battleship, Cruiser Blue
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Tank, War Tank,
Artillery, Rockets, Rig,
Submarine, T Copter, 2 B
Copters, Bomber

Both groups will need to rush
for the southern island to
secure a silo. Ground troops
will want to rush for the
bridge, and the aerial units
will need to do their best to
injure/destroy any of the ground
units, starting with the ones
that were injured by the silo if
you were capable of getting to
one. Use your Bomber to destroy
the enemy Anti-Air. Red needs to
get rid of blue's aerial units
to have an even advantage. Blue
will have to destroy the enemy
Battleship to make the map fair
right back, but beware of their
Cruiser!

Red will probably be able to win
the ground battle, so blue needs
to everything possible to get
rid of the Battleship and keep
their aerial units alive.
Whichever team is capable of
keeping their heavily
advantageous units alive the
longest will have a higher
likelihood of winning.
Naturally, with no air counters,
red can't win; with no sea
counters, blue can't win. Play
carefully.

===============
~~Liason Wood~~
===============
Starting Units--2 Infantry, 2
Mechs, Bike, Recon, 2 Tanks, War
Tank, Artillery, Anti-Air,
Rockets, 2 Rigs

The are tons of woods tiles on
this map, so most of your units
are going to be slowed down.
Keep a Tank on your HQ and wait
a few turns so you can put your
CO inside. It'll help with the
front lines.

With a CO unit helping your
other units during the main
attack, move your units into the
forests. In Fog of War, this is
a far more strategic move. In
clear weather, the map will
likely end in a stalemate. Keep
indirects in woods at all times.
Use your Recon and Rigs to scout
for units that are hiding, then
blast away at them.

The turning point of this map is
whoever gets the first strike.
You'll need to get lucky that
your foe doesn't spot you, and
that you find where their units
are generally hiding. If you
can't run into them, you'll
probably push through to their
HQ. That'll allow you to quickly
capture it. What will you do?
Keep a unit behind to prevent
capture briefly or go all out
through the forests? Judge your
opponent well and try to perform
the opposite of what they do.

===============
~~Deer Harbor~~
===============
This large map will be home to a
long battle. Blue will want to
go for the western island, as
they are closer to it, and red
will want to secure several
southern properties and
everything they can to the east.
The east has mostly cities and
plains, but a lone temporary
airport as well. If you can keep
that defended, you will have an
easier time holding off blue's
forces on the east side of the
map until you can assist with
ground troops.

Both teams should get navies
going, and you'll likely find
this will be more of a naval
battle. With NO production
facilities on the southern
island, or anywhere on the east,
a navy is realistically the only
option for both sides. Try not
to use too many Battleships.
Submarines should be fairly
common on both sides, and that
won't make them too useful.

This doesn't mean neglect your
ground forces. You'll want to
keep fighting on that front in
order to keep a stable economy.
Blue and red will constantly be
fighting for monetary control,
so try not to let up. Use aerial
units sparingly, enough to pose
a threat and cause Anti-Airs to
be built, but just don't rely on
them too much.

Not much else to say but take
your time. Build an army and
charge through your foe. There's
nowhere to hide in Fog of War.
Whoever can lead a ground
assault into their foes' base,
and have naval units supporting
them nearby, will win this
battle.

===============
~~Alara Range~~
===============
With so many mountains, ground
troops are going to have a
difficult time reaching
destinations quickly. Use T
Copters to transport Infantry
quickly across the map. The
temporary airports will prove
useful later in the battle when
dogfights will constantly be
going on.

The map is symmetrical in terms
of cities, so both teams have a
fair advantage. Don't invest too
much in T Copters. Three of them
will be enough to constantly
ferry Infantry across the map.
Be sure you can eventually
defend your frontal cities from
enemy Infantry--there's nothing
sillier than letting your cities
get captured.

Dusters will be high effective
in countering the aerial units
that your foe makes. Have your
CO board the Duster and it'll be
quite difficult to destroy
(especially if it's Waylon
inside). Past the opening
capturing, you'll want to flood
the center with Dusters, maybe a
Fighter or two, Anti-Airs, and
tons of Tanks with Artillery
support. Keep enemy Bombers at
bay, and as for yourself, never
make them. They will get
destroyed quite quickly against
a decent opponent, and the
damage they'll cause before
getting crushed won't justify
their cost.

Keep destroying your foes'
units, and push them back with
Rockets when you have the
chance. Stay defensive against
aerial units, and perhaps invest
in several Missiles in order to
assist you. With how long it'll
take them to reach the center of
the map, ensure they don't get
killed quickly. Take your time
with your army, then attack when
you feel ready and there's a
break in enemy movement.

==============
~~Lost River~~
==============
Blue will easily have the
advantage for this map. They
start with more properties, and
the cities up north are more
than easily accessable to them.
They can also get a second
airport more than easily near
the start of the match. All they
need to do is make a Duster to
prevent large red monetary
expansion. Red should attempt to
do the same, or at least counter
the Duster that blue is likely
to make.

Blue is likely to win in the
long run because ground forces
can't cross the entire map. Blue
gets access to a large economy,
and they have two airports, so
they are at the advantage. Just
spam strong Bombers to take out
Anti-Airs and Missiles that red
makes, and airlift Infantry to
try and take the HQ if you can
manage to block all of their
properties.

Red just needs to defend against
blue, and has to capture more
properties than they can. Keep
building from your airport. You
want to try and outproduce blue
as best as possible, countering
their units and trying to push
into their base at the same
time. It's difficult, but if you
have a stronger economy, you can
win.

================
~~Volcano Isle~~
================
Red easily has the advantage on
this map. They have access to
more cities, and getting to
those in the southwest corner is
far simpler to them. Blue may
get an extra factory, but if
they don't work fast, then red
will quickly stomp all over
them.

Don't try Mech rushing over the
mountains--you know no decent
player is going to let that
work. Have your CO board a Tank,
get several Bikes out, and begin
capturing while mounting an
offensive. Blue should try to
attack red from the north. They
have a factory up there, but red
doesn't. Use the many forests to
your advantage. Rush the south
and try to capture the
properties. At the least,
prevent your opponent from
getting them.

Once into the battle, Tanks and
B Copters are the best way to
go. Keep B Copters in wooded
areas where Anti-Airs get slown
down. Keep making Tanks or B
Copters each day, and do your
best to counter what your foe is
making, or at least what you
think they are making.

================
~~Turtle Atoll~~
================
Blue starts with the advantage,
and they get more neutral cities
to capture on their island as
opposed to red. For red to be
able to make it even, they will
need to capture the properties
on the smaller nearby islands.
Use Gunboats to get there
quickly, and try to outbeat blue
who will likely have the same
idea.

Other than that, this map will
be mostly a naval battle.
Battleships will be quite useful
here as the entire mainland of
both islands is available for
pelting. Place temporary ports
on the islands that you capture
so that Battleships can get
refueled and supplied. Red has
two ports, so they can seriously
injure whatever comes out of
blue's port and outproduce them.
Spending on Gunboats is advised
--by now you should know how
useful they can be in the seas.

If you do that, you REALLY need
temporary ports. You'll probably
get one of those smaller
islands, so keep the ammo of all
your ships in your mind when
making assaults.

=================
~~Squash Island~~
=================
Red is able to get an extra
factory quite quickly, but blue
is able to reach their
properties faster than red, so
it all evens out. This is a
pretty basic and fair match for
both sides. There's aerial
combat, as well as temporary
airports available for capture
in the center of the map. If you
can grab hold of those and keep
your planes alive, you will be
in pretty good shape.

As with most aerial maps, try to
focus more on your ground units.
You aren't getting an insane
economy, so wasting it all on
Bombers and Fighters is moot.
The center chokepoint is
something red will need to push
through quickly. Blue gets more
capturable properties on their
side, and if red rushes from the
start, they can get some of
those. Blue needs to halt their
advance any way possible.

At the center of the map, there
should be at least one Missiles
on both sides to keep aerial
units away, and plenty of
Artillery and Rockets. Whoever
has the better indirects is
going to get control of the
chokepoint, and the person who
pushes through is eaisly going
to be claiming victory. Keep
backing up your defense and slow
down your foes to buy time--
you'll be wanting as big an army
as possible.

=============
~~Cube Keys~~
=============
This map is massive, and it will
take a while to get an effective
army and economy going. Many
properties are far away from
your starting base, and
protected by mountains none
less, so send some Infantry
towards them and don't forget to
move them on the oncoming days.
For the remaining cities, using
T Copters is preferred thanks to
how far away they are. Don't
spend too much on transports.

After about 10-15 days, each
side should have a decent
economy, and so you should start
thinking about an army. It
should be obvious that this map
has tons of chokepoints, so use
that to your advantage.
Artillery and Rockets will have
a field day on this map, but
always keep Missiles nearby.
With airports at hand for both
bases, this map could turn more
into an aerial battle.

With little use for Anti-Airs
thanks to all the ocean spots
planes can park themselves on,
Fighters and Dusters will be
needed to keep enemy air units
away from your army and base.
Don't spend too much on them,
naturally. One or two Dusters
will be enough. You may want to
put your CO in a Duster, or
maybe a Tank, depending on which
front you want to put more
attention into. I prefer
assaulting on the ground with a
little air support, but the
other way around also works.
Manuavering around enemy
chokepoints is the best you can
do on your trip to raid the
enemy base.

==================
~~Mirror Islands~~
==================
This map tips the advantage far
to blue. So much so that red
hardly has a chance of winning
if blue prevents most capturing
that red does. Red will need to
try and capture the scattered
properties, while at the same
time destroying blue's attempts
at halting them.

Past that, it's an even map
mostly in terms of how many
cities there are. There are a
decent amount of plains and
roads leading to the center of
the map, so you'll want focus on
your ground units a bit more
than your aerial units. Make
Dusters occasionally in order to
hamper your foe's air units.

There are two bridges seperating
the islands, one in the north,
and another in the south. It's
best to attack whichever bridge
has the least amount of
resistance on it. That way you
can push through to the enemy
base quicker, possibly obtaining
several of their cities.
Obviously, prevent this by
evening defenses on both bridges
to stop oncoming enemies. You
have to keep your cities intact.

================
~~Shark Strait~~
================
Blue Starting Units--6 Infantry,
4 War Tanks, 4 Rockets, 2 Rigs,
2 Bombers, 2 Fighters

This is another huge map, and
blue has the blatant advantage.
They may start with one less
property, but they can
immediately capture a lot more,
and with their starting units,
stop red's capturing process.
Red's island houses a lot more
cities than blue can obtain,
even with the other two tiny
islands. The problem is trying
to capture all of them. It will
take time, and blue isn't going
to just let you capture them.

In Fog of War, red can capture
easily without too much
distraction. Start capturing to
the north, and focus on
destroying enemy War Tanks and
Rockets. Get some Anti-Tanks and
Anti-Airs out. The Bombers can
be a threat to the Anti-Tank,
but the War Tanks will easily
stay away from you if they know
what's good for them.

All this map involves is red
holding off blue until they get
a strong economy going. If red
captures everything on their
island, blue will have no chance
of winning due to red's far
superior economy. The whole
match can be determined by the
predeploys. If red can be halted
from capturing, blue will
probably win. If not, red will
win. It's as simple as that.

=================
~~Royal Channel~~
=================
Red Starting Units--5 Infantry,
2 Artillery, 4 War Tanks, 2
Landers, 3 Battleships, Cruiser,
2 Fighters, 2 Bombers

This map is insanely stupid. A
smart red player should make it
almost impossible for blue to
not get anywhere. With Bombers
and Battleships invading their
base on the first turn, they can
either may Submarines which
should get torn apart by red's
Cruiser, or make Fighters and
Dusters, which get torn apart by
red's Fighters.

Whatever way you look at it,
blue has little chance of
winning. If they spam Anti-Airs
the first few turns, they can
stop the Bombers, and then make
Submarines to take care of the
Battleships. However, once they
do this, red will have likely
captured a ton of properties, so
there will be a huge economic
disadvantage.

What's worse is that the map is
big. Too big. It will take days
for several units from either
army to collide and fight, and
many units are likely to run out
of fuel. When it comes down to
it, this is a boring map that
gives favor to red for whatever
reason. Blue can win, but it
will be an insanely long and
uphill battle for them. Try
taking red's cities first to
weaken their economy slightly,
then take care of their
predeploys.

------------------
~5B.2 Player Maps~
------------------
There are 70 of these maps, so
descriptions are going to be
pretty brief. Most of these maps
don't really need much mention.
However, unlike classic, a lot
of them are actually fair. These
can also be picked for random
matches online.

=================
~~Plug Mountain~~
=================
Spam Bikes throughout the
beginning days of this map to
either capture one of the
cities, and/or prevent your foe
from getting the other. From
there, you'll either be making
Mechs or Tanks every other day.
It's a tiny map, so overpowering
your foe shouldn't take too much
effort. If you want to, you can
make an Anti-Air to dispose of
the Bikes or Infantry your
opponent spams. It's quite
effective. Just have a Tank
assist it so an enemy Tank
doesn't destroy the Anti-Air you
invest--it's a low income map,
after all.

================
~~Basin Forest~~
================
Make Bikes to secure one of the
cities up north, and back them
up with Recons to halt enemy
advancement. Meanwhile, send
Mechs across the mountains to
capture the cities surrounded by
forests. Spamming several Mechs
that way will allow you to
control both cities. Whoever
ends up with more cities will
have a better advantage on this
map (not to mention blue starts
with an additional city).

Several Tanks can overrun the
enemy early on. Artillery
support is also highly advised
thanks to the chokepoints you
will likely make with a Tank
wall. Bust through some Bikes
and any enemy Tanks, capture any
of their cities you pass, then
push through their lone factory.
Should be a quick map for one of
the players. A long stalemate
isn't likely.

==============
~~Dual River~~
==============
Build Bikes and take over the
enemy cities. Even by doing
this, blue will still have an
economy advantage, so fighting
over an additional city will be
highly necessary for one of the
players. Of course, 1000G in
funds each turn isn't too much
in the long run.

Basically, just alternate
between Artillery and Tanks.
This map has good chokepoint
availability, so use them to
your advantage either in
defending or in attacking. The
map is small, so it shouldn't be
too long of a battle. Use Tanks
and Artillery as best as you
can, put your CO into a unit,
and push through the enemy.

===============
~~Cross Paths~~
===============
Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Artillery, Tank

This map is far more fun if it
is done in Fog of War. Red will
be able to win by HQ capture
since they can reach blue's HQ
first (obviously with first turn
advantage). Blue will need to
destroy red's Infantry, and at
that point, go for HQ capture
themselves if they can't destroy
the remaining units. Red needs
to defend against blue's
assault, and try sneaking
something to their HQ. Red
should win this map more often
than blue can.

==============
~~Chessboard~~
==============
Starting Units--9 Infantry, 2
Bikes, 2 Landers

Again, this map is best done in
Fog of War. This fight is fought
using all types of units, but
due to your economies, both
players should stick to just
land units, with the occasional
B Copter. The whole map, which
consists of several mountains
ahead that make ground units go
either left or right, screams
chokepoints.

Several Rockets or Artillery
will help you well. Make the
most of your starting Infantry,
too. Rushing into the enemy
Infantry is only going to get
them killed, but if you're
smart, you can actually make use
of them. Your Landers will
probably block eachother in the
channels, so don't think you're
going to win that way. Rushing
with CO units is a good way to
overwhelm your foe. The economy
isn't strong, so attacking fast
can easily destroy them.

===============
~~High Plains~~
===============
Starting Units--3 Infantry, 2
Mechs, 2 Bikes, Recon, Flare,
Artillery, 2 Tanks, Md Tank, War
Tank, Rig

This map can be tricky in Fog of
War. With every spot on the map
capable of being hid in, your
Flare is your only chance of
seeking out enemies. Navigate
the forests quickly, leaving
your Bikes and Recon to stay and
defend the HQ. They can hardly
move through the woods, so they
aren't useful anywhere else.

Try to wall in your Artillery
with your War Tank and Tanks.
The Artillery can dish out
damage the Flare finds, and the
Tank squadron can finish them
all up. Overall, it's an even
map, and if you pay attention to
where you find units, you can
seek out more enemy units,
eventually knocking them down to
only useless ones. At that
point, your Infantry can capture
their HQ. It's best to do that
instead of wondering around
trying to find the last unit or
two.

===============
~~Giraffe Map~~
===============
Starting Units--Flare, Tank,
Artillery, Missiles, Gunboat,
Submarine, Cruiser, Lander,
Battleship

One of those semi-symmetrical
maps that is just stupid. See
the factory at the center? Red's
probably going get it, and
that'll allow them to win
easily. Also, there's no
airports, so the Missiles are
completely worthless. Use them
to stall the enemy in the
chokepoints as you race for
properties.

Head for one of the islands
either on the west of the east.
The eastern one can help with
its factories if you use Landers
to transport them to the center
of the map. The western one has
a port. The choice is yours.
Nothing else to add to this map
as it's a standard battle. If
both teams are aggressive,
nobody should capture that
center factory. Whoever does,
however, can likely win the
match.

==================
~~8-Bridge Isles~~
==================
Red Starting Units--3 Infantry,
B Copter, 3 Dusters, 2 Fighters
Blue Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Anti-Air, Missiles, 2 B Copters,
2 Dusters

Both groups want to rush for one
of the center factories, while
trying to pick off enemy
Infantry. To be perfectly
honest, I can't see how blue can
win this map. Red has huge first
turn advantage, being capable of
destroying blue's air force on
the first turn, and the only
thing blue can do is kill one
plane with the Missiles and
injure another with an Anti-Air.

Those Infantry for blue aren't
going to help much, AND they
start with a dampered economy.
Yeah, little chance of them
winning. Whoever gets to be red
will end up winning this map
fairly easily.

=======
~~UFO~~
=======
Starting Units--Mech, Tank,
Artillery

As much as it looks like an HQ
capture is the way to go, don't
be so fooled. Move your Mech
towards the enemy HQ, but only
as a diversion. If you can
destroy the enemy Tank, you can
destroy their Artillery easily,
and after that, the Mech. Just
make sure the enemy Mech never
reaches your own HQ, or you will
be in trouble. Other than these
simple facts, it is a short map
for obvious reason.

==============
~~Robot Isle~~
==============
Build Bikes the first few days
and rush for your opponents
cities. Blue will get shafted a
bit in the beginning, but after
that it will be a mostly even
match. There are only a few
cities, and there will be a
constant power struggle over
them.

Keep building Tanks almost every
turn, stopping to build an
Artillery every now and then.
Try keeping your Artilleries
surrounded by the mountain
ranges down south to pound on
enemies that keep coming your
way. Using Tanks, try and block
off the center so you can
capture the cities, starting
with the ones owned by your
opponent. From this point, it's
merely going to be based on who
can use their Tanks more
effectively, and the better CO
Zone may come out ahead.

=================
~~Diagonal Isle~~
=================
This is an even, symmetrical
map. Use several Bikes to secure
the properties, then start
making Tanks, and maybe Recons
or Mechs. Depends on which you
want to use as cheap
meatshields. Mechs can be pretty
useful on this map as it is
highly likely your foe will
continue to build Tanks every
turn. Make sure to put your CO
into a Tank, retreating them if
they come close to being killed.

As you push into enemy
territory, you'll want to
capture their cities to hamper
their economy even further. Rush
with Tanks, and protect some of
them with cheaper units if you
can. Recons or Mechs work quite
nicely, and the Mechs can damage
enemy Tanks very nicely if you
ever get the chance.

================
~~Equal Island~~
================
As with all maps, go for the
nearby properties quickly. The
meteors will prevent the left
and right bridges from being
used effectively until being
destroyed. Don't attack any of
them until you are ready to
launch an offensive. Until that
point, hold the center bridge
with defensive units and
indirects.

Several naval units will also be
able to help you. Get a
Battleship onto the field to aid
in harming the enemy's hold on
the chokepoint. They can also
attack the meteors in order to
move your troops further. Other
than that, just amass Tanks
until you are ready to push
through. Several Anti- Tanks
will also be useful. If your
enemy makes them, get some Bikes
to injure them so they can't
harm your Tanks as much.

=================
~~Geometric Map~~
=================
Red will need to capture the two
cities close to their factories
in order to even out the
economies. Blue will be able to
build slightly more in that
amount of time, but it won't
prove to be too much of an
advantage. There's no
chokepoints on this map, so
Artillery won't be too useful
here. Go all out with Tanks,
every now and then building an
Anti-Tank to hopefully stall the
enemy's Tank advance.

There's not much else to say--
the map title says it all,
really. In clear weather, try to
counter what your foe is
building. In Fog of War, use
those woods to your advantage,
and maybe stick some Artillery
in there when the opponent can't
see them.

================
~~Mouse Island~~
================
Blue will get a slight advantage
by capturing one of your cities
a day before you can capture one
of theirs. Nothing too major,
though. For the most part, this
is a standard battle fought on
two fronts. There's the south,
and the middle. The northern
bridge shouldn't be the site of
too many battles, but keep a
Tank and Artillery stationed up
there incase the enemy decides
to attack.

The center will be the main
holding spot thanks to the
chokepoint. Have Artilleries in
the south and the center
pounding on enemy units. The
center city isn't likely to be
captured early on. Whoever does
capture it, however, probably
has the advantage at that point,
and they are likely to obtain
victory. Keep using Tanks and
Anti-Tanks through the battle.

===============
~~Striped Map~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Bike

Well, this is a pretty stupid
map. Both of your units should
gun for the silos right away and
target the enemy predeploys. If
they are weakened, they have no
chance of capturing a factory,
making it a worthless attempt.
You can retreat to your HQ to
heal and go capture a factory,
or continue moving the Bike to
the enemy HQ and capture it,
provided it wasn't weakened too
much. Fairly simple map. Whoever
reaches the enemy HQ first is
probably going to win.

===========
~~Mermaid~~
===========
Looks like a mermaid riding a
jet ski...yeah. Anyways, both
sides are even when it comes to
capturable properties, but the
southwest is up for grabs by
either side. It has three
factories, and it's pretty close
to the blue base. They can get
it first, possible, but if red
gets control of all three
factories, then blue will have a
lot of pressure put onto them.

Red needs to rush for them, blue
needs to stall until they can
capture them for their own (or
just prevent red from getting
them. It's not necessary for
blue to get them, but it helps).
Use Tanks and Artillery mostly,
as with most maps. Focus more on
Tanks and Md Tanks--this map has
few worthwhile chokepoints.

===============
~~Pretzel Map~~
===============
Each side should be able to
capture six properties on their
sides of the map, so it's a
moderately fair fight. There are
many ways to approach your
opponent on this map. Take your
time to build up an army, as
there aren't any factories near
the middle of the map.

The center isn't a chokepoint.
There are beaches on the sides
to manuver around, so blocking
it will only force your foe to
detour a bit, and in the end
you'll probably get injured or
defeated because of it. Don't be
stupid there. Try capturing
enemy cities if they leave them
unguarded--the economy advantage
will become apparent once you
begin outproducing your
adversary.

==============
~~Heaven Map~~
==============
Red has the early advantage,
mainly because they can reach
more properties in quicker time.
Blue needs to work quickly to
try and capture red's cities
near the center of the map. Save
up for a Battleship midway
through the battle--it can help
defeat your foe in the central
area of the map. Just make sure
that it doesn't get assualted by
other indirects or Submarines.

Just keep sending Tanks to the
center, and occasionally an
Anti-Tank to deal with the large
amount of Tanks that your foe
will produce. Try to park it on
one of your cities to keep it
healed from the minimal damage
that it will take. Keep Rockets
behind a wall of Tanks to try
and scare away the enemy units.
Try pushing through enemy lines
and take enemy cities until you
enter their base, ending the
battle.

==============
~~Jester Map~~
==============
Both sides can obtain an even
amount of cities, but the rush
for the center area is key to
securing most properties. You
only have land units to work
with, so take due care. The edge
of the lake is all beach, so
don't expect easy chokepoint
availability.

Tanks need to be used well here,
but making Infantry/Bike
meatshields for your Artillery
units, should you make them, is
also advised. You can also just
form walls with your Tanks. The
Artillery will remain safe so
long as the Tanks remain alive.
It's a pretty basic map overall,
just keep building streams of
units with your Tanks as you
overrun your adversary.

============
~~Cog Isle~~
============
This is a pretty simple map. All
you have is three buildings, two
of them being factories. There's
a mountain range between you and
the enemy HQ. Neither side is
going to get much farther than
making Mechs or Infantry each
turn. I suppose you could save
up for a Tank, but there will be
little action between both sides
on this map. It may even be more
of a stalemate the whole way
through. A Tank and Anti-Air, in
theory, could rip through any
Tanks and Infantry on the way to
the HQ. Escort a Bike there and
capture it, perhaps. Either way,
this is a boring map with little
applicable strategy.

=============
~~Zero Wood~~
=============
Whoever gets the factory in the
center of the map is probably
going to win the fight. Start
the match with several Infantry
gunning for the factory, and one
heading for a city on the
outskirts of the map. Make a
Flare to destroy any enemy
Infantry, and save up for a Tank
as well later on. Join Infantry
during the capture if they ever
get injured.

For whoever gets the factory,
just keep spamming units until
you have completely outproduced
your foe. If you keep using
Mechs, or Tanks every now and
then, your opponent has no
chance of winning. If you don't
get the factory first, you'll
need to do everything possible
to capture it before the match
goes downhill for you.

==================
~~Butterfly Isle~~
==================
This is yet another symmetrical
map. You want to capture your
enemy's cities nearby first to
harm them briefly, then set out
and capture everything else
around you. There is a port to
the north, but you shouldn't be
focusing on naval battles here.
The amount of funding in
comparison to the amount of
buildings you get just doesn't
justify the means, and it only
takes a cheaper Submarine to
take down your Battleship.
Unless you want to invest even
more in a Cruiser, in which case
this is just asking the enemy to
overrun your ground forces.

Focus on those the most. The
cities in the center of the map
probably won't have any definite
ownership due to that spot being
the main battleground between
both sides. It's a chokepoint,
so you naturally know what units
to be using in such a situation.
You have the income for Rockets,
but the terrain won't allow you
to reach it quickly. Focus on
building from the northern base
--it reaches the center quicker.

=============
~~Wing Cape~~
=============
There are no neutral properties
to be had, so what you have at
the start is what you have to
work with. It is a tiny map,
with two chokepoints, if you can
consider them chokepoints, at
the center. If both aren't
blocked off, then units can just
manuver around the first
chokepoint unhindered, so be
careful. Alternating between
building Mechs and Tanks is an
effective strategy. There are
limited funds to be earned per
day, so you'll want to make the
most of it. Alternatively, make
Recons if your foe keeps making
Mechs or Infantry themselves.

If in Fog of War, use the
various forests on the map to
your advantage. Sneak some
Artillery into them, then fire
upon unsuspecting enemies.

===============
~~Saber Range~~
===============
The center of the map is a key
focus point. Send waves of Tanks
down there, with an Artillery or
two. A good way to ruin enemy
plans is to save up for Rockets.
This will either provoke your
foe into attacking, which may or
may not harm you (be sure to
know beforehand if you can take
losses!), or it will push the
enemy back. Your goal is to gain
control of the center area of
the map.

You can grab the enemy cities as
you pass by the center, and then
continue pushing into the enemy
base. With strategic
Artillery/Rocket placement, you
can bombard anything else they
create. The turning point of
this map is the skirmish in the
center of the map. Don't be
afraid to attack first-- with
strong units, you can take on
your foe. An Anti-Tank is also
recommended, just so you can
destroy an enemy Tank when they
do attack. Just beware of
Infantry that sneak up to it.

================
~~Asphalt Maze~~
================
Try and capture the two cities
closest to you. Your opponent
will either attack the Bikes
capturing them constantly, or go
for their nearby cities as well.
Making only 7000G a day means
you can consistantly buy Tanks,
and due to the nature of the
map, Artillery are pretty
worthless. It's an open map, so
try sneaking around enemy forces
whenever possible. With a lack
of chokepoints, you should be
spreading your forces out, and
your opponent should be doing
the same as well in order to
halt any possible advance.

=================
~~Tennis Island~~
=================
Looking something like a tennis
court, this is a fair match. The
"net" is a plasma wall, so you
have your side to yourself until
a meteor gets destroyed. Rush
for the cities near the plasma
first. If your opponent puts an
Artillery there later, you'll
never be able to capture those
cities.

It goes without much saying that
you should build up an army with
mostly Tanks, backed with
several Artillery, before
breaking down a meteor and
rushing the army that your foe
has made. Breaking the meteor
first is cruicial as it allows
the first strike, but if you go
underprepared, then your foe
will stomp all over you. Make
sure it's an even match, then
break the plasma wall and
invade. The stronger side will
come out winning.

==================
~~Cut-Grass Isle~~
==================
The neutral cities in the
corners of the map are going to
be difficult to control for
either team. You may get one of
them, but decent players will
make Recons to halt any other
attempts at capturing those
properties. Because of this,
neither team is going to have a
strong economic advantage.
Thusly, try building indirects
to force the enemy army away
from one group of cities long
enough for you to capture them.

If you can secure one group of
cities before the enemy does,
then you can use the extra funds
to build Tanks and try stopping
the enemy force again from
trying to capture the other
cities. If you can do this, they
are pretty much done for. If
they do capture those cities,
it'll be a long battle. Make an
Anti-Tank every now and then to
make Tank rushes almost
worthless.

==================
~~Battle Stadium~~
==================
It's a pretty stupid symmetrical
map, but then again, most are.
No factories are near the
center, so it will become
annoying to keep taking several
days to assist your Infantry in
capturing the properties. I
advise trying to be sneaky and
making a Mech travel across the
mountains towards cities your
opponent has captured. In the
resulting fray in the center,
they may be too distracted to
notice.

Hide Artillery in forests or on
cities in Fog of War. They are
insanely useful here thanks to
the cities in the center that
can keep healing them. Be sure
to have a bunch of Tanks support
them, naturally. You may want to
make a Rockets every now and
then, but keep those on forests.
You don't want an enemy to spot
them quickly and destroy what
took you about two days worth of
funds to create. Be
conservative.

===============
~~Inner Wheel~~
===============
You'll have to fight in two
different corners of the map,
and you'll need to do it well.
The property rush is important,
but you'll want to secure the
silo if only to prevent your
opponent from using it. You can
try stalling their capturing
with it. Each side can get four
more properties, so everyone can
almost buy an Artillery and Tank
each turn.

Artilleries are insanely useful
with all of the chokepoints.
Also, using three of them, you
can win the map. Place one of
them three spaces from each
factory. Using those three
Artilleries, you can attack
anything your foe makes. Whoever
can complete this setup will
easily win the battle. Use Tanks
in order to accomplish this.

===============
~~Burger Isle~~
===============
Yet another stupid map. All each
side has to do is spam Infantry
or Bikes and run for the enemy
HQ. Build Flares or Anti-Airs to
destroy whatever is trying to
capture yours. With enough
persistance, lots of joining,
and some nearly killed Infantry,
one of you will likely win the
battle. It's all about holding
off the enemy capturing your HQ
while you finish capturing the
enemy's. If neither side can
capture it, blue will likely win
anyways thanks to the large
amount of neutral properties
near them.

===============
~~Triple Road~~
===============
The factory on the center island
is cruicial to victory. Ignore
other cities as you rush for it.
I advise bringing two Recons
along in order to stall enemy
movement from reaching the
factory, as well as giving you a
chance to finish capturing it.
Nothing else needs to be said
besides capture that middle
factory. Blue can't get there
first is red rushes, so they
will need to destroy the
Infantry on it. Artilleries are
great for the center of the map
thanks to all of the
chokepoints.

Try sneaking around the south
with Artillery support, then
grab enemy cities if they leave
them open. Winning this map
either takes grabbing the
factory, or using chokepoints to
your heavy advantage. Never
underestimate Rockets either in
this map. You've got a large
economy. Don't spend only on
Tanks.

================
~~Deep Defense~~
================
Red Starting Units--2 Tanks, 2
Anti-Airs, Missiles, 2 Rigs Blue
Starting Units--7 Infantry, 5
Bikes, 2 Tanks, 2 War Tanks, 2
Anti- Tanks, 2 B Copters, 8
Bombers

Stupid map. Red starts with an
insane amount of properties,
most of them close to blue's
starting units. Red will need to
assault blue with everything
they can. Build Bombers from the
airport near their HQ to halt
ground advancement, trying to
block chokepoints. Use Fighters
or Dusters to take care of
Bombers.

Blue should go straight for
red's cities and any production
property they can get hold of.
If blue gets enough momentum,
they'll be unstoppable. If red
can stall them for seeral turns,
it is possible that blue will be
defeated. It's up to a little
luck and quite a lot of skill. A
skilled blue player can easily
win this map. If the red player
knows what they're doing, they
will destroy blue before they
capture too many properties. Red
needs to use all of their funds
effectively.

===============
~~Desert Duel~~
===============
Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Recon, Artilery, Tank, 2 Md
Tanks, Anti-Tank

A pretty bland map. Each side
gets one factory, and is able to
capture one additional property.
Bikes will probably be the
commonly made unit, or Mechs if
you wish to get rid of enemy
Tanks effectively. Move all of
your units towards your enemy
and try to get the first strike
on them. It works better in Fog
of War due to the hiding spots
that ruins provide. If in Fog of
War, use it wisely to defeat
your enemy. Or go for an HQ
capture if you can lure them out
far enough. Keep your Recon on
your HQ in such a case.

=============
~~Ruby Keys~~
=============
Use your T Copters effectively
to capture many properties in a
quick amount of time. Go for
factories on the mainland first,
followed by cities on the tiny
islands to the south. The
center-north airport can prove
useful late into the battle, so
try getting that before your
opponent. Don't focus much on
naval units--a single Bomber can
take down a Battleship, and
Bombers are more versatile.

There will be a firefight over
the center properties. Use
Artillery to hurt enemies and
try to stall them with weaker
units, or air units, until you
can capture those propeties for
yourself. With an economic
advantage, and a ton of
airports, keep pushing back your
enemy. Use Tanks if they're
sending out Anti-Airs. Keep
pushing into their base and rout
them down. Or capture their HQ
if they have a Submarine hiding
somewhere for whatever reason.

===============
~~Rainy Haven~~
===============
Each side has a factory on an
island near them that they can
capture with ease, and then use
it to capture all of the enemy
cities on said island. Get there
quickly and make it happen. As
for the other, various small
islands, focus on getting
airports. Air units are far
superior to the even more
expensive naval units, and
nobody should be stupid to leave
something in the path of a
Cruiser.

Basically, it's a fair map for
the most part, with more focus
on aerial battles due to
unconnected islands. You can try
using Landers to invade the
enemy HQ, but that will probably
fail quickly. There's not much
on this map worth noting. A few
Cruisers will actually be useful
because some aerial battles will
be over the ocean. Make it
count.

===============
~~Face Island~~
===============
A standard, small map. Red will
want to capture blue's preowned
city as quickly as possible,
then try and secure any other
cities they can. Focus on
building Tanks for the majority
of this map. If you can sneak a
Rockets or two into the center
mountain area, and keep them
protected, you can attack
anything your foe makes from
their factories. This is
expensive and difficult, so it's
best just to stick with Tanks.
It's a small map, but can turn
into a stalemate if you wait too
long.

Attack from the opposite side of
the map if you can't make much
progress. Even out your forces
incase your opponent gets the
same idea.

=================
~~Spectacle Map~~
=================
Each side gets two factories and
access to a ton of cities.
There's really not much to say
for this map. It works amazing
in Fog of War, and in that,
hiding Artillery on many of your
cities is a great idea. Outside
of that, you'll probably just
focus on Tanks like any normal
map. Never stop trying to stop
capturing properties. You'll
want to have a constant high
economy, so keep producing Tanks
and Artillery (less often if
there's clear weather). If you
can take a ton of your foe's
cities, you are at the point
where you can beat the map.

================
~~Split Island~~
================
Use your T Copters to get to
central property quickly, and
invest in several Dusters to
interfere with enemy capturing.
With the large amounts of
mountains and forests blocking
access to the center, focus on
aerial units more than ground
units is advised. B Copters will
work just fine here. They aren't
expensive, and easily rip
through Tanks. If the enemy
isn't using Bombers, just build
Anti-Airs. Missiles aren't
effective here anyways, but try
using them if the enemy starts
to spam Bombers.

Like most maps, hold the center
until you're ready to push
through your enemy. As you're
doing so, use T Copters to
capture enemy cities to make a
counterattack difficult for
them, securing your victory.

===============
~~Eon Springs~~
===============
Each side only gets three
neutral properties to capture,
and there won't be any fighting
over them. You'll have to focus
on the north, south, and most
importantly, center. Each HQ is
open for capture more than
easily by the opponent, so keep
it guarded at all times.

You only have so much money to
work with, you'll need to
balance it out. Focus on
whichever part of the map your
opponent is sending the most
units towrds, and try countering
it. You don't want them getting
too much control in one area,
otherwise they will push into
your base and start capturing
properties, giving them an even
bigger advantage, to the point
where you won't be capable of
winning. Defend until you can
assault, then dismantle their
economy to boost your chances of
winning.

=================
~~Portal Bridge~~
=================
For this map, you'll want to
obtain an HQ capture. Because
the HQ's are on isolated
islands, this is actually easy
to achieve. Capture the airports
then start amassing funds.
You'll want a T Copter and
Infantry, obviously, and several
Dusters to serve as meatshields
for the capturing Infantry. Once
you have your forces, head for
the enemy HQ, keeping the T
Copter protected.

Be sure to keep making other air
units in order to prevent your
HQ from being captured. Try
Fighters and destroy the T
Copter in one shot if they allow
it to be vulnerable like that.
In only three turns of flight
you can have the HQ, just make
sure you keep that Infantry safe
from Dusters. Putting Artillery
on the bridges can also be
helpful in guarding your HQ.
Just beware of Tanks.

============
~~Boxed In~~
============
As the title says, ground troops
are worthless. Use only Infantry
for capturing, but focus on a
navy otherwise. You will want to
capture the enemy HQ to end this
quickly, and that's actually an
easy task if you can work
towards it.

Make Battleships and Submarines.
Use Submarines to scout ahead,
or if not in Fog of War, at the
least to find enemy Submarines.
Make a Lander and have 2
Infantry board it so they can
heal eachother incase one gets
damaged during the capture.
Then, just work your way up one
side of the map unitl you reach
the HQ island. Block the enemy
ports with Lander to prevent
Battleship movement, and you can
make the map end pretty quickly.
Just work effectively.

================
~~Marching Map~~
================
Capture the factories
immidiately, then start to hold
the two chokepoints at the north
and south edges of the map. The
radar tower is a must if you are
in Fog of War, otherwise the
additional funds will merely be
moderately useful in clear
weather. Keep making Tanks and
Artillery, and eventually you
will be able to push through
enemy lines in the chokepoints.
Once you do it, assist in
destroying the second chokepoint
so you have your entire fighting
force heading straight for the
enemy base. At that point, you
will easily be able to win. Just
hold the chokepoint until you
can assault.

==================
~~Hourglass Isle~~
==================
You'll want to capture the
properties relatively quickly.
The factories at the center of
the map will be seeing the most
action for a while. The center
cities will constantly be under
fire, and likely won't be
captured. If a chokepoint is
established, send units down the
sides of the map in order to
attempt breaking it up. Of
course, those can be turned into
chokepoints as well, so you'll
need to work quickly.

Tank with Artillery assitance is
key. There's not many
properties, so whoever can
capture more enemy cities first
will get a huge advantage to the
point where they will likely win
the map.

=================
~~Scissor Basin~~
=================
This is an odd map, and
generally turns into a long
battle. Red starts with less
properties, but if they hurry,
they can win the match. Red
needs to grab all of the
factories near the bridges, then
hold them off as chokepoints,
preventing enemy passage or
capturing. They should also try
to push into blue's territory
and take their cities. Blue will
need time to reach additional
cities, and that's all red needs
to do to get an advantage and
win the map fairly handily.

Blue needs to at the least
defend the factories. The two
factories in the east make for
great chokepoints as well, and
often are fought over. All you
need to do in this battle is
make effective work of the
chokepoints and destroy the
enemy army when they make simple
mistakes in trying to push
through your chokepoint
positions.

=================
~~Barren Plains~~
=================
Starting Units--20 Infantry, 2
Bikes, 4 Anti-Tanks

As the title suggests, there's
nothing on this map except for
plains. Charge your imposing
army straight at your foe, and
go for an all out fire fight.
Keep Anti-Tank behind the wall
of Infantry and try to pick off
any weakened Infantry with them.
Remember that Infantry and Bikes
are quite effective against
Anti-Tanks so you'll need to be
careful. There's nothing special
about this map. Try capturing
the enemy HQ with a Bike if
there's an opening you can
squeeze through. Just make sure
the enemy can't destroy that
Bike.

================
~~Square Canal~~
================
Due to the mountains blocking
the bridges, this will turn into
a naval battle pretty quickly.
Also, there's not too many
cities on the map, so the amount
of ships used by each side will
be limited. When the battle
shifts to that, build lots of
Gunboats, and have temporary
ports established. Gunboats are
insanely useful here, especially
on Fog of War. Their cheap price
comes with great effectiveness.

The center island is only useful
if you have plenty of Landers on
hand to transport ground troops
to different parts of the map.
If you can do that, then the
battle is pretty much won since
your foe may be focusing too
much on naval units. Ground
troops aren't effective
otherwise in this battle.

================
~~Beaker River~~
================
The center island will be the
important point of this map. Get
the factories first, then hold
off the chokepoint. An HQ
capture is effective on this map
because there are no unit
producing buildings near them.
Use T Copters to reach one
quickly, with several B Copters
or Dusters to guard them from
enemy attack. Do this only once
most of the center islands are
under your possession, otherwise
the enemy will likely still be
strong enough to take down your
capture attempt.

But if you do take the islands,
the HQ capture will be simple.
Your enemy will likely have a
weaker economy at that point, so
they won't be able to
counterattack effectively.
Victory will be yours. Stick an
Anti-Air on your HQ for safety
to ensure it won't be captured
so easily.

=================
~~Scatter Isles~~
=================
This map is full of chokepoints,
so be sure to make tons of
Artilleries and Rockets whenever
possible, along with Tank
shields, to batter your enemies
from a distance. Due to the
nature of the map, this works
quite well. An HQ capture here
is also possible because of the
easy access to it, and if two
shields are put up next to both
bridges, than an Infantry can
capture it unimpaired.

You need to prevent that. As
long as you're paying attention
to what your enemy is doing,
that won't prove to be much of a
problem. Try to capture as many
as the center properties as
possible before too many strong
units get there. Once they do,
any additional capturing will be
difficult to accomplish. Keep
pushing your enemy with the
chokepoints unitl you reach
their base, finishing the
remaining units.

================
~~Scenic Route~~
================
This map is favored towards red.
They start with more properties,
and can reach the ones in the
west far quicker than blue. Red
should secure the factories,
then push south towards the
other group of properties. Blue
can only get one additional
factory while red gets two,
making it even easier for them
to win. The chokepoint on the
center of the map shouldn't even
be important. Blue has little
chance of winning this map no
matter how you look at it. Red
shouldn't let them have a chance
of capturing many properties,
and once red has an insane
economy, a bunch of Tanks will
overrun blue with ease.

==============
~~Pitted Map~~
==============
For this symmetrical map,
holding the center chokepoints
is important. You should try to
delay enemy advancement towards
neutral cities if at all
possible. Send Mechs over the
mountains and towards cities the
enemy will likely try capturing.

The center factories are also
important to control, and you
should try getting to those
first. If you control one of
them you'll be in good shape. If
you control both, you'll
probably end up winning the
battle. Use the bridge
chokepoints effectively, and use
Rockets/Artillery to attack your
opponent's center factory. It'll
help in overrunning.

=================
~~Forest Island~~
=================
This map works best in Fog of
War. The center factory is
cruicial to winning this map.
Red will always get there first,
but blue can send streams of
Infantry towards the factory to
destroy red's Infantry and try
taking it for themselves. There
aren't many neutral properties,
so you'll be stuck making mostly
Tanks. They can't move very far
in the forests, though. If in
Fog of War, naturally use
Artilleries all the time. There
are plenty of hiding spots,
especially if you can sneak one
near the enemy factories.

=============
~~Swan Cove~~
=============
Red has little chance of winning
this map. Blue starts with twice
as many cities, and they can
easily form an army to destroy
any attempt that red makes at
trying to capture a similar
amount of properties. Blue
should secure the center island,
bringing along Mechs over there
to capture it effectively, as
well as injure any of red's
attempts at getting it. Red
should use Gunboats to reach the
island. It's cost effective.

If red can get momentum, unless
they capture everything on the
center island, they don't have
much chance of winning this map,
unfortuantely. It is quite
unfair for them.

=================
~~Seven Islands~~
=================
Both sides want to race for the
center island. It's quite
important in winning the map.
The factory should be captured
first, if only so that you can
produce more Infantry to capture
the remaining properties. That
island also has two ports, so
you can defend from both sides.
This will be a long naval
battle, and be sure to establish
temporary ports on several
sections of the map. They will
prove useful, especially since
you should be using a decent
amount of Gunboats. They need to
be resupplied constantly.

Try to get an economy advantage
if the enemy ceases to occupy an
island. Don't ever make that
mistake. You need to produce as
big a navy as possible to
overrun your enemy.

==============
~~Great Lake~~
==============
There's only one neutral
property, and blue is going to
want it in order to even up the
property total for each side.
There's not much to this map.
Although you have access to a
navy, Gunboats are the only
ships you'll be able to afford.
They can prove useful if you try
transporting Infantry to capture
the enemy HQ. I doubt your
opponent will let that happen,
naturally. Focus on making Tanks
every turn instead, but make
Gunboats if your enemy makes
them too. Just make temporary
ports so you don't have to
constantly retreat them when in
the middle of a fight.

=================
~~Double Bridge~~
=================
The actual bridges aren't even
that important. There's no
chokepoint there you can
exploit, and you can get there
with T Copters instead of
busting down a meteor. Pretty
pointless and stupid to be
honest. Try and get the factory
on the island merely for the
funds. Unless you want to have a
Lander shuttle units built
there, I'd say just don't use
it. Putting a Missiles on that
island is nice, however, and can
scare off enemy air units.

This map isn't anything special.
Both brawlers will fight mainly
at the bridges midway through
the match, and whoever pushes
into enemy territory first is
going to win. Make effective use
of B Copters. You don't have
much money to use, so these
cheap helicopters work wonders
against enemy Tanks.

================
~~Grid Islands~~
================
Red starts with one less
property, and there's nothing
neutral to capture. Throughout
this match you will want to
cover as many chokepoint bridges
as possible, then try pushing
through squares and capturing
enemy cities, eventually
diminishing their army. The map
works well that way. Red will
need to work fast in order to
secure another property before
blue uses that to their
advantage. Build a Battleship
every now and then--they are
great at helping get through
chokepoints. Hell, they can park
themselves on bridges and block
it themselves. Your call.
Nothing notable on this map.

=================
~~Marine Bridge~~
=================
Use Bikes to secure the
properties either north or south
of your factories. The problem
you have to face with is that
there is a direct route to your
HQ from the enemt factories.
Sure, the same applies to the
enemy, but you need to be
worried a bit. There's going to
be a fight in the middle of the
map, and because the bridge is
so wide, Artilleries aren't
going to be too useful. Push
through with Tanks, backing up
with Anti-Tanks, and have a Bike
stay in the middle of the pack.
Try to get it to the enemy HQ
with ease. If you want to be
devious, try blocking access to
your HQ by placing Landers on
the beach. They'll be annoying
to destroy.

==============
~~Hat Harbor~~
==============
This map is somewhat
symmetrical. Access to the enemy
HQ is merely a T Copter ride
away. Make Dusters out of your
airports to either escort your T
Copter and Infantry, or guard
your own HQ from being captured.
The choice is yours.

Smart players aren't going to
let their HQ's get captured at
all. Place Infantry down south
anyways in order to capture the
properties. Whoever gets the
southern airport will make
capturing the HQ a lot easier.
Instead of capturing the enemy
HQ right away, try getting the
airport. You'll find capturing
the enemy HQ a breeze,
hopefully, if you get it. Keep
assisting an air force with your
airports from the north.

=================
~~Vision Bridge~~
=================
The northern properties on this
map is easier to hold because
the forests will slow down enemy
advancement towards the
buildings. The center island is
harder to keep hold of because
of the opposite. The center
island, naturally, is the more
valuable one because of its
factories and two ports. You
aren't likely to get all of
them, but you want that factory.
Rush it at the start of the
match, then try and get both
factories. You'll easily win the
match if both factories are
yours. If you only get one of
them, keep putting pressure on
your opponent and never stop
sending waves of troops until
that second factory is yours.
When you have both, you can
easily launch an offensive
against the enemy base,
finishing the battle in a quick
amount of time.

================
~~Antipode Map~~
================
Red starts with a single less
city, but that shouldn't matter
too much in the long run. Most
of the neutral cities are placed
far away from both bases, so
you'll need to use some effort
to grab them and keep hold of
them effectively. While the
fight for the northern cities is
going on, you can try sneaking
around enemy lines with naval
units. The battle in the south
should use Tanks and Artillery,
with some Battleship support.
Just don't let those expensive
ships get sunk easily.

Keep sending Tanks south and
north, moreso to whichever front
is getting more enemy
resistance. Bide your time unitl
you think you can overtake your
opponent. Or spam more ships and
hope they waste oodles of cash
trying to counter your navy,
giving you a temporary ground
advantage.

==================
~~Spanner Island~~
==================
Most ground troops are quite
ineffective here thanks to the
roadblocking mountains. Spam
Infantry into the center to
capture as many cities as
possible, and prevent enemy
captures as best as you can. Use
Gunboats to transport Infantry
over to the side islands to
capture even more cities.

This funding will help you build
a navy, which you will need to
create in order to beat your
enemy. There's nothing else
besides standard naval combat
warfare that really needs to be
said. Counter what your enemy
builds, or if in Fog of War,
what you think they are
building. Put your CO in a
Battleship for added defense.
Can't be too safe.

=================
~~Ring Mountain~~
=================
This is a large map with many
properties, so expect a long
battle. Rush for the center of
the map and try getting the
factories. The airport isn't as
important because sticking a
Missiles nearby will waste all
effort put into building units
there. If you get complete
control of the center area,
however, and that requires a lot
of fighting most likely, as well
as constant streams of Tanks
from other factories, then you
can easily win the map.

Also consider placing Rockets in
spaces so that they can attack
the enemy factories from across
the mountains, rendering them
mostly useless. Or you can have
them assist in taking control of
the center area. Either method
works fine. It will be a long
fight, but make the most of the
chokepoints.

===============
~~Rail Strait~~
===============
Blue starts with a large
monetary advantage at the
beginning. What both sides need
to do is rush the center island
and capture the lone factory
there. Whoever does this first
basically gets complete control
of the island, and thereby gets
a huge economy. For red, this
means an even playing field.
Blue pretty much secures a win
by doing this.

Blue should also try and get
more properties north and south
of them, while red needs to stop
them from expanding, and focus
on assaulting their main base.
Three Landers can easily take
care of that (one to plug the
port, and the other two carrying
strong units to destroy whatever
is on the factories).

=================
~~Tribe Islands~~
=================
Red will have an insanely low
chance of winning this map. Blue
starts with more cities, and has
easy to access to far more than
red does. Red's preowned cities
can also be captured by blue
quickly, but not the other way
around. Red can try putting up a
good fight, but in the hands of
a decent player, red has almost
no chance of winning this map.
Red need to focus on naval
domination for any chance of
winning, but blue has more
funding to win such a battle.

==================
~~Bellow Islands~~
==================
Red starts with a single less
property, but they have the
advantage of being able to reach
the center first. By doing so,
they can try securing more
properties. Get a Gunboat out
quickly and get an Infantry to
one of the side islands to
capture the lone city on it.

Bring to the center of the map
several Recons and Flares to
disrupt enemy capturing. After a
few days, start sending Tanks
down there with some Artillery
support. Any uncaptured property
is likely to remain uncaptured
at this point. Keep sending
Tanks down to the middle, with
the occasional Anti-Tank, and
push your way into the enemy
base. It's a long bridge, so the
enemy can stall with the large
chokepoint using Artilleries
effectively.

================
~~Central Lake~~
================
Here's a stupid map. There's
nothing remotely interesting
about this map. Each player has
only two properties, but there's
a ton of things available for
capture. Rush for the central
factories before getting the
cities near your HQ. If you can
get at least one of those
factories, you'll be in good
shape because you can begin
capturing a lot more.

Also, use up the silos early so
they don't harm you more later
on in the match. Gun for the
airports in the northeast corner
so you have aerial domination.
You should also get the airports
in the southwest corner, too.
Basically, it's all an economics
map. Whoever has the most center
factories and cities will likely
win the map with little contest.

==============
~~Piston Dam~~
==============
Each HQ is lying out in the
open, so going for an HQ capture
is the best option. This will be
tricky since both sides have
access to airports. Use a T
Copter and prepare to storm the
HQ. You'll want to focus on a
ground assault as well because
most strong aerial units are
quite expensive. Shift between
Anti-Airs and Tanks as you head
for the enemy HQ. Once you get
over there, expect some
resistance. If you're lucky, you
can destroy what weak forces
your enemy gathered over there
and capture the HQ. Just make
sure you fortify your own,
otherwise you may lose by having
your own HQ captured.

=============
~~Snowflake~~
=============
Both sides will need to race for
as many cities as they can.
There are two factories in
corners of the map, but they are
far from the actual action in
this map, so they won't be too
useful. You want to keep
producing Tanks and sending them
to the center of the map. You
want to make it a goal to
overrun one of your foe's
factories and capture it for
yourself. If you can do this for
any of their factories, a
victory is quite ensured. Take
your time in doing so, and only
invade when you're sure of
victory.

================
~~Clown Island~~
================
This can be a hectic map. Many
sections are closed off, and
everyone has airports. For the
first few days, use Infantry and
Bikes to capture as many
properties as you possible can.
Once the battle gets going, you
may want to focus on aerial
units. You can use them in
conjunction with Infantry to try
and capture the enemy HQ, which
happens to be right next to
yours. A T Copter works too. To
prevent, have an Anti-Air park
on your HQ. You'll be glad you
did.

Not much to say about this map,
sadly. Capture and destroy at
every oppertunity. As mentioned,
an HQ capture is the best method
of victory.

================
~~Up and Under~~
================
This will probably be a long
battle. You'll want to capture
at least one of their airports
right away. That way you can
access the northern island, and
capture the properties up there.
Get the ports--Battleship
support during a ground invasion
is highly advised. Just don't do
so until you have a strong
economy running. The factories
in the north are only useful to
capture more properties up
north, sadly. There's no beaches
for Lander ferrying. Use
Artillieries in the chokepoint
in the center of the map, and
hold it down until you can push
through it. This could be a
moderately long battle.

------------------
~5C.3 Player Maps~
------------------
In 3 Player Maps, there will be
a third base added on every map,
making it a battle royale. Most
of these maps are even for each
player, but some of them are a
tad unfair. Online, these can
only be played in friend
matches.

================
~~Rotor Battle~~
================
Red Starting Units--3 Mechs,
Flare, Md Tank, Anti-Tank, B
Copter Blue Starting Units--5
Infantry, 3 Mechs, 2 Tanks, War
Tank, Anti-Tank, Missiles Yellow
Starting Units--5 Infantry, 2
Mechs, 3 Bikes, Tank, War Tank,
2 Anti-Tanks, B Copter

Blue and yellow should team up
to overrun red. Red has a
factory, and if left unchecked,
they can easily win this battle.
Whoever has possession of that
factory is realistically the
team that can win the battle.
Whoever finishes overruning red
should capture the factory for
themselves. Capture their
airport as well. All red needs
to do is sit tight until they
have enough funds to finish off
blue and yellow. If red gets
overrun at the start, well,
nothing can really be done about
that.

=================
~~Delta Heights~~
=================
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Tank, Artillery, Anti-Air

Pretty small and quick map. All
of the HQ's are in the center,
so move your units towards that
spot. Red gets shafted on this
because they have to enter
either yellow's or blue's
territory to access the center.
However, they can put their
Artillery in range of their own
HQ and sit still, hopefully
letting blue and yellow kill
themselves. At least try to get
the silo for yourself. It may
prove useful to whoever gets it
first.

============
~~Fan Isle~~
============
Everybody is even on this map in
terms of properties. Red
technically has the advantage as
they can reach the center island
first, threby getting most of
the properties before anyone
else. That won't stop blue and
yellow from fighting over the
island as well. The center
airport, which can be a huge
help in the battle, will
constantly be fought over.

Since everyone is on an island,
this will become more of a naval
battle than anything else. You
probably won't be getting an
outstanding economy, so focus
mainly on cheap Gunboats with
the occasional Submarine to sink
most other ships that your foes
may build. If possible, team up
with an opponent and take over
one of the other players'
islands. There will be a fight
for settlement on the now
unowned property. Whoever claims
it will be destined to win. Of
course, an HQ capture grants you
all the properties, so try
sneaking that in if possible.

=================
~~Gridlock Glen~~
=================
Each team will need to work
quickly to secure properties,
most notable the airports that
are surrounded by mountains and
rivers/ They will take some time
to capture as you can't quickly
transport Infantry over to them,
so be patient and stall enemy
forces if any are in the area.
This map is full of chokepoints,
and you have to be worried about
being attacked from any
direction.

Be careful where you move your
units, and try to push through
one enemy base instead of both
at once. Distract a foe with
several units, then attack full
force at a different base and
try to capture the HQ for a huge
property advantage.

=================
~~Kidney Island~~
=================
Blue is pretty unlucky here.
They're smack in the middle of
red and yellow, so they are open
to attack from both forces. As
such, blue is likely to lose
here unless they get serious
defense going. Red is closest,
so they should be concerned
mainly about them. Red and blue
will do a lot of fighting with
eachother, allowing yellow to
sneak around the map, capturing
properties and preparing an
army.

When one side loses, yellow
should invade and finish off the
weakened army that remains, if
possible. The defending army
should use their built up funds
to defend against yellow, and
eventually make an offensive.
Just be careful as yellow will
likely have a property advantage
for most of the battle.

================
~~Plasma Peaks~~
================
Starting Units--3 Infantry

You need to have your starting
Infantry capture any properties
available, or at least move to
some. Red is capable of
obtaining two of the airports,
giving them an advantage. Your
factories should focus on
producing Bikes to get more
properties. There's no ground
access to every location on the
map, but red can fight yellow,
and blue can fight yellow.
Yellow needs an airport, and
should take out blue as quickly
as possible. With no nearby
factories at their HQ, you
should try capturing it quickly.

You can't exploit the many
chokepoints here very well. Try
using Missiles, however, to
alter the paths of most aerial
units. This may give you a
slight advantage, or at least
stall enemy air units long
enough to destroy/ injure them.

=============
~~Poem Cape~~
=============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Recon, Artillery, Tank, War
Tank, Anti-Air, Rig

This map works best in Fog of
War. Otherwise, blue is going to
get demolished quickly. It's
best to board the Rig with an
Infantry and capture the HQ's in
the north. Use most of your
units to protect the capturing
Infantry, or destroy anyone who
dares come close to your HQ.
This is a fialry quick map, but
you have to play offensively, or
your HQ will be captured and
you'll fail.

=============
~~Blue Lake~~
=============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Recon, Artillery, Tank,
Rockets, Rig, Lander, Submarine,
Battleship, B Copter

This is a fairly simple map, and
each player starts off fair. The
naval battle likely isn't going
to go far. Each player will try
destroying eachother Battleships
with their Submarines, and the
Submarines are going to run out
of gas eventually. Once the
coast is clear, try and get an
Infantry to the silo and launch
it at a group of units. This
will help in taking them down,
which benefits you and another
player. Merely play defensively
for a while until it's safe to
rush your opponents.

================
~~Pyramid Cape~~
================
Red starts with more properties
than either of the other teams,
so they will have and easier
time at winning. Blue and yellow
have to team up and destroy red,
otherwise they'll just wipe each
other out, and red can easily
mop up the mess. Blue and yellow
have tons of available property,
while red is limited a bit. If
blue and yellow get some
momentum, they can overcome red,
and then finish each other off.
Try capturing red's factories
once they have been killed off.
They will aid in destroying any
of your opponent's occupation in
the area. Nothing else to this
map. Just keep capturing.

================
~~Bead Islands~~
================
The property dispertion is off
at the beginning of the match.
Red will have a difficult time
as some of their properties on
adjacent islands can be captured
quickly by other teams. Red will
need to work fast to capture
other properties. This map will
quickly turn into a naval
battle. Keep making Gunboats and
Submarines, with the occasional
Cruiser to take down enemy
Submarines. Put your CO in a
unit you're going to keep
protected. A Cruiser works
nicely. Just don't put it in a
Submarine, especially a
submerged one. Focus on
bombarding one base with
Battleships eventually, then
attack the other once one team
is out of the match.

================
~~Archipelagos~~
================
This map is a bunch of split up
islands. Capture a port quickly,
then spread your Infantry to
other islands and continue
capturing ports. There won't be
much land to fight over. Capture
as many properties as you can to
boost your economy. You'll want
to produce Submarines and
Battleships constantly, as this
will be a long naval battle.
Using several Battleships, you
want to try and take over
islands that your opponents have
already captured.

By doing this, you'll sever
their economies bit by bit.
Continue building strong units
until one enemy base is finally
overrun. By that point, if you
did the destruction, you should
have a much higher economy than
your last opponent that you can
take them down, hopefully, with
ease.

================
~~Knotted Keys~~
================
Yellow starts with the most
properties, and has a similar
amount of capturable properties
compared to the other two teams.
Thusly, red and blue should team
up to destroy yellow before they
become too powerful.
Alternatively, you can capture
one of your opponent's HQ's,
giving you a far higher
advantage than yellow has.

Try getting the silos to aid
your conquest, and use
Artillieries to your advantage
in the various chokepoints
across the map. It's not too bad
of a map. Just be defensive for
a while until you're sure you
can overtake one of your foe's.

===============
~~Clover Keys~~
===============
Same old same old for this map.
Yellow has little chance of
winning here. There's a bunch of
neutral properties in the
southwest, but yellow has no
easy access there, so they are
likely to be overrun pretty
quickly. As for blue and red,
they should make use of the many
bridges in this map and build a
decent amount of Artillery, with
several Tanks to assist them.
Make some Anti-Tanks if your
opponent is building the same.
With a little persistance, you
can easily push your opponent
into their base.

================
~~Keyhole Cove~~
================
Each team is pretty even in this
map. Yellow gets their own
island to themselves, so no
ground troops will be able to
reach them without Lander
support. They also get easy
access to all southern
properties. Red and blue should
travel down the roads and
interfere with what yellow is
planning. The need to stop the
capturing as soon as possible
before too much momentum is
gained.

For the most part, this will be
a naval and aerial battle. Use
ground units sparingly, but
build whatever you need to
counter enemy units. Anti- Airs
will be insanely useful here.
Also have some Dusters, possibly
putting your CO in one of them
to make it crazy powerful on the
field. Nothing important to note
about this map. Just play
agressively.

================
~~Mantis River~~
================
All of the neutral properties
are cities, so you should take
care of your land units in this
map. The center of the map will
be a sort of crossroads between
all three teams. Red is actually
capable of holding off both
teams at the bridges with
Artillery, so try doing that if
you're red. If not, back up your
troops with Rockets, then try
and fight your way through the
chokepoint.

Red is in the middle, and if
they lose the center then they
will quickly be destroyed.
Whoever gets red's factories
will have an advantage on their
opponent, and they can spam
Tanks until they rush through
their final adversary.

================
~~Channel City~~
================
Red may start with more cities,
but yellow and blue can expand
faster and reach more properties
to even it up. This will be
another naval battle for most of
the fight. Red shouldn't
interefere too much, mainly
because blue and yellow are
likely to keep on fighting
amongst each other.

Red should only get involved in
the naval brawl once one team
starts to weaken. They should
try capturing the HQ, mooching
off the work of the other team.
The remaining team needs to
prevent this, or at least rout
the other team to prevent red
from getting a ton of
properties. Not much to this
battle, but keep capturing
undefended properties.

=============
~~Ink Canal~~
=============
Yellow has a severe advantage
here. They can capture a ton of
properties fairly easily, and
red and blue will likely fight
with each other constantly over
the battle. Yellow can sit back,
get an even bigger economic
advantage, then mooch kill
whichever is the losing army.
Red and blue don't have the
funds to fight two armies at
once, and if they try, they will
likely fail the map even faster.
For yellow, work quickly. For
red and blue, try to avoid each
other and take as many
properties while you have the
chance.

=============
~~Gem Creek~~
=============
This is one of the stupider
maps. Yellow has an island to
themselves, while the other
teams only have small bits of
property. Yellow's island has
the most neutral properties, so
both teams will be rushing onto
yellow's island. Yellow needs to
defend their territory, and if
they can secure their own
island, while fending off enemy
units from both sides of the
island, then they can easily win
this map. Otherwise, yellow will
easily be eliminated from this
mission.

If blue and red get control of
the island, there will be a
power struggle between the two
armies. Whoever completely
controls the island will easily
win the battle.

=================
~~Glass Heights~~
=================
Red has a pretty clear advantage
here, starting with twice as
many properties as the other
teams. However, they have to
cross a bunch of forests to
reach neutral properties,
slowing them down. Blue and
yellow need to take advantage of
this and get themselves all of
the neutral properties near
them.

Once they do that, the property
total will be about even. If
this happens, red will likely be
crippled as it takes them time
to send a bunch of units through
the forests. Blue and yellow can
attack from both sides of red's
base, using the chokepoints
against red's advantage, taking
them down. The path from blue's
base to yellow's is a huge
chokepoint, and whoever gets the
factory in the middle is going
to have an easier time winning.
Rush it from the start and don't
lose hold of it.

=================
~~Devil's Inlet~~
=================
All sides should go for all
nearby properties. Yellow should
focus on the cities up north so
red doesn't get hold of them.
This battle will be taking place
completely in the air thanks to
none of the teams having access
to each other's bases on the
ground. It could be a long
battle if Anti-Airs and Fighters
are being made constantly.
There's no other real advice for
aerial battles other than trying
to outwit your opponents. If you
succeed in taking someone down,
capture their properties and
start cranking out aerial units
to overrun your last foe.

==============
~~Sheer Port~~
==============
Red starts with, and has access
to, more properties, making this
an unfair fight. Ground troops
are rather useless here, so
you'll have to stick to a navy.
Red will be able to outproduce
anything blue and yellow create,
so those two teams should join
and defeat red. There may be a
land battle for trying to claim
red's properties, and if that
happens, try rushing your
opponents HQ in the chaos. They
may leave it unguarded,
especially if they continue
focusing on building more naval
units and not ground units.
Landers with Tanks and Bikes
work wonders.

===============
~~Liar's Cove~~
===============
Yellow has a huge advantage at
the start from what it appears,
but they are pretty much even.
Blue and red need to settle on
yellow's island to expand, as
well as attack anything (since
naval battles will be too
expensive to maintain from the
start). Use T Copters to reach
the island quickly, then capture
any neutral factory.

Yellow will want to fend off
enemy advancement, but that'll
prove difficult as both teams
will keep bringing more and more
units inland. Red and blue may
get into a property struggle and
end up focusing on each other,
in which case yellow can assist
the stronger side to eliminate a
competitor. It'll be a bit more
of an even match once someone
gets eliminated.

==============
~~Nail Canal~~
==============
Blue and yellow have no choice
but to team up. Red starts with
a ton of properties, and the
other teams will take a while to
catch up. Red, in the meantime,
can build a huge army to defend
the chokepoints north of them.
When the opposing armies come,
they merely need to use several
Rockets, along with some
Artillery and a bunch of Tanks,
to push back the weak forces
that the other armies will bring
in. From there, red can spread
around the map, capturing back
their properties, and pushing
into both bases. Yeah, red is
basically guarenteed victory.
It's a rather stupid map.

If the other groups cna use
their factories close to red
effectively (provided they get
there before red), and save
money, the other armies can
actually overtake red. Once red
is gone, it'll still be a long
map, but at the least it'll be
fair.

===============
~~Atlas River~~
===============
None of the groups have any land
support to the other islands, so
this will be primarily an aerial
battle. Each island has a
similar amount of properties, so
it'll remain fair throughout.
There's not much to say about
this map, sadly. It's a fair,
all-around map, and it's
unlikely you'll be joining up
with another group to take down
a single base. Focus on air
defense before offence. It'd be
stupid if a group of Bombers and
a T Copter came and took your HQ
all because you were busy
spamming Bombers yourself or
something.

================
~~Eel Channels~~
================
The overview of this map remains
the same as Atlas River, except
now you have to use a navy
instead of an air force.
Shouldn't make the map much
different. Red will have a
difficult time as most neutral
properties are available only to
blue and yellow. They'll need to
rush if they don't want to fall
behind in terms of army
strength.

Focus on Battleships and
Submarines. Make a Cruiser every
now and then to ensure enemy
Submarines stay away from your
Battleship fleet. Move your way
towards an enemy island, then
injure their land forces with
the Battleships. Bring in
Landers to stage a ground
invasion as well, then try to
take their properties. Repeat
this with whatever other army is
remaining at the end. It may be
a long map thanks to all the
naval warfare.

=================
~~Jab Peninsula~~
=================
Red has the advantage of being
able to reach the middle island
quickly, allowing them to earn a
bigger economy. The other teams
have their own neutral
properties, but nearly enough as
red will get if left alone. Try
and stop red before they get too
far into their capturing. Focus
more on aerial units instead of
a navy for this map. Make some
ground defenses again air units,
have a Submarine or two handy
incase Battleships come towards
your island, and just bide time.

Build up an air force and storm
one of the enemy islands. Each
team gets tons of factories, so
capturing it will be somewhat
difficult. Routing them may be a
better idea if you can't block
their factories. This will be
another long map since all three
types of unit forces can be
built. Do whatever it takes to
counter your opponents.

==============
~~Port Mouth~~
==============
Focus more on ground troops than
a navy. Battleships will help
you midway through the battle on
the perimeter of the island, but
they won't be seeing much use
anywhere else. Make sure to
build plenty of Landers so you
can reach distant islands fairly
quickly. They also work well at
distracting the enemy.

This map is nothing special.
Each side will be able to get a
decent economy, so it could be a
long stalemate throughout the
center of the map. There are a
decent amount of chokepoints, so
try using those to get the enemy
armies to disperse where they
are sending their units. Play a
bit defensively and you could
end up winning. Just push
through to obtain enemy
properties when you know your
forces can overtake the enemy's.

================
~~Shield Hills~~
================
Blue may start with more
properties, but they may find it
hard to advance past the long
chokepoints leading in and out
of their base. Yellow and red
should team up and storm through
blue. Both of them get more
capturable properties, and can
eventually overpower blue.
Working as a team, blue has no
chance of holding both
chokepoints at the same time.

Once blue is gone, teams will
need to capture what used to be
blue's properties quickly. Take
the factories, and that team
will be able to easily destroy
any remaining forces, as well as
have great chance of invading
the last players' base.

=================
~~Thorn Islands~~
=================
None of the islands are
connected, so it's another
air/naval battle. Aerial units,
as always, are the preferred
method of attacking. This map
isn't any different than other
air/naval maps. Just capture a
ton of properties, amass an army
and go around to enemy occupied
islands and take their cities
away from them if undefended.
Even if they are somewhat
defended, a Bomber squadron
should easily take them down.

Just go around the islands in
this pattern, being sure to
defend your own islands. Once
ready, assault an enemy's base.
Bring Landers for ground
support, destroying any Anti-
Airs the enemy has. This process
will also work with whoever is
remaining.

==============
~~Fork River~~
==============
Yellow has one less city that
can be captured than the other
teams, so they are at a slight
disadvantage. Most of this map
is full of plains, so nothing
particuarly interesting will
occur in the battle. Use the
bridges between bases as
chokepoints as you establish an
army, and prevent the enemy
bases from trying to get your
cities. You'll need to push into
their bases and capture their
cities. This is especially
important for yellow-- they need
an advantage. There aren't any
special qualities about this
map. Remember to use
Infantry/Mechs to distract
chokepoint holders--they can
cross rivers, after all.

=================
~~Power Balance~~
=================
Starting Units--Infantry

Despite the map title, each base
gets a similar amount of neutral
properties. Blue is in trouble,
though, since most are far away
from the HQ. Get a factory and
plenty of Bikes out in order to
capture properties quickly.
Afterwards, focus on creating an
air armada, eventually fighting
between another base. Like all
maps, take the enemy cities once
you are finished, then move on
to the last base. It may take
some time to form a large enough
air force to invade the enemy,
and beware of Cruisers that are
guarding the lakeshore--they can
decimate air squadrons real fast
here.

============
~~Triskeli~~
============
Starting Units--Infantry

This is a large map, and you
only start with a single
Infantry, so it is going to take
quite a while. Get a port
immidiately and go for the
center airports. If you can get
those, you will have a huge
advantage on the map. If not,
then you'll need to focus on a
navy. Make Battleships and
prepare to invade the enemy base
that captured the airports. You
want them eliminated as soon as
possible.

If you can get them out of the
match, it will be a bit more
fair it neither of the remaining
teams can capture those
airports. Otherwise, like
before, whoever does will likely
end up winning the map. Play
offensively throughout the
entire map in order to outlast
your opponents.

------------------
~5D.4 Player Maps~
------------------
Finally, there are the 4 Player
Maps. These have four armies
pitted against each other, and
many maps usually have one
defining property that, if
captured, gives that team the
advantage to beat the remaining
teams. Some teamwork will be
required to take down strong
foe's, so make temporary
alliances if needed. Online,
these maps can only be played on
in friend matches.

================
~~Tournament 1~~
================
Starting Units--3 Infantry, War
Tanks, Anti-Tank, Lander

Red and yellow have the
advantage on this map. They can
rush towards the starting
factories and capture the one
that belongs to their opponent.
With both factories in your
control, taking down the foe
next to you will be fairly
simple. Capture their HQ, then
keep making Tanks and Artillery
as you make your way to the
other base that remains
(provided one of the other bases
was captured as well). Not too
much of challening map, but can
turn into a stalemate if
everyone survives.

================
~~Tournament 2~~
================
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Recon, Tank, Md Tank, War
Tank, Artillery, Anti-Tank,
Flare

There are a bunch of silos on
this map, so get to those
quickly and use them to your
advantage. Try and bombard the
other groups evenly, and keep
your units spread out so not too
many get weakened when the enemy
uses silos. Also stay away from
other foes until every silo is
used; nothing is better than
launching silos at two different
enemies instead of just one.

===============
~~Deep Forest~~
===============
Get the Com Tower nearby your
base as quickly as possible,
then rush for the silos so that
nobody else can use them later
in the battle, where they can
actually hinder you. There are a
ton of forests on this map, so
it makes the roads kinda like
chokepoints. Most units won't be
able to go far through the
forests. Use that to your
advantage, and try to focus on
only one opponent at a time. If
two or three are attacking,
focus on being defensive until
you can spend time attacking
just one of them. If you can own
half the map, you'll be in a
good shape of winning.

=================
~~Marine Battle~~
=================
Starting Units--3 Gunboats, 4
Cruisers, 3 Submarines, 2
Battleships

This is a pretty basic predeploy
map. Use your ships effectively
against the opponent who is
closest to you. Use your
Gunboats to weaken enemy
Cruisers so your Submarines can
pass by relatively unharmed.
Have your Cruisers try and
destroy enemy Submarines before
your Battleships get destroyed
easily. It's basically a
"destroy or be destroyed" map.
You have ports, but it'll take
awhile before you have enough
cash to build anything
worthwhile.

==================
~~Four-Leaf Isle~~
==================
This is a stupid map as the
battle is unlikely to ever get
anywhere. No ships can travel to
the mainland, and a ground
battle is simply impossible. As
far as I can tell, no battle
here will ever finish. It'll
just end in a neverending
stalemate. If ground units are
banned, for whatever reason,
then as for your navy you should
focus on Gunboats and
Submarines. Keep your Gunboats
supplied as often as possible as
you move around the map.

Although, you can use Landers to
drop ground units off on other
parts of the island. Any smart
player will easily destroy
whatever units get dropped down,
or block the beaches with
Infantry to make landing
impossible. As I said, it'll
probably just be a stalemate.

==============
~~Coil Range~~
==============
Starting Units--2 Mechs, Recon,
Tank, War Tank, Artillery, Anti-
Air

Have all of your units head for
the center of the map. There
aren't any chokepoints, so
you'll need to use your weaker
units as shields for your
Artillery if you want to use it
effectively. Conside waiting a
day or two and put your CO
inside the Tank for greater
power on the field. You need to
prevent your HQ from getting
captured, while trying to
capture your opponents HQ's. Go
for the one that's the greatest
threat and has the most units
remaining when everyone collides
in the middle of the map.

==================
~~Missile Garden~~
==================
You'll want to capture
properties quickly in this map.
Try and secure the silos to the
south so they don't end up
hurting you later in the battle.
This will likely be a long
battle as each team sends
streams of units to the center
of the map, trying to get the
most properties and killing each
other along the way. Try
sticking back a bit and building
a more formidable army before
invading the center.

Alternatively, just go along the
outskirts of the map and invade
another base directly instead of
interfering with the center.
You'll have a decent chance of
success if you do that.

===============
~~Cross Isles~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Lander

You've only got a few
properties, so make use of that
Lander and Infantry and go
capture a lot more. This will be
a long battle, and it'll
eventually divulge into being a
naval battle. There are a ton of
properties, so you should be
able to amass a huge, powerful
navy using the many ports that
this map offers you. There's
nothing else specific about this
map. You should know decent
naval warfare, so just make sure
you can counter what your foes
are making, provided this isn't
Fog of War.

================
~~Obstacle Map~~
================
This is a pretty boring map. You
have only a factory and airport,
and many lakes, fires, and
plasma walls block the path.
Form a small airforce, then try
and take over the airport that
belong to the enemy adjacent of
you. By taking that, you can
take their factory, and they
basically have no chance of
winning at that point. Nothing
special about this map either,
but you'll want to work quickly
in order to gain a serious
advantage over your competitors.

================
~~Grid Assault~~
================
Starting Units--9 Infantry

There are four sets of silos on
the map. Split your Infantry
forces to the two sets that are
closest to you. You'll want to
weaken enemy Infantry before you
rush for the center of the map.
You don't want your HQ getting
taken, and that's what will end
the map quickly. Not much to say
here. Once the silos are used,
rush the HQ's and try to wall
off capturing Infantry.

=============
~~Vial Cape~~
=============
Rush for the center of the map
and get one of the factories.
Try to capture any of the other
factories that are left
untouched by the other
competitors. If you can't do
that, fight for them while
capturing cities. They are
pretty important to dominate the
map. Whoever gets control of the
center will easily win this map.
Keep sending units down there,
and keep building from the
factory in the center. Anti-
Tanks are always useful, and
even Mechs will have their use.
Just never let the factory get
blocked, or you'll be in
trouble.

==================
~~Whirlpool Isle~~
==================
Starting Units--Infantry

Rush to the center of the map
and capture a factory. It's
unlikely any team will capture
the airport for a while. This
will be a boring map as nobody
has any other cities to capture.
Spam Mechs from the center
factory you capture and try to
take over another factory next
to you. If you can control two
of them, you'll likely capture
the airport. If you can do that,
making B Copters will easily be
the key to victory. Be sure to
hurry, or those factories are
going to be taken.

===============
~~Tangled Web~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Tank, Artillery, Rig

All teams should head for the
center factory. It'll be
difficult for anybody to
actually capture it, and all
teams will probably kill each
others Infantry and Mech before
that can happen. There's not
much to this map. There may be a
chokepoint at almost every point
on the map, but with only one
Artillery, you can't do much
with them. Use your Tank
effectively by putting your CO
in it, then play a little
defensively.

===============
~~Battle Cube~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Tank, War Tank, Anti-Air,
Artillery, Missiles, Rockets,
Rig, Lander, Submarine, Cruiser,
Battleship, T Copter, 2 B
Copters, Fighter, Bomber

For this map, you'll want to
capture everyone's HQ to end the
battle pretty quickly. To do
this, you'll need make effective
use of all of your units.
Destroy major threats, like the
Battleships and all enemy air
forces. You may want to play a
bit defensively and let other
teams injure themselves,
allowing you to mooch off of
their work a bit easier. Make a
mix between taking your time and
rushing, and don't be afraid to
retreat until you're safe to
capture the HQ's. Sacrifice
weaker units if you have to, as
well.

=============
~~Crossroad~~
=============
Starting Units--2 Infantry, 3
Bikes, 2 Rockets, Rig, 2
Battleships, 2 Submarines, 2
Cruisers, 2 Landers, 2 T
Copters, 2 B Copters, 2
Fighters, 2 Bombers

This may be a bit of a hectic
map. Keep your land units back
and use your aerial and naval
units to sink the enemy navies
and air forces. You need to
split them up and destroy the
two foes that are to the sides
of you. Continue attacking,
playing it safe if necessary,
until they are wiped out. Try to
minimalize casualites if at all
possible.

Once an enemy navy and air force
is demolished, rushing them with
your own aerial units will
destroy the few ground units
that they start with. Once one
team has been killed, focus on
destroying another team,
preferable the other team that
starts adjacent to you. Continue
this pattern with the final
team, who is likely as weak, if
not weaker, than your remaining
forces. If you didn't lose too
many units, you can easily
overrun them for a victory.

================
~~Four Corners~~
================
All teams need to secure
properties around them, but at
the most need to rush for the
airport in the center. Whoever
gets it will have quite the
advantage in this map. Try
getting it yourself, and in the
middle of the brawl, try
sneaking into one of the other
teams' base and park something
on their factory, using a few
Tanks. From there, you can
capture their HQ. You shouldn't
have to worry about funds after
that, and the airport will seem
less significant if you haven't
gotten it.

But you should get it eventually
as you want control of the
center of the map. With a ton of
properties, Tank spam, and put
an Anti-Air next to the airport
to render it worthless. With the
center in your control, invading
the remaining bases should prove
easy, unless they team up on
you. End the battle quickly if
they appear to be doing that.

==================
~~Division Range~~
==================
Get a large economy going, then
keep sending Tanks to defend you
cities, as well as trying to
overtake an enemy base. Red
should get blue, abusing the
chokepoint to the south, while
yellow and black fight it out in
a chokepoint-less area. It's a
pretty basic map, but you'll
find constantly moving Tanks to
reach your enemy gets quite
annoying. Nothing can really be
done about this until you
overrun one of the enemy bases.
Then things will finally get
easier.

============
~~Island X~~
============
This map will quickly turn into
an aerial battle, with a decent
amount of ground support. Get
the factories near the middle of
the map quickly, then defend the
chokepoints. Get some Dusters
and Fighters out on the field to
take down any aerial opposition,
and make some temporary airports
to aid you in conquest. Focus on
pushing through one chokepoint
and taking an enemy base for
your own. Use as many aerial
units as possible for backup.
You can also try using Landers
to add even more pressure. Make
one base crumble, and you can
finish the remaining two off
with huge economic prowess.

==============
~~Crop River~~
==============
There is little chance for
anyone other than black to be
winning this map. They start
with a ton of properties, and
can capture a lot more. All of
the teams should use river
chokepoints to try and stall
whoever is attacking them while
they build a bigger army. Black
should try and keep their early
advantage by dominating one of
the neighboring bases, only
ensuring an easy victory. The
other three teams should try
ganging up on black and taking
it down, before the reverse
happens to them.

==============
~~Inner Isle~~
==============
Teams should not focus much on a
ground battle. Stick a Recon on
your HQ to keep it safe from
possible Infantry rushes, but
focus on nabbing the center
island, as well as a naval
battle. Try and secure half of
the seas so you can destroy an
opponents base using several
Landers loaded with Tanks, and
possible a Bike if you want to
attempt an HQ capture. Or you
can capture one of their
factories to make them focus on
ground troops for a while.
That's also an effective way of
finishing an opponent off.
Repeat this process with the
other two bases, who will have
likely injured themselves in the
interim, and you can win this
mission.

=================
~~Rival Islands~~
=================
Focus on defeating your
adversary on your island rather
than the other island. There are
no chokepoints, so keep on using
Tanks, and make a Battleship
every now and then to assist
your ground troops. Just be
aware of enemy Submarines
that'll try destroying it. Once
you take over your entire
island, you can win the map
easily if neither teams on the
other island has won control. If
so, then rush through one base,
capture it, and use the might of
you economy, three times that of
your last foe, to destroy them.

If the other island is
completely owned, then it'll be
stuck to mainly a naval battle.
Nothing special about one of
those. Try to land on the enemy
island with some Landers if you
ever get the oppertunity. Have
Cruiser and Submarines escort
it.

==============
~~Plus Canal~~
==============
There aren't many properties to
obtain, so you'll be stuck at
defending your territory by
using the various chokepoints
around your base. Like all maps,
try and push your way through
one of the chokepoints (your
best bet would be the one with
the weakest opposition), then
try and capture their HQ. That
shouldn't be too hard--the HQ's
are placed near the chokepoints.
Guarded by rivers and mountains,
you can sneak Mechs over pretty
quickly if you wish.

==============
~~Quad Isles~~
==============
Focus on trying to secure one of
the islands on the corners of
the map. Get the airport first
so you can defend it from any
other assaults early in the map,
then get the cities. Past this
point, most of the map will just
be the various teams assaulting
each other using the bridges,
with Bomber support to try and
break up the chokepoints. Not
much else notable for this map.
Quickly take down a base to have
an early advanatage, otherwise
you're in for a long battle.

================
~~Patriot Cove~~
================
This may also be a long map. Red
has one additional property, but
it's neglible in the long run.
Try and get the airport on the
center island as quickly as
possible. You should use some
Cruisers in order to make some
enemy air units back away from
yours, but otherwise you should
just stick to an air force. Try
not to spend much money on
Fighters, instead buying
Dusters. They're effective on
this map. Use B Copters as well
for any ground troops you come
across, and try to invade a base
and take it over. Repeat that
for the remaining bases until
you clear the map. Destroy all
threats immidately so your air
force can move unimposed.

===============
~~Chain Canal~~
===============
Getting command of the center
island is critical to winning
this mission. It doesn't have to
happen right away, but you'll
need to get on that eventually.
The factories on the island are
important. You can use them to
injure anything else produced on
the island, and eventually
capture said properties.

Like other maps, form an air
force and push through one of
the enemy bases. Due to the
numerable amount of properties,
attempt an HQ capture so you can
easily dominate with a strong
economy. Make Battleships and
Cruisers to assist your units in
the push through an enemy base.
They are also good at deterring
enemy air units.

================
~~Spring Lakes~~
================
This is a huge map, and everyone
starts with few properties. Do
whatever it takes to obtain
factories elsewhere on the map,
especially the center. Try to
mass an army of Tanks, then head
straight for the nearest base.
You will want to be careful--
there are no chokepoints you can
use to your advantage unless you
cross over the center of the
map. Speaking of which, the
factory there is a crucial point
of this mission. Try capturing
it. Otherwise, ignore it for a
while and manuver around it on
your conquest to destroy all
enemy bases. Once you fall one
base, you should have a strong
enough economy to take that
factory, securing a victory in
the map.

================
~~Grand Battle~~
================
Starting Units--2 Infantry,
Mech, Recon, 3 Artillery,
Rockets, 2 Anti- Tanks, Rig, 6
Landers

Not so much a "grand" battle,
exactly. You'll want to capture
the enemy HQ's due to the
annoying nature of this map.
You're given a ton of Landers
with which to accomplish this
mission. Make sure that you land
in safe areas, avoiding being
attacked by Rockets and the
Anti-Tanks. Once you land your
Artilleries and Infantry safely
down, Destroy any enemy
occupation in the area. As for
yourself, keep an Anti-Tank and
Mech behind to defend your own
HQ. You don't want to have your
plans get foiled by them being
used on you.

===============
~~Leafy Haven~~
===============
Starting Units--Infantry, Mech,
Bike, Recon, Anti-Air, Tank, War
Tank, Artillery, Rockets, Rig

Try and get most of your units
onto the roads. This will take a
long time for your Bike, Recon,
and Rockets, so they'll be
pretty useless for this map.
Capture the HQ your units start
close to, then try to defend
your HQ from capture, which
should be relatively closeby.
There's not much to this map, so
use your units efficiently and
try not to lose over a simple HQ
capture.

================
~~Four Forests~~
================
Starting Units--Infantry

This will be an insanely long
map as you all start with almost
no properties. Get Bikes on the
field and start capturing.
You'll want the airports, and
the factory at the center of the
map is insanely useful. It will
take some time for a good
economy to flow in, and
afterwards you should focus on
building an army with plenty of
indirects, especially in Fog of
War.

Try to slowly push into one
base, using the defense of the
forests to keep as many of your
units alive as possible. Once
one of the bases is overrun with
Bombers and Tanks, you should
own about half of the map. As
with any other battle, this will
balance the map in your favor.
Should make for an easy victory.

================
~~Mountain Map~~
================
Starting Units--Infantry

This map is similar to Four
Forests. It will take quite a
while before any significant
action occurs, and lots of
action may never happen. Almost
the entire map is a giant
chokepoint, so it will take
forever and then some to push
into a single base. If anything,
control the center properties,
and send Mechs over the
mountains to distract enemies in
the chokepoints.

Nothing can really be said here.
You're restricted to ground
units, and they really hurts
with how annoying the
chokepoints are. Rockets will be
insanely useful here as you try
to push into an enemy base. Once
you capture one, build strong
units to try and push far into
another base's chokepoint. It
will be a long map, possibly
even resulting in a stalemate.

================================
     ~6.The War Room--Tactical
     Advice~
================================
Want some advice on how to
improve your game? Basic
techniques all players should
follow can be found in this
section. Most of these should be
fairly obvious to veterans, but
if you are nowhere near as good
as them, following these tips
will be a start to improving
yourself.

1.Never build higher than Tanks

Yeah, I know that Medium Tanks
are pretty strong. Big whoop. A
unit isn't judged by the amount
of damage it can deal/take, but
rather the cost effectiveness of
it. Tanks are extremely cheap,
do decent damage to all units it
can attack, have pretty good
defense, and larger movement
than most other units.

War Tanks have only four
movement. They can't sit outside
a Rockets' range and attack them
next turn. Regular Tanks can.
Not to mention that four
movement means it takes War
Tanks about 33% longer to reach
their destination, but not for
normal Tanks. Also, regular
Tanks can destroy Medium Tanks,
and as for War Tanks, that's
what Anti-Tanks were made to
take care of.

Units to build:
Infantry/Mechs/Bikes (map
dependant on which ones are most
effective at their jobs), Recons
(capture interruptor), Flares
(Fog of War mainly, but powerful
capture interruptors on maps
where Recons can reach
destinations quickly), Tanks,
Artillery (highly cost effective
if protected), Anti-Tank (only
if enemy is spamming higher
level Tanks like crazy)

Naval and air units are
different. There are only a few
of each, so it's good to balance
between them all. Don't spam
expensive Battleships or Bombers
--a few are good, but spamming
them is wasting money. Both are
more than easily countered by
cheaper units.

2.Use chokepoints to your
  advantage

Many maps have at least one
chokepoint in them. A
chokepoint, if you don't know,
is a thin spot on the map where
units can only pass through
single- file. If you put a unit
in a chokepoint, it's basically
a wall against enemy units.

This also works to your
advantage if used correctly.
Block the chokepoint with a
strong units, then place an
Artillery or two behind it.
Since the enemy can't attack
your Artillery, you're free to
bombard their units from a safe
distance.

But be careful if the enemy has
Artillery of their own. If
possible, make a Rockets to
destroy enemy Artillery,
otherwise pull out of the
chokepoint if you don't have
many, if any, Artillery. On maps
with air units, chokepoints
aren't too useful. Bombers can
just go around the clogged area,
attacking enemy Artillery
easily.

3.Keep producing

On maps with a bunch of
factories, it is best to
constantly produce things every
turn. At the least you should
keep building Infantry. They
make cheap and effective
meatshields, especially useful
in chokepoints. Saving up cash
is only useful on naval/air
dominant maps. After all, the
most expensive unit you should
be making is Tanks, with the
exception of Anti- Tanks every
now and then.

Outproducing your enemy is key.
Having more units is not always
better, but it's unit placement
that can seriously help. There's
no need to use this tactic on
huge maps, but for smaller maps,
it's quite useful.

4.Understand property advantages

By this, I mean which ones you
should put effort into securing
as quickly as possible, and
which ones you can take awhile
to capturing. You obviously want
as large of an economy as
possible, and getting far away
cities that will become
difficult to capture later is
key.

Also rush for any distant
production facility. After all,
they are capable of defending
themselves, and can pay off in
the long run. Ports aren't
nearly as important as airports
and factories are. Keep that in
mind.

Finally, there's capturing
disruption. You're out and about
the map, trying to secure
properties. Why not mess with
your opponent? Making several
Recons for the sole purpose of
delaying, if not destroying,
enemy Infantry and stalling
their capturing is always
advised, unless you are on a
huge map or doing this is
impossible (large sea prevents
access to enemy base, for
example). Use Flares instead if
there are many plains or forests
in the way to the enemy base. In
such cases, Flares move faster
than Recons, and will be more
useful.

Remember that your opponent will
likely do this in return! Escort
Infantry with a Recon, or even a
Tank, to minimize harassing
attempts. Securing properties,
far away properties, and
delaying your opponent are vital
to early-game matches.

5.Strategies differ by map

Finally, every map is different.
It's advised to play on every
map at some point so understand
their advantages, which
properties are worth capturing
early in the match, and what
spots often see the most action.
Sometimes you can merely eyeball
a map from the start to
determine that, but you will be
able to formulate strategies as
you get more experience in non-
campaign battles.

Also of note is that you need to
figure out what units you should
build more of, and if you should
focus on ground, air or naval.
Sometimes it's obvious what you
should build, and other times
you'll only want to build
certain things as counters. It
is never wise to invest in all
three types of units. Always
focus on just one, occasionally
building in another group for
support. If naval units don't
have access to most of the map,
don't build them. If ground
units are trapped by mountains
in most areas, then stick to air
units. Know your maps to
determine what to build and how
to overrun your opponent's base.

================================
        ~7.Design Maps~
================================
As with other Advance Wars,
you're capable of designing your
own maps. For a change, you are
finally able to customize the
size of your map. It can be
anywhere from 5X5 to 30X30.
Also, the amount of buildings
you can place has been knocked
up to 99, but units placable has
been kept at 50 per team.

When creating your own map,
you'll always need to keep aware
of fairness. Of course, this is
for actual competitive maps.
Making gimmicky maps is fine
too, provided all players know
of the stipulations to win.

Concerning competitive maps, a
symmetrical map is rarely a good
idea. Never put a lone building
in the center of the map.
Obviously, whoever goes first is
probably going to capture it,
and whoever does is destined to
win more likely then not.

If you do make a symmetrical
map, avoid first turn advantage.
Whoever goes first gets dibs on
pretty much everything on the
map, and can easily get the
first strike on their foe. This
only applies to small maps,
usually 13X13 or less. Anything
bigger, and first turn advantage
is generally neglible.

To remedy first turn advantage,
there are a variety of options.
You can either give the second
player a predeployed Infantry.
Alternatively, you can give them
a preowned city near red's base
that they will capture pretty
soon, but long enough for blue
to be on even grounds with red.

Also, avoid making maps with an
insane amount of chokepoints.
Having a few is nice, but make
sure there's at least one non-
chokepoint path to and from all
bases on the map. There's no fun
in 100-day stalemates for
control over a single
chokepoint.

Another important aspect of a
map is terrain variety. A map
full of only plains looks
boring, and certainly isn't
going to be interesting in Fog
of War. Conversely, a map full
of woods isn't going to be fun
because it will take twice as
long for vehicles to reach their
targets. Use roads to link bases
to key destinations on the map.
Use rivers or sea tiles to block
off areas from land units, or
use mountains. Mountains should
be placed in areas that will
help players in Fog of War, or
merely to block off travel of
land units.

Finally, there's the properties
themselves. You'll need even
distribution so that all sides
get the same amount of
properties, provided you're not
intentionally giving the
advantage to one player. A
general rule is that there
should be about 4 cities per
unit production facility on the
map. Also, don't forget that Com
Towers now give funds. Radar
stations also give funds as
well. Use Radars in Fog of War
maps, being sure to place them
in strategic positions. Never
make too many properties
"uncapturable". By that, it's
meant that by the time you reach
them, both teams will be waging
war with Tanks, and neither side
will get said properties.
Whoever does will obviously be
the one winning, and those
properties will only help them
win even faster.

These are merely suggestions--
they in no way should dictate
how you create your maps.
They're design maps. You SHOULD
be creative in most of them.

Also, you are capable of
uploading maps over Nintendo
Wifi Connection. Sending them to
the Map Center allows them to be
downloaded at random. You can
only have one map at a time in
the Map Center be available for
download, and the size has to be
10X10 or smaller. Also, you need
to hae played on it and finished
it (set all players so you
control them if you wish;
surrendering will NOT count as
"finishing" a map). People who
recieve the map can play it, and
after finishing can rate it on a
scale of 1 to 5. You can check
the score of your uploaded map
whenever you connect to Wifi.

You can trade maps of any size
with people in your Friend
Roster. Any traded map stays in
your roster, and any recieved
map will take up a vacant save
space that you have.

================================
     ~8.History and Medals~
================================
In the History section, you can
view just how many times you've
done something. How many days
have passed in the game, how
many of each unit you've
produced/killed, and how long
you've played. For passing
certain amounts, you earn a
medal. You can earn up to three
medals for each catagory.
Following is a list of each
achievement, and how many of
each you need to accomplish to
earn all three medals.

Also note the top screen. You're
shown Force, Team, Rank, and
eight huge medals. These are all
have different meanings.

Force is the type of units you
use more often than anything
else. For many players, this is
likely to be ground. Depending
on the maps you prefer to play,
you may end up with Naval or
Air.

Team is the type of unit you've
spent the most money on. If
you've made 200 Infantry and 200
Bombers, you'll be in the Bomber
Squdron as you've spent far more
on them than you have Infantry.

Rank is merely a colored plate
with stars on it. The more
medals you obtain, the more the
color will change the the more
stars that will appear on the
plate.

There are eight large medals to
obtain. Here's how to get them:
Time Medal--Play the game for 50
hours S Rank Medal--Obtain 50 S
Ranks Units Production Medal--
Obtain a total of 50 medals for
units produced Units Destroyed
Medal--Obtain a total of 50
medals for units destroyed
Multiplayer Medal--Obtain four
medals total in multicard/Wifi
catagories Maps Played Medal--
Play on 150 maps Maps Cleared
Medal--Clear 150 maps Gun Medal
--Obtain five medals total in
Talon Gun/Nest/Meteors destroyed

Here are the three different
catagories of medals, and all of
the various achievements on each
page with the amount you need to
