********************************
Prologue                        
********************************
Early afternoon in Dream Land...

It's so peaceful that the clouds
are even drowsy.

And now it's Kirby's favorite
time of the day-snack time.

Today's yummy snack is a sweet,
fluffy slice of strawberry
shortcake!

Time to dig in...

WHOA! The cake that Kirby was
about to eat has suddenly
vanished!

That scrumptious berry-topped
slice of mouth-watering
goodness...

No doubt about it! This must be
the work of that greedy King
Dedede!

Well, there's no time to waste!
Gotta get that cake back!

And that's how Kirby's latest
fantastic adventure begins...

Extra                           
********************************

Extra mode is the same thing as
the regular story mode, except
that you are timed, and you
cannot save. If you get a
gameover, you'll have to start
all over again, from the
beginning. I haven't gone
through it yet (I don't have the
time), but I would think that
it's not much harder than story
mode.
