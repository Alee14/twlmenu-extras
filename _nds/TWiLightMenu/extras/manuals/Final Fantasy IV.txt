================================
I. Introduction [INTR]
================================

Final Fantasy IV for the
Nintendo DS is the fourth
version of Final Fantasy IV.
From what I've heard, this
version is much more harder than
any other version of Final
Fantasy IV. Final Fantasy IV is
about a dark knight named Cecil.
After stealing Mysidia's
crystal, Cecil started to doubt
their king. His journey to
protect the rest of the world's
crystal then began.

================================
II. Characters [CHR]
================================

Name: Cecil Class: Dark
Knight/Paladin Abilities:
Darkness (Dark Knight), White
Magic, Cover (Paladin) Cecil is
the Captain of the Red Wings.
After his attack on Mysidia, he
started to have doubts about the
king and ended up losing his
title as captain. After he heard
that the new Captain of the Red
Wings are going after the other
town's crystals, he went on a
journey to protect them.

Name: Kain Class: Dragoon
Abilities: Jump Kain is Cecil's
best friend. They both lost
their parents and were adopted
by the king. Kain accompanied
Cecil to the Mist Village after
Cecil lost his title as Captain
of the Red Wings.

Name: Rydia Class: Summoner
Abilities: White Magic, Black
Magic, Summon Rydia is a girl
from the Mist Village. She met
Cecil and Kain when her village
was destroyed. She didn't trust
Cecil at first but she got
closer to him after he protected
her from Baron Soldiers.

Name: Tellah Class: Sage
Abilities: Recall, Black Magic,
White Magic Tellah is a powerful
mage. He met Cecil and Rydia in
the Underground Waterway when
they were on their way to
Damcyan. Tellah asked Cecil for
help to defeat the monster
blocking the way to Damcyan so
he can get to his daughter.

Name: Edward Class: Bard
Abilities: Hide, Salve, Bardsong
Edward is the prince of Damcyan.
He disguised himself as a bard
so he won't catch other people's
attention. Edward is in love
with Tellah's daughter Anna but
he won't approve of their
marriage. Edward joined Cecil
and Rydia to help them save Rosa
when she became ill.

Name: Rosa Class: White Mage
Abilities: Aim, White Magic,
Pray Rosa is a white mage from
Baron. Rosa has a huge crush on
Cecil. The reason she became a
white mage was because she
wanted to help Cecil. After the
earthquake in Mist, she left
Baron and followed Cecil but she
ended up getting sick in the
Kaipo Desert.

Name: Yang Class: Monk
Abilities: Focus, Kick, Brace
Yang is a monk from Fabul. He's
very well mannered and looks
after the group. He joins Cecil
and the others when he found out
that the Red Wings are after
Fabul's Crystal.

like Yang, Porom is very well
mannered. She joined Cecil when
he went to Mount Ordeals to take
the test to become a Paladin.

Abilities: Twincast, Bluff,
Black Magic Palom is an
apprentice Black Mage from

he has very bad manners. He
joined Cecil when he went to
Mount Ordeals to take the test
to become a Paladin.

is the airship engineer of
Baron. Cid joined Cecil to help
rescue Rosa and to protect the
overworld's final crystal.

Name: Edge Class: Ninja

Eblan. Edge is very hot headed
and does not act like a prince
at all. He joined Cecil and the
others when they were about to
retrieve the crystals in the
Tower of Babil. Edge joined them
so he can avenge his parent's
death.

Name: Fusoya Class: Lunarian
Abilities: Bless, White Magic,
Black Magic Fusoya is a
lunarian. There's not much to
say about him. He joined Cecil
for a short time to help stop
the Giant of Babil.

================================
III. Walkthrough [WKTR]
================================

The game starts with a scene
with the Red Wings. You will be
then sent to a battle with 2
Floating Eyes. This battle is
pretty easy. Just attack them
normally or you can use your
item, Red Fang, to kill them
with one hit. After the scene
you will end up in Baron Castle

-------------------------------
Baron Castle [WKTR01]
-------------------------------
Items: *Carnelian Signet, 480
gil, Ether, Tent

Once you have control of Cecil,
go to the right and talk to Kain
for a quick scene. Now head back
and exit south.

Continue south and then east
when you can. Examine the yellow
circle on the wall to open a
hidden room. There are three
treasure chests in here. Now go
to the west and go up the
stairs. Follow the path and you
will get into a scene with Rosa.
Now exit this room and then head
north. Another scene will occur
when you get close to the door
to the north. After the scene,
enter the door to the left.

Talk to the rabbit in here and
he'll tell you that his name is
Namingway. Previous FFIV players
should know who he is.
Unfortunately, Namingway can't
change your name on this version
of FFIV. After you talk to him,
head upstairs to your room.
Examine your bed and rest for
the night to activate a scene.

After the scene, you will end up
outside Baron Castle. Enter the
town right below Baron Castle.

Baron [WKTR02]

Items: Potion x4, Gnomish Bread,
Tent x2, Eye Drops, Bronze
Hourglass,

Tent                 100 gil
Bestiary              50 gil
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.

Start by examining the bush to
the right of the Inn for a
potion. Go inside the Inn and
examine the pot to the left of
the entrance for another potion.
Now go upstairs and examine the
yellow circle on the wall. A
hidden room will open up
containing three treasure
chests.

Go back outside and examine the
pot and bush near the house
north of the inn. Now enter the
building to the west of this
house and go downstairs. If this
is your first time playing FFIV
then you should talk to everyone
here because they'll tell you
the controls and some other info
in the game such as running away
from battle, etc.

Now go back to the house to the
north of the inn and cross the
bridge to the north. Go up the
stairs and you'll find a dancer.
To her left is a staircase
leading to the water. Go down
the waterfall and follow the
path all the way to the end.
There are two hidden treasure
chests here.

Go back to the dancer. Go back
downstairs and then head east,
then north. If you find an old
lady here then you're in the
right place. Now head west by
going behind the town (Be
careful not to exit the town).
Now head all the way to the west
(don't exit town) and examine
the big bush (or is it a tree?)
behind the wall to get a phoenix
down. Now examine the wall
behind the weapon/armor shop for
another phoenix down.

That's all the items in this
town, you're free to explore the
town and do some shopping. When
you're done, exit the town and
then head all the way to the
west and then north to find the
Mist Cave.

-------------------------------
Mist Cave [WKTR03]
-------------------------------
Monsters: Eyewing Moth, Larva,
Sword Rat, *Mist Dragon Items:
Potion x2, Eye Drops, Tent Map
Completion: Potion x5 My Party:
Cecil Lv. 11 Kain Lv. 10

A scene with Namingway will
occur when you enter. After the
scene, just follow the path
until another scene occurs. Go
up the stairs and get the
treasure chest containing a
potion. Now head east and then
go up the stairs there to get a
treasure chest containing eye
drops. Now head south down the
stairs to get a treasure chest
containing a tent. Now go back
up the stairs and head east.
Just follow the path until you
find the boss.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Mist Dragon
Weak: Dark

This is the first boss so it
should be pretty easy. Cecil's
weapon is a dark type so it
should deal big damage to the
dragon. You can use darkness for
extra damage but it's not really
needed. Kain should just use
jump. Don't attack the Mist
Dragon when it turns into mist.
It'll counter attack with Cold
Mist that hits both Cecil and
Kain. Wait for it to return to
dragon form and then attack
again.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the battle, exit the cave
north. Head east to enter the
Mist Village.

-------------------------------
Mist [WKTR04]

will end up back in the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: General

Weak: None

Easy battle. Just kill the Baron
Soldiers and the General will
retreat when they are all dead.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rydia will join after the
battle.

Exit the Inn and head west to
find the Fat Chocobo. When
you're done, enter the
northeastern most house on the
map. Talk to Mappingway and
he'll let you view the bestiary.
Now continue going inside the
house and you'll find Rosa.
She'll give you the Auto-Potion
Augment. Exit the house and
Livingway will explain to you
how to use Augments.

Now do some shopping and then
exit the town. Head northeast to
find the Underground Waterway.
You might want to give Rydia
some more levels before
entering.

get the two chests here. Head
north across the bridge and then
head down the stairs. Now
examine the tentacle for a boss
battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Octomammoth
Weak: Lightning, Dark

This battle is pretty easy. Have
Cecil use darkness and then have
Tellah and Rydia use thunder.
The Octomammoth's attack will
increase for each tentacle that
it loses so you need to be
careful. Make sure to have Rydia
or Tellah use Cura when anyone's
HP gets too low.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now head north to exit the cave.
Head north and enter Damcyan.

-------------------------------
Damcyan [WKTR07]
-------------------------------
Items: Power Bow, Feathered Cap,
Ruby Ring, Eye Drops, Antidote,
Potion,
 Ether, Phoenix Down, Gold

on the wall all the way to the
right. This will open a door.
Now head east to get the three
chests inside the cell. Now go
back and head all the way to the
west and then south. There's a
staircase behind the wall but
you can't see it. There are six
treasure chests here.

the stairs. Now get the chests
to the east and to the west. Now
go back down the stairs and then
head south to the next area.

Just keep going south to start a
boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Antlion
Weak: Ice

This is another easy boss. Have
Cecil use darkness, Rydia cast
blizzard and Edward sing Life's
Anthem. The Antlion will counter
attack depending on the color of
its eye. When it's normal, he'll
counter physical attacks and
when it's red, it'll counter
magic. Cecil probably won't have
too much trouble taking damage
from the Antlion's counter but
Rydia might have a bit of
trouble. Just heal her when she
is countered so she doesn't die.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can walk back outside
the Antlion's Den or you can use
an emergency exit, its up to
you. Head back to Kaipo.

-------------------------------
Kaipo [WKTR09]
-------------------------------
Items: *Item Lore Augment

Go to Rosa and use the Sand
Pearl on her. A scene will
occur. Rosa will join your
party. Another scene will occur
and a battle will start. You'll
only have Edward for this
battle. Just attack the enemy it
he'll eventually die.

Once you have control over Cecil
again, equip the Power Bow you
got in Damcyan on Rosa and go
buy an iron arrow in the Weapon
Shop and then equip it on Rosa.
There is a new training you can
do with Whyt so go to the Fat
Chocobo if you want to do it.
Now head north from the Inn and
you should see something
sparkling between the two trees.
Examine it to get the Item Lore
Augment.

When you're ready, head east
from the Antlion's Den and
you'll find Mount Hobs.

-------------------------------
Mount Hobs [WKTR10]

Map - Bomb Core x3 My Party:
Cecil Lv. 20 Rydia Lv. 19 Edward
Lv. 16 Rosa Lv. 15

Examine the block of ice and a
scene will occur. Rydia will
learn Fire. Now head all the way
up the mountain and enter the
room to the left. Now go to the
west and you'll find a save
point. Continue south and then
east to find four chests. Now go
back to the first map. Head east
and enter the room to the right.

Head east and grab the chest.
Now head north to start a boss
battle. For the first battle,
Yang will be alone. Just let him
use kick and all the enemies
should die. Now it's time for
the boss.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Mom Bomb (Bomb x3, Gray
Bomb x3) Weak: Ice, Dark

This battle is a bit tougher
than the others. Have Cecil
attack, he's dark weapon should
deal good damage against Mom
Bomb but if you want you can
still use darkness for double
damage. Have Yang use focus and
then attack, Rydia use blizzard,
Rosa supports with cura and
protect and have Edward attack
normally or help out with the
healing using items or salve.
Don't use life's anthem because
he won't be able to defend
later. When Yang warns you that
Mom Bomb is about to use a
strong attack, have everyone use
Defend. This attack will deal
major damage that can instantly
kill your party.

When the Mom Bomb explodes, it
will turn into three Bombs and
Gray Bombs. Quickly heal
everyone and then have Cecil and
Rosa attack, Yang kick, Rydia
blizzard, and Edward life's
anthem or have him attack
regularly its up to you.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yang will join you after the
battle. Head north to the next
area. Now follow the path down
the mountain.

Once you're back in the
overworld, head east whenever
you can to reach Fabul.

Just keep going right and you'll
get it. Now head to the Inn and
talk to the Inn Owner for a
scene.

Once you're ready, leave Fabul.
You should be able to see a boat
just north of Fabul. Once you
enter, everyone in your party
will leave so remove their
equipment. When you're ready,
get on the boat. You will
receive the counter augment from
Yang's Wife.

After the scene, head east and
enter the town.

Be careful when talking to the
townspeople here. They all hate
Cecil since he attacked the
village and stole their crystal.
Avoid talking to the black mage
near the entrance, the black
mage at the counter at the Inn
and the dancer. They will turn
Cecil into a toad, a pig, or
inflict poison. The other
townspeople are safe to talk to.
When you're done exploring the
town, head north and enter the
building there.

Approach the Elder and a scene
will occur. Palom and Porom will
join your party. Once you have
Palom and Porom in your party,
it should be safe to talk to the
black mages. The dancer will
continue to turn you to a pig
when you talk to her.

If you have the money, go to the
Armor Shop and buy the Lustrous
Shield, Lustrous Helm, Knight's
Armor and Gauntlets. No one in
your party can use them yet but
you will need them later. If you
don't have the money, sell all
the Dark Knight equips that you
are not using and sell Edward's
harp. If you still don't have
enough then you can just buy
them all later or if you have
the patience, you can fight some
battles to earn money. Buy at
least two of the equipment I
mentioned.

When you're ready, exit Mysidia
and head east. Follow the path
and you'll end up in Mount
Ordeals. Before you enter Mount
Ordeals, you might want to give
Porom and Palom some levels
first. Their level starts off
way too low. If you're leveling
around in Mount Ordeals and you
need to recover your party's
health, just head south and
you'll find a Chocobo Forest.
Heal everyone with Porom's cura
magic to restore their HP and
then catch a white chocobo to
restore everyone's MP. You will
also find Recordingway here in
the Chocobo Forest. Talk to him
and he'll ask if you can lend
him some of your tent, say yes.
He'll take ALL of your tent so I
hope you bought some Cottages in
Mysidia. You can now view events
by talking to the Fat Chocobo.

When you're ready, enter Mount
Ordeals.

Head west and get close to the
wall of fire. A scene will
occur. After the scene, just
follow the path up the mountain.
On the next area, continue
following the path up and a
scene should occur. Tellah will
rejoin your party. Now head
north to the next area.

Go all the way to the left to
find a treasure chest containing
ether. Now go back and head
north and then head east. Go
upstairs and follow the path
west. Head south when you can
and you'll find a chest
containing ether. Head back
north and continue west to the
next area.

Head south and a short scene
should occur. Now head east and
then north and then east again
across the bridge to find a save
point. Now go back west across
the bridge and continue north
for a boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Scarmiglione
	Skulnant x4
Weak: Fire

Have Cecil attack Scarmiglione,
have Porom and Tellah cast cura
on all the enemies, and Palom
cast fira on all the enemies. If
Scarmiglione's thunder magic is
giving you a hard time then have
Porom cast shell on the party.
This battle is pretty easy.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There will be another boss
battle after this so if you
want, you can go back to the
save point and heal. Continue
west across the bridge and
another boss battle will start.
This battle will be a back
attack so make sure to switch
everyone's positions in the
Party Menu.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Scarmiglione
Weak: Fire

This battle will be a lot harder
than the first one. First you
need to be careful of
Scarmiglione's counter against
magic, gas. It inflicts status
effects on everyone in your
party. Have Porom and Tellah use
cura on Scarmiglione since he
doesn't counter healing spells.
Since they'll be busy with
healing, have Palom heal using
potions. Don't let Palom use any
black magic because it will be
countered by gas. Have Cecil
attack normally and heal if
necessary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now head left and examine the
tombstone. Watch the scene.
Cecil is now a Paladin YAY! A
battle will start.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Dark Knight
Weak: ??

You will only use Cecil for this
fight. Just do nothing and
defend in this battle and you'll
win.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Watch the scene. After the
scene, equip Cecil with the
Lustrous Shield, Lustrous Helm,
Knight's Armor and Gauntlets.
Notice that Cecil is back to
level
1. Walk back down the mountain
   and get Cecil some levels.
   Pay attention on your
way down. When you see something
sparkling, examine it to get the
Curse Augment. Now head back to
Mysidia.

Go inside the Inn. Go up the

start.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Baron Guardsman x2
Weak:

This battle is pretty easy. The
Guardsman will counter with Mini
if you attack them physically
and counter with Pig if you use
magic. Have Cecil attack, Porom
use protect and support with
Cure if needed, and have Tellah
and Palom use magic. If Cecil is
countered by mini, just attack
the enemy again and they'll use
mini on Cecil again returning
him back to normal size. Pig
shouldn't be a problem. If you
use magic on both guards,
they'll both counter Palom or
Tellah with pig returning them
back to humans.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is another battle after
this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Monk
Weak: None

This battle is easy. Have Cecil
or Porom cast protect on the
party and then have Tellah and
Palom use magic.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A scene will occur. Yang will
rejoin your party. You will
receive the Baron Key from Yang.
With this, you can open the
Weapon/Armor shop. You'll find
Campingway in the Weapon/Armor
shop. He will let you listen to
the game's music! When you're
done, go to the box located at
the bottom right. Go down and
you'll find a hidden path.
Follow it to get the treasure
chests behind the weapon and
armor shop owners. When you're

Start by heading east to get the
treasure chest you see on your
map. Now head downstairs to the
next area. Now head all the way
to the south and then head west
to find three chests. Head north
and follow the path to the next
area.

Go down the stairs and then head
south. When you can't move south
anymore, head west. Go up the
stairs to the north to find a
chest containing a bronze
hourglass. Now head south and
you'll find a hidden path. Head
east when you can't continue
south. Go up the stairs to the
north to find another chest. Now
go back to the entrance but do
not go up the stairs. From here,
head east to find a hidden path.
Continue heading east and then
head south when you can. Go up
the stairs to get the treasure
chest. Head south again and
you'll find another hidden path.
Head east and then follow the
path north to the next area.

Head north and go up the stairs.
Now head west to find a hidden
room with a chest containing
ether. Head back to the east and
go north to the next area. Head
west and enter the room. There
is a save point. Don't bother
using your tent or cottage here.
Head east and you'll find a
hidden path. Follow it for an
Ancient Sword. Now leave the
save point room and head east.
Follow the path north and you'll
end up in Baron Castle.

	    Yang   Lv. 22

Head south all the way, east a
bit, and then north. Go to
Cecil's room and examine his
bed. You can get some rest here
to recover HP and MP. Now go
back and head for the throne
room. On your way there, a boss
battle will start.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Baigan
	Left Arm
	Right Arm
Weak: Ice

This battle shouldn't be too
hard. Just target Baigan and
ignore the arms. Baigan will
resurrect them if they die. Have
Cecil attack normally, Yang use
focus and then attack, Porom
support with protect and cura,
and then make sure to get Tellah
to use blizzaga on Baigan and
don't let Palom use any magic.
Baigan will counter with reflect
if he is hit by magic.

Once Baigan have reflect up, the
only way you can hit him with
magic is to have Tellah use
reflect on one of your party and
then have Palom use blizzara and
Tellah use blizzaga on him or
her. Now make sure not to use
cura or protect on your party
member with reflect on. Once
Baigan dies, the two arms will
self-destruct dealing major
damage to one of your party.
There is a much better way to
defeat Baigan

********************************
Thanks to XCPLeprechaun for this
info

Have Tellah use Blizzaga on
Baigan and then have Palom and
Porom use twincast. Twincast
isn't affected by reflect so you
don't have to worry about it.
Twincast also destroys both of
Baigan's arms so you don't have
to worry about self-destruct
killing anyone in your party.
********************************

If I remember correctly, the
twincast flare is affected by
reflect but comet isn't. I don't
really know since I've never
used twincast on this version of
FFIV. I've only tried it in the
previous versions of FFIV.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before continuing to the throne
room, head east. Head east again
on the next area and then head
south. Head west when you can
and you'll find an open door.
Enter to get the six treasure
chests on your map. Now go back
and continue south to the next
area.

Head north and enter the tower.
Grab the four chests. Head
downstairs and examine the
candle on the wall all the way
to the left. You'll find an
elixir. Go back up the stairs
and then go up the stairs to the
east. Grab the two chests and
then go up the stairs to the
left. Grab the three chests
here. Go back to Cecil's room
and restore your HP and MP. Now
go to the throne room for
another boss.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Cagnazzo Weak: Ice
(Lightning: only when water
surrounds him)

Have Cecil attack this guy
normally, Yang use focus and
then attack, have Porom support
with protect and cura, Tellah
and Palom blizzaga and blizzara.
When Cagnazzo is hit by magic,
he will counter with silence so
have Porom heal them using esuna
or echo herbs. If Cagnazzo
inflict sleep on Tellah or Palom
then wake them up ASAP. They're
really important in this battle.
Have Porom use esuna on them or
attack them to wake them up.

When water starts to surround
Cagnazzo, he is about to use his
strongest attack, tsunami. Have
Tellah and Palom use their
strongest thunder magic before
Cagnazzo unleashes his attack.
When Cagnazzo hides in his
shell, he is about to use heal.
It only restores a small amount
of his HP so it isn't really a
problem. His defense also
increases so Cecil's and Yang's
attacks will deal less damage.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A scene will occur after the
battle. Cid will join the party
and the twins will leave. Now
the next one we will go to is
optional but you should do it if
you want to get the Tsunami
Augment.

A scene will occur when you
enter. Now notice that some (or
maybe all) of your party members
are paralyzed. Using esuna won't
work. The only way to remove it
is by removing any metallic
equipment your party has
equipped. Cecil can't use his
Mythgraven Sword here so remove
it for now.

Before you continue, make sure
that you have the whisperweed.
You can't beat the Dark Elf
without it. If you don't have
it, check the Troia Castle
section [WKTR19] of this

battle. After the scene, equip
everyone with their best
equipment. Metallic equipments
will work now. When you're
ready, talk to the Dark Elf for
the real battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Dark Elf/Dark Dragon
Weak: Fire, Holy

The enemy has two forms. For the
first form, have Cecil cast
protect, attack and heal, Cid
attack, Yang focus and then
attack, Tellah cast shell, haste
on himself and then fira.

For the second form, have Cecil
attack and heal, Cid attack,
Yang focus and then attack and
Tellah cast slow, firaga and
heal when necessary. Be careful
of the Dark Dragon's dark breath
attack. It deals major damage to
everyone in the party. Have
Tellah use curaga to take care
of it. Two hits from firaga
should be able to kill the Dark
Elf.

Tellah's MP is very low so make
sure to heal his MP by using
Osmose or by using ether.

Head north, west and then north
again to find a chest containing
a flame mail. Now head all the
way to the east and then head
north to the next area. Now head
west and then head all the way
to the south. Continue west to
find a chest containing a flame
sword. An enemy will attack you
for opening the chest. Continue
west and then head north. Take
the path to the left to get to
the next area.

Head all the way to the east. It
doesn't matter which path you
take. Follow the path and then
west to the next area. Head
south and then head north the
first time you. Enter the room
to the left first. Follow the
path here to get a chests
containing gaia hammer. Go back
and then enter the middle room.
Follow the path all the way to

chests along the way. Go back
and enter the last room to the

sage's surplice and then go
back. Head back south and then
follow the path east to the next
area.

Head south and then head west
and enter the door. There is a
save point here. Use a tent or
cottage and save the game. Now
leave this room and continue
west for a boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Sandy
	Cindy
	Mindy
Weak: None

The Magus Sisters delta attack
is pretty annoying. Sandy will
always use reflect on Cindy,
Cindy will attack normally and
then Mindy will cast a -ra spell
on Cindy. Since the spell is
bounced back by magic, it will
do more damage than normal.

To beat them, have everyone
focus their attacks on Cindy
first. Cindy will counter attack
if you hit her so be careful.
Have Cecil use protect, attack
normally and heal when needed,
Cid attack, Yang focus and then
attack, and Tellah should use
dispel on Cindy when she has
reflect on so the Magus Sisters
won't be able to use their delta
attack.

Once Cindy dies, the battle will
become easier. Have Cecil and
Cid attack Sandy, Yang kick, and
Tellah use an -aga spell on both
Sandy and Mindy. Have Cecil or
Tellah heal if necessary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go back to the save point and
heal. When you're ready, enter
the room the Magus Sisters were
guarding for a scene. Tellah
will leave your party. After the
scene, you'll see something
sparkling on the ground. Grab it
to get the Recall Augment. If
you gave Tellah 1 - 2 augments,
you will also get the Last Stand
Augment and Fast Talker Augment.
Now talk to Kain for another
scene. Kain and Rosa will join
your party. Now get everyone's
equipment ready and then head
south for another boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Barbariccia
Weak: None

This battle will be tough. Be
careful of Barbariccia's
counter, it deals big damage to
everyone in the party. Have
Cecil and Rosa support with
protect, shell and cura, Yang
use focus and then attack, Cid
attack or support with items and
Kain should jump.

When Barbariccia turns into a
tornado, all attacks won't work
on her except for Kain's jump.
Kain's jump will also turn her
back into her normal form.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Watch the scene. You will then
end up in Baron Castle.

can drop rainbow pudding. The
flan that has a higher chance of
dropping it is the Flan Princess
but you can only find it in the

Head north to enter the castle.

the Item Shop. Now go back and
then head north for a scene. Cid
will leave the party. A boss
battle will start after.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Calcabrina (Calca x3,
Brina x3) Weak: None

This boss has two forms. The
first form will consist of three
Calcas and three Brinas. You
have to kill them all before
they combine and turn into its
second form, Calcabrina. If you
want to complete the bestiary
then you'll have to make the
Calcas and Brinas combine to
Calcabrina.

For the first form, have Cecil
attack and heal, Kain attack,
Yang use kick, and Rosa cast
protect and then heal. The
Calcas and Brinas can counter so
look out for that.

For the second form, have Cecil
attack and heal, Kain jump or
attack, Yang focus and then
attack, and Rosa use slow and
then heal. Calcabrina will split
up and turn back to Calcas and
Brinas if you don't kill her
fast enough.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There will be another boss
battle after the scene.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Golbez
	Shadow Dragon
Weak: ???

For the first part of the
battle, Golbez will use an
attack that will paralyze
everyone in your party. He will
then summon Shadow Dragon to
kill everyone in your party,
except Cecil. Once everyone in
your party is dead, Rydia will
appear to help Cecil. The real
battle will start after that.

Golbez will use barrier shift,
which changes his weakness and
lets him absorb any element that
is not his weakness. Quickly use
a phoenix down and then hi-
potion on everyone in the party.
Then have Cecil or Rosa use
shell, libra and heal if
necessary. Don't let Kain attack
because he is equipped with an
elemental weapon. You can let
him help with the healing by
using potion or he can just do
nothing, its up to you. Have
Yang use focus and then attack.
Rydia should summon an eidolon
that has the same element as
Golbez's weakness.

Once you hit Golbez with his
weakness, he will use barrier
shift again. Have Cecil or Rosa
use libra again and then let
Rydia summon again. Just keep
doing this until Golbez dies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rydia will join the party. After
the scene, exit south and then
go up the stairs to the east.
The Weapon and Armor shop is
here. Buy any equips your party
might need. Now head north and
enter the door between the
weapon and armor shop. Head to
the top right area of this room.
If you gave Puddingway his
rainbow pudding, you will find
him here. Talk to him twice and
you'll end up in a battle with
him. He will give you the Eye
Gouge augment when you beat him.

Now head back to the entrance of
the pub and then head east to
find a hidden path. You will end
up in the Developer's Office.
You can get the Reach Augment
here. Talk to everyone in the
Developer's Office and then go
to the break room and examine
the bookshelf for the Lustful
Lali-Ho. Now go back and head
west. Examine the table and use
the Lustful Lali-Ho. Return to
the break room and there will be
something sparkling on the
ground next to the guy that
looks like Baigan. You can leave
when you're done.

Return to the Weapon and Armor
shop. Head east and go up the
stairs. Grab the chest on the
map to get a Dwarven Axe. Go up
the stairs. Examine the pots to
the left of the staircase
leading up to find bacchus's
wine. Now head up the stairs.
Grab the four chests here. It's

Head all the way to the west to
the next area. Go up the stairs
here. One of the pots at the

wine. Go upstairs. Head left to

potion. Now head south, west,

all the way back to 1F. Go down
the stairs to the left and
you'll end up at the Inn. Go
down the stairs at the top
right. Head east and then north
when you can. Talk to the dwarf
and then enter the room behind
him.

Now just follow the map on your
touch screen to the next area.
Make sure to grab the three
chests here. Head west and go to
the area with a different
colored floor. There is a hidden
item here. Once you got it
continue west to the exit.

to restore your HP and MP.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Doctor/Barnabas-Z Barnabas
(Weak: Lightning) Weak:
Lightning (Barnabas-Z only)

This battle isn't all that
tough. Have Kain and Yang attack
Barnabas. Have Cecil attack
Barnabas and heal if needed.
Have Rosa cast protect, shell
and then heal. Have Rydia cast
thundara. Once you kill
Barnabas, the doctor will turn
into Barnabas-Z. Just use the
same strategy against him. If
you don't beat Barnabas-Z on
time, he will self-destruct,
killing one of your party
members.

You can also kill the doctor
first if you want so you don't
have to deal with Barnabas-Z.
It's up to you how you want to
do it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another battle will start after
this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Dr. Lugae
Weak: Lightning

This fight is very difficult. At
the beginning of the battle, he
will use a skill called Reversal
Gas. It reverses the effects of
all attacks. Pay attention to
your touch screen to find out if
you have the reverse status
effect. If you do, have Rosa use
curaga on Lugae and have Cecil
use Cura. Have Kain and Yang
attack your party or use items
on Lugae. Have Rydia cast magic
to everyone on your party to
heal them. You can try using
Rydia's bio magic so everyone
will end up with the sap status
but the problem with is if the
reverse status wears off, sap
will drain hp to all your party
instead of healing them. It's up
to you whether you should use
bio or not. If you think you can
keep everyone's HP up with sap
on then go for it.

Dr. Lugae should use reversal
gas on your party again. When he
does that, the reverse status
should wear off. Now is the time
to attack normally. Have Cecil
attack and heal when necessary,
Rydia summon Ramuh or cast
thundara, Kain and Yang attacks
and Rosa heal with cura or
curaga.

There is an easier way to beat
Dr.Lugae
********************************
Thanks to TheDarkBlader for this
info

Use an elixir after Dr. Lugae
uses reverse gas to instantly
kill him.
********************************
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the scene, go back to the
save point and save. Return to
B9 in the tower. Once you're
there, head south, west and then
north when you can. Open the
locked door here using Lugae's
Key. You will end up in a battle
with three Goblin Captains. Yang

battle. Now leave the Tower of
Babil for another scene.

battle ends.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Rubicante Weak: Ice (When
not wearing cloak)

Rubicante has to be the hardest
out of all the elemental
archfiends. Rubicante has a
strong magic called inferno,
which deals big damage to
everyone in the party. He also
counters physical attacks by
casting fira on everyone on your
party. Rubicante's cloak also
protects him from his weakness,
ice. So don't use any ice type
attacks on him while he is
wearing his cloak.

Have Cecil and Rosa use protect,
shell and then heal. Rydia
should summon Shiva or use
blizzaga when Rubicante isn't
wearing his cloak and summon
Mist when Rubicante is wearing
his cloak. Have Kain jump and
then have Edge attack normally
when Rubicante has his cloak on
(Rubicante will counter with
fira so get Cecil or Rosa ready
to heal) and then use flood when
Rubicante doesn't have his cloak
on.

Rubicante will use inferno when
he isn't wearing his cloak so
make sure that everyone's HP is
full and they have shell on so
everyone can survive the attack.
Have Rosa ready with curaga or
curaja before he uses inferno.

Grab all the treasure chests you
see on your touch screen. Now go
back to the portal. Head south
down the stairs and go to the
treasure chest. Head north from
here and you'll find a diamond
on the floor. Step on it to warp
to another room. Head north and
grab the four treasure chests
here. Now head back by stepping
on the red portal. If you step
on the blue one, you will be
sent back out the dungeon. Now
head west, north and then east
to find another portal. Step on
it to get to the next area.

There's an Inn, Item Shop,
Weapon Shop and an Armor Shop
here. Make sure to go to the Inn
and get some rest or use the
save point in Whyt's house and
use a tent or cottage. There
will be boss fights here. Go to
the house, west of the Inn/Item
Shop. This is Whyt's house.
There are two treasure chests
here. Get them and save the
game. Now leave the house and
head down the stairs to the
west. You'll find Mopingway
here. Go to talk to him. He will
ask you for the name of the
person you're going out with.
The name you give him will be
used for the ???'s Love Augment.
Go back to Whyt's house and
save.

When you're ready, head south
from here and then enter the
house with a chocobo standing
right next to it. Now just keep
heading down the stairs until
you reach the bottom floor. Talk
to the queen and answer yes. A
boss battle will start.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Asura
Weak: None

This battle may seem hard but
its pretty easy once you know
what to do. Asura will keep
healing herself with curaga so
it's impossible to kill her. She
also has a very powerful counter
attack that can instantly kill
everyone in your party in one
hit (except maybe Cecil). There
is a way to avoid all that.

Have Rosa cast reflect on Asura
so her curaga will hit your
party instead. Now have Edge use
mirage and Rosa cast blink on
everyone else in the party. Once
you're ready, have Rydia summon
dragon. Don't use any other
summon because Asura can absorb
elemental damage. Just keep
doing this and Asura should die.

If you have the draw attacks
augment then you can try using
that. I don't know if it works
against counter because I never
actually tried it. Give it to
Cecil since he probably has the
highest defense in your party.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rydia can now summon Asura. Go
back to Whyt's house and
heal/save. When you're ready, go
back to the library and talk to
the old man and answer yes for
another boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Leviathan
Weak: Lightning

This battle is really difficult.
Leviathan moves really fast. I
can't even cast curaga without
him casting two blizzaras first.
He's deluge attack also deals
big damage to the whole party.

Leviathan will always start off
using deluge. If you're at the
same level as I am, then it
should only be able to kill
Edge. Have Rosa cast slow on
Levithan so he won't constantly
cast blizzara on the party. Have
Cecil and Kain use phoenix down
and potions to heal Edge and
Rydia if she also died. Now use
shell on the party to reduce the
damage from blizzara and
blizzaga.

Once all that is set, have Rydia
summon Ramuh, Edge cast blitz,
Cecil attack and heal, Kain
jump, and Rosa cast haste and
heal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rydia can now summon Leviathan.
You're done with this place now.
Leave and get back on the
airship. Now head northwest to
the Sylph Cave.

Use Luca's Necklace to open the
door. Head and then go down the
rope to the south. Now head west
and then south and examine the
door. You will be attacked by
Trap Door. This battle is pretty
easy. Just wait until Trap Door
uses target. Have Rosa use

The second door will have a
chest containing a lustrous
sword. The third door will have
three treasure chests. The
fourth door will have nothing

matter.

Now head north and examine the
door to fight a Trap Door. Grab
the crystal and leave the room.
Head south and a boss battle
will start.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Demon Wall
Weak: None

The boss battles are starting to
get really difficult. You have
to defeat this boss before he
gets close to you. Once he is
close to you, he'll start using
crush, which deals 9999 damage
to one person.

Have Cecil, Edge and Kain attack
normally, have Rydia summon
Leviathan and then have Rosa
cast berserk on Cecil, Edge and
Kain then have her use haste. If
you she has the bardsong augment
learned then you could use
hastemarch instead.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Bahamut
Weak: None

The strategy to win against
Bahamut in previous FFIV won't
work on this version. Instead of
Bahamut using mega flare on the
party, he will cast reflect on
himself and use mega flare on
himself and bounce back the
damage to your party. So casting
reflect on your party to bounce
back mega flare won't work
anymore.

First have Rosa or Fusoya cast
slow on Bahamut and then shell
on the party. Have Cecil and
Edge attack, Rydia should summon
Leviathan, and then Rosa should
cast haste on the party and
Fusoya should use bless and then
haste. Once the countdown
reaches 1, quickly have everyone
defend. Now heal everyone's HP
and continue attacking. If
you're lucky, you can defeat
Bahamut before he is able to
cast Mega Flare.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rydia can now summon Bahamut.
Now head back outside by using
teleport and then SAVE THE
GAME!! You wouldn't want to do
this all over again. Head back
to the Lunar Whale and head
south from the Crystal Palace.
You will see a cave here
surrounded by elevated land.
Land here and enter the cave.

battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Elemental Archfiends Weak:
Fire (Scarmiglione), Ice
(Cagnazzo), Lightning (Cagnazzo
surrounded by water), Holy
(Barbariccia), Ice/Water
(Rubicante, only when he is not
wearing cloak)

For this battle, you will have
to fight the four elemental
archfiends one after the other.
The first battle is with
Scarmiglione. Just use the same
strategy you used in Mount
Ordeals. First have protect and
shell cast on the party then
have Rosa or Fusoya cast curaja
and Rydia summon Ifrit. Don't
use firaga because Scarmiglione
will counter with gas, which
gives everyone in your party
random status effects. This one
is easy.

The next one is Cagnazzo. Have
Cecil and Edge attack normally,
Rydia use thundaga when water
surrounds Cagnazzo and blizzaga
when water is not surrounding
Cagnazzo. Let Rosa and Fusoya
handle healing. Cagnazzo will
counter with hold if he is
attacked physically so have Rosa
and Fusoya heal them by using
Esuna. This one is also pretty
easy.

This is where it gets a little
bit hard. The next one is
Barbariccia. This time, you
don't have Kain to stop her when
she is in her tornado form.
While in this form, she will use
maelstrom to reduce the party's
HP to critical. Have Rosa and
Fusoya heal them right away. She
will then use petrify on one of
your party so heal it with
esuna. All physical attacks
won't work on Barbariccia so you
have to use magic to beat her.
Have Rydia summon Bahamut. Only
two summon with Bahamut should
kill her. Cast haste on Rydia
and slow on Barbariccia when you
can.
********************************
Thanks to decisivebattler for
this info

Barbariccia is weak against holy
so you can have Rosa and Fusoya
cast holy for 7000 + damage or
you can let Rosa dualcast holy
and Fusoya can heal.
********************************

The last one is Rubicante. This
time, instead of countering with
fira, he will counter with
firaga. Have Rosa and Fusoya
ready to heal. When Rubicante
opens up his cloak, have Edge
use flood or frost and have
Rydia summon Leviathan. Have
Cecil attack normally or he can
help with the healing. Be
careful of inferno. Make sure to
always have everyone's HP full
so they don't die from it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now go back and save the game
and buy anything you need. There
is another boss ahead. When
you're ready, continue north for
a boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: CPU
	Attack Node
	Defense Node
Weak: Lightning
	Earth
	None

This battle is pretty difficult.
The attack node does an attack
called Laser Barrage, which
deals heavy damage to everyone
in the party. The defense node
will do nothing but heal the
CPU. The CPU will not do
anything until it is alone. He
will use an attack that will
deal 9999 damage to one person
in your party and he can also
regenerate the other nodes and
we don't want that. So our first
target needs to be the attack
node, then kill the CPU and then
the defense node.

Have Cecil and Edge attack the
attack node normally, Rydia
should summon Ramuh and have
Rosa and Fusoya ready to cast
curaja when the attack node uses
laser barrage. If laser barrage
ends up killing too many members
of your party then you can try
letting Cecil use shell first
and then attack.

Once the attack node is
defeated, focus all attacks on
the CPU. Cecil, Edge and Rydia
should continue what they were
doing. You don't have to worry
about Ramuh killing the defense
node first because the defense
node absorbs elemental damage.
Once the CPU is gone, then just
start attacking the defense node
until it dies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A scene will occur. Now you will
have control of a kid. Head
outside the house. Head
northeast and you'll find Kluya.
Talk to him for a scene. Now
head back to the house and go
into the room to the left. Talk
to Cecilia for another scene.
Fusoya, Rosa and Rydia will
leave the party and Kain will
rejoin.

Now examine the crystal to get
to the moon. Another scene will
occur. Rosa and Rydia will
rejoin the party. Now before you
get off the ship, examine the
crystal and go back to Earth.
There are still things that need
to be done there.

If you already talked to
Weddingway in Humminway's Abode
then you can now do the last
part of the Namingway sidequest.
The place where you can find him
is always random. The places
people were able to find him is
in one of the Chocobo Forests,
Underground Waterway, Mount
Hobs, Sylph Cave, or the Lair of
the Father. He will give you the
Safe Travel Augment. This isn't
a very good augment to use if
you're low leveled. It is useful
if your party needs to recover.

Baron Castle (Optional) [OPTL17]

Items: *HP +50% Augment

Go to the place where you first
met Cid. Enter the room to the
right and then go upstairs. Talk
to the soldier here to get the
HP +50% augment.

If you want to pay a visit to
your old allies, you can find
them in the Hall of Prayer in
Mysidia. Now head back to
Kokkol's Forge in the
underworld. You have to board
the Enterprise or the Falcon to
get to the underworld.

Items: *Piercing Magic Augment

Go to Whyt's house and talk to

her.

Now head back to the Lunar Whale
and examine the crystal to get
to the moon. Head to the Crystal
Palace to get to the final
dungeon.

Items: *Bless Augment,

Head west to heal your HP and
status and then head west to
heal your MP. Now head north and
you'll find a sparkling object
on the floor. Get it to get the
Bless Augment. If you gave
Fusoya 1 - 2 augments, you will
also find two other sparkling
objects. Get them to get the
Omnicasting Augment and Phoenix
Augment. Now head north to the
next room.

Now go to the center of the
room. You will be teleported to
the final dungeon.

This is it, the final dungeon.
Head up the stairs to the north
and then head east. Hug the east
wall and you should find a
hidden path. Follow it north and
then west. Continue south to
find a chest containing a black
garb. An enemy will ambush you
when you open it. Now go back to
the entrance. Now head west to
find another hidden path. Go
into the portal and then head
south to the next area.

Head north to find a chest
containing sage's staff. An
enemy will ambush you when you
open it. Now head west and then
south to find a teleporter. Go
into the teleporter and then
head west. Now head south and
then west to the next area.

Now cast float on the party and
head north. Remove Cecil's
Excalibur and replace it when
his second strongest weapon.
Your next enemy can absorb
elemental attacks. Examine the
sword on the pedestal for a boss
battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: White Dragon
Weak: None

This battle isn't very tough. If
Rosa has the omnicast augment
then have her use blink on
everyone in the party and then
have her cast slow on the
dragon. Have Edge attack
normally and Cecil use protect
just incase and attack normally.
Rydia should summon Bahamut and
have Kain jump or attack
normally. The White Dragon's
physical attack is very strong
so have Rosa ready to heal your
party just in case they get hit.

The reason I had you cast float
on the party is because the
White Dragon counters summon
with quake. Your party won't be
affected by it as long as they
have float on.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will get the Murasame for
winning the battle. Now head
back to the entrance. Feel free
to go back to the Crystal Palace
to heal and save. Once you're
ready, head south to the next
area.

Now head south and then east to
find a hidden path. Now head
north and then hug the west
wall. Now head south, west and
then north to find a chest
containing a flame whip. Now
head back and then continue all
the way north and then all the
way west to find a chest
containing a dragon shield. Head
south to the next area.

Now head south. Ignore the
stairs and just continue south.
Now head east to find a hidden
path. Follow it to find a chest
containing a dragon helm.
Continue east to find another
hidden path. Follow the path to
find two treasure chests. Now go
back and head down the stairs we
saw earlier.

Head all the way to the east to
find a chest containing artemis
arrows. Now go back a little and
then head south. Head west and
enter the room there for an
elixir. Now head back outside
and head east. Now head south
and then west to get to the next
area.

Grab the two chests you see on
your touch screen and then head
to the exit to the left. Now
grab the chest and a Behemoth
will attack you. Refer to the
Lair of the Father [OPTL15]
section of this walkthrough to
find a strategy to defeat him.
Now head east to get to the next
area.

Now head south and then west.
Ignore the door for now and
continue west to find a treasure
chest. An enemy will attack you
when you open it. I must warn
you that the enemies guarding
this chest are strong so be
careful. Slow and stop can help
you out on this battle. Now go
back to the door we passed
earlier and enter it.

Head all the way north and then
head east to find a chest
containing a protect ring.
Continue east to find another
hidden path. Now head all the
way south to the next area. Head
east to find a chest containing
a crystal mail. Another Behemoth
will attack you for opening the
chest. Now go back to the
previous room and head north to
get to the next area.

Head east to find a chest. Now
before you open it, I want to
let you know that the enemy
guarding this chest is very very
strong. If you don't want to get
this right now, you can just
come back for this later. To
defeat the enemy, have Rosa cast
berserk on him so he can't use
Thermal Ray. Now have Rosa cast
blink on the party and heal when
necessary. Using slow also
helps. Now head west to get to
the next area.

Grab the chest you see on the
touch screen and then go to the
next area. Head west and you'll
find a treasure chest. An enemy
will ambush you when you open
it. Now head east and then north
to the next area. Grab the chest
here and go back. This time go
down the stairs to the south to
the next area.

Head west and you'll find a
chest containing a fuma
shuriken. Now head east to find
another fuma shuriken. Now go
down the stairs to the south and
then head down the path to the
left for a chest containing a
cottage. Make sure to remember
this area because we're coming
back here later. Now head west
from the treasure chest and
you'll find an invisible bridge.
Head west, north and then east
to a hidden path. Follow it to
the next area.

Grab the chest here containing a
golden apple. Now head east and
go into the portal. Now head
north to find another portal.
Head north to find another chest
protected by a Behemoth. Now
continue north to find another
portal. Here you will find a
SAVE POINT! Save the game and
heal up. Phew. Now we can relax
a little. If you want to go back
to that chest we passed earlier,
now is a good time to get it.
Now head south to the next area.
Head east and you'll find a
sword. Examine it for a boss
battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Dark Bahamut
Weak: None

This battle is pretty hard. Dark
Bahamut will use Mega Flare at
the very beginning of the
battle. If you're level is high
enough, everyone should be able
to survive it. My party was at
level 70 - 73 when I fought Dark
Bahamut. You could probably
handle it at a lower level like
around 65?

Quickly have Rosa heal everyone
with curaga or curaja. Then let
her cast blink and then haste on
the party. Make sure to heal
when the party needs it. Cecil
should cast shell and then
attack normally once he has
blink on. Edge should attack
when he has blink on and Kain
should jump once he has blink
on. DO NOT use Rydia's summon
because Dark Bahamut will
counter with Mega Flare and do
not use magic because Dark
Bahamut might use reflect. If
Rydia has the piercing magic
augment however, you can let her
use Flare or you can use the
Stardust Rod as am item to
attack.

Dark Bahamut will counter magic
with flare so make sure Rydia
has shell on before using any
magic and Dark Bahamut will
counter physical attacks with
attack so make sure Cecil and
Edge have blink on before
attacking. Have Rosa cast slow
and haste when she can.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will get Ragnarok for
winning the battle. Now head
back to where you found the
treasure chest with the cottage
inside. Head south to get to the
next area.

Grab the chest on the touch
screen and an enemy will attack
you. Now go back south and then
north to the next area. Head
south and then east. Go up the
first stairs you find to get to
a save point. Save the game and
heal up then get the chest at
the back of the room. Now leave
this room and head east. Go to
the next room you find and head
north. Examine the lance for a
boss battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Plague Horror
Weak: None

This battle is pretty easy.
Plague will start by casting
doom on the party and then use
haste on your party to speed up
the countdown.

Don't bother wasting your time
with supportive spells just have
everyone attack. Cecil and Edge
should attack normally, Kain
should jump, Rosa cast holy and
Rydia summon Bahamut. Plague
should die before any of your
party dies from doom.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will get the holy lance for
winning. Now go back to the save
point and save the game.
Continue east and you'll find
another door. A boss battle will
occur when you approach the
treasure chests.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Lunasaur
Weak: Fire, Holy

This battle is also pretty easy.
Have Rosa attack first unless
she has the piercing magic
augment learned. Rosa should
cast slow on Lunasaur and then
have her heal and cast haste on
the party when it is safe. Have
Cecil and Edge attack normally,
Kain jump and Rydia summon
Bahamut. Bahamut should be able
to deal 9999 damage on Lunasaur.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grab the two chests for a
ribbon. Ribbon is considered to
be one of the best equip in
Final Fantasy. It prevents all
status ailments. Now head back
and save the game. Go back and
continue east and then north.
Now head west and then down the
stairs to the south to get to
the next area.

We're getting close to Zemus
now. All the battles here will
use the boss battle music but
you can run away from them if
things get too difficult. Now
head east and then go down the
stairs to the south. Now head
all the way west to find a
chest. Continue south and then
head east. Head south when you
can and you'll find a sword on a
pedestal. This will be the last
boss you'll encounter in this
dungeon other than the final
boss. Get everyone's HP up and
examine the sword.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Ogopogo
Weak: None

Another easy boss fight. Ogopogo
will start the battle by using
deluge. It should only deal
about 1500 damage to your party
so they should survive. Have
Rosa heal everyone with curaga
and then have Cecil cast shell.
Then have Rosa cast slow on
Ogopogo and then haste on the
party when she can. Have Cecil
and Edge attack normally, Kain
jump and Rydia should summon
Bahamut.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will receive the masamune
for winning. You can go back and
save if you want. When you're
ready, go to the next area. Head
south down the stairs and then
head east. You'll find a chest
containing elixir. Now head
south down the stairs and then
head west. Follow the path south
to the next area.

Head west and then south down
the stairs. Now head east and
get the chest to the south. Head
west, south and then west again
to find another treasure chest.
Now head all the way east to the
next area.

We're really close now. After
this area, it will be the final
battle. Head all the way west
and then head south. Now head
all the way east and then south.
Now head west and go to the next
area for the final battle. If
you've completed the entire map
in the game, you should get the
Treasure Hunter Augment here.
Don't worry about healing before
entering; you'll get healed
before the battle starts.

Head north and watch the scene.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Zeromus
Weak: None
My Party: Cecil Lv. 79
	    Edge  Lv. 78
	    Kain  Lv. 77
	    Rosa  Lv. 79
	    Rydia Lv. 79

Use the crystal that Golbez gave
you to start the battle.

At the beginning of the battle,
have Edge use steal. You're
going to need the dark matter
for the optional boss in new
game+ and the only way to get it
is by stealing it from Zeromus.
Have Cecil attack and Kain jump.
Once Zeromus uses black hole,
have Rosa cast slow or have
anyone use a spider silk to slow
him down. Keep doing that every
time Zeromus uses black hole.
When Zeromus starts shaking,
that means he is about to use
Big Bang. Have everyone defend
and then Press Y and open up
Rosa's battle menu and get ready
to heal. Quickly heal everyone
with Rosa after Zeromus uses Big
Bang. Don't let Rydia use any
summon or magic because
Zeromus's counter will just make
things harder for you. Just let
her support with items. Cecil,
Kain and Edge can kill Zermous
by themselves.

When Zeromus is about to die, he
will start to use meteor. Have
Rosa start casting curaja and
then have everyone who survives
use a phoenix down on your KO'd
party. Now continue attacking
and Zermous should go down in no
time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Congratulations! You've beaten
the game. Now enjoy the final
scene.

IV. New Game+ Optional Bosses
[OPTLBS]

When you get to the moon, go to
the center of the map and then
head north. You should be able
to find a stone head. Land near
it and examine it. Use the Dark
Matter for a boss battle.

Boss: Proto-Babil
Weak: None
My Party: Cecil Lv. 99
	    Edge  Lv. 99
	    Kain  Lv. 99
	    Rosa  Lv. 99
	    Rydia Lv. 99

I haven't successfully defeated
Proto-Babil with this strategy
but you can still give it a try
if you want. I'm pretty sure I
only need Adamant Armor for
everyone to defeat him but you
can still email me a better
strategy to beat Proto-Babil.

------------------
My Augments
------------------
Cecil's Augments: Attack, Bless,
Twincast, Items, Limit Break
Edge's Augments: Attack, Focus,
Steal, Items, Adrenaline Kain's
Augments: Jump, Cry, Items, HP
+50%, Phoenix Rosa's Augments:
White Magic, Dualcast, Twincast,
Items, Omnicasting Rydia's
Augments: Black Magic, Summon,
Items, Level Lust, Fast Talker

------------------
My Equipment
------------------
Cecil's Equipment: Ragnarok,
Crystal Shield, Helm, and Mail,
Protect Ring Edge's Equipment:
Murasame, Masamune, Genji Helm,
Black Garb, Genji Gloves Kain's
Equipment: Holy Lance, Dragon
Shield, and Helm, Adamant Armor,
   Protect Ring
Rosa's Equipment: Yoichi Bow,
Artemis Arrows, Ribbon, White
Robe, Rune Armlet Rydia's
Equipment: Stardust Rod, Ribbon,
Luminous Robe, Rune Armlet

Start by having Rosa cast slow
on Proto-Babil. Now have Cecil
and Rosa cast twincast, Kain
should jump, Edge use focus 2 -
3 times and then attack, and
Rydia summon Bahamut. Cecil and
Rosa should be able to deal
about 30,000 - 40,000 damage
with Ultima because of Limit
Break. Rydia, Kain and Edge
should be able to deal 9999
damage on Proto-Babil.

Once everyone dies, Kain's
Phoenix augment should activate.
Quickly revive Kain with a
Phoenix Down and then use ether
or elixir to restore his MP or
you can have Cecil (or whoever
have Bless equipped) use Bless
to regenerate Kain's MP.

********************************
Thanks to Cecil for this info

Proto-Babil was beastly and
damned-near impossible.
Thankfully, I was able to clear
him with this:

MUST HAVE: Rosa - Omnicast Edge
- Limit Break, Throw, Focus Kain
- Phoenix Anyone else - Bless
and Salve spread out Knife (AKA
Spoon Knife from earlier
translations of FFIV, can only
be picked up on the Yang
sidequest Drop some of the coin
you no doubt racked up on a ton
of elixirs

Beginning of the battle - Rosa
Omnicast Blink (obvious),
Character with Bless cast bless,
everyone else Focus as best you
can, and Melee. Rosa Cast Slow
(Not so obvious) - Slow REALLY
helps

(really not so obvious) - Have
at least one person in your
party with the Salve Ability,
and be ready to salve-->Elixir
at any moment

If you're not carefully counting
down Proto-Babil's HP, you will
get rocked when he reaches
30,000 HP. You'll know when it
happens, he begins chaining
Divine Judgement (1-shot kill in
most cases), followed by healing
himself by anywhere from
25,000-40,000 hp. Assuming your
last hit brought him from 30,001
HP to whatever it was, then he
healed by a certain amount, you
should revive your party as best
you can (Kain should come
through with Phoenix), begin
beating him back down until you
think your next hit will bring
him under 30,000 again. From
this point, everyone should be
defending, bracing, or healing,
except Edge. Edge - FOCUS,
FOCUS, Throw Knife

With any luck, the knife should
do at least 60,000 damage to
Proto-Babil, finishing him off
in one fell swoop. If this move
doesn't kill him, you might as
well restart your game, because
he's going to slaughter you
without the 999atk power of the
Knife.
********************************
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find the second optional
boss in the Giant of Babil where
you fought the Elemental
Archfiends. If you missed it,
you can still challenge him in
Mount Ordeals, where Cecil
turned into a Paladin.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boss: Geryon
Weak: None
My Party: Cecil Lv. 99
	    Edge  Lv. 99
	    Kain  Lv. 99
	    Rosa  Lv. 99
	    Rydia Lv. 99

********************************
Thanks to Cecil for this info

Equip each person in your party
with a piece of equipment that
halves primary elemental damage
(Crystal equipment, Dragon
Equipment, and Ribbons) -
Treasure Hunter Augment is
essential to picking up a third
ribbon for Edge, from Dark Sages
in Lair of the Father. Equip
each person in your party with a
Cursed Ring (MANY monsters drop
these, especially with Treasure
Hunter Augment) Make sure Rosa
has Omnicast Augment

Beginning of the Battle - Rosa
Omnicast Blink across the party
Chain attack to slowly drain
Geryon's HPs

V. Namingway Sidequest [NMNG]
================================

At the very beginning of the
game, you will find a rabbit
with a red hood in Baron Castle
on the way to Cecil's room. Talk
to him and he'll introduce
himself as Namingway. He will
ask you if you want to change
your name. You can choose
anything; you won't be able to
change your name.

Next you will find him in the
Mist Cave. A scene will occur
right when you enter. He will
then change his name from
Namingway to Mappingway. You
will receive the Wayfarer's Map
from him.

The next town you'll find him is
Kaipo. You'll find him at the
northeastern most house. He will
change his name to Livingway.
He'll let you view the bestiary.

The next place you will find him
is in Fabul Castle's Inn. He'll
let you view events that you've
seen in the game. He will change
his name to Recordingway. You
can now view the bestiary by
talking to the Fat Chocobo.

Now head to the chocobo forest
south of Mount Ordeals. You will
find Recordingway here. He will
change his name to Campingway.
He will ask you if he can have
one of your tent. Answer yes and
he will take all of them instead
and he'll give you 300 gil. You
can now view the event theatre
by talking to the Fat Chocobo.

The next place you will find him
is in Baron's weapon/armor shop.
Talk to him and he will change
his name to Jammingway. He'll
let you listen to the game's
music.

The next place he'll go to is
Troia. Head east from the pub to
find him. Talk to him and he'll
ask you to distract the girl
that works in the pub. He will
change his name to Cheatingway.
Go to the pub and talk to the
girl in the counter. You can now
listen to the music box by
talking to the Fat Chocobo.

The next place you'll find him
is Agart. He'll now change his
name to Puddingway. He will ask
you to bring him a rainbow
pudding. The rainbow pudding is
a rare drop that can be dropped
by flan type monsters. The flan
that has the highest chance of
dropping it is the Flan Princess
but they are very difficult and
take too long to defeat and you
can only find them in the final
dungeon. A lot of people prefer
hunting the Yellow Jelly in the
Antlion's Den instead since
they're easier and faster to
kill. Give him the rainbow
pudding once you have it and he
will disappear. There is a
phoenix down inside the house he
was standing in.

Now you will find him in the
Dwarven Castle. You must first
defeat Calcabrina before you can
meet him. From the throne room,
head south and then east. Now
enter the room between the
weapon and armor shop. You will
find Puddingway at the top right
of this room. He will change his
name to Mopingway. Talk to him
again and you'll end up in a
battle with him. He will give
you the Eye Gouge Augment for
winning.

The next place you want to go to
is the Feymarch. From Whyt's
house, head west and then go
down the stairs to find him.
He'll change his name to
Lovingway. He will then ask you
the name of the person you're
going out with. This name will
be used for the ???'s Love
Augment.

The next place you'll find him
is in Mysidia. After the Lunar
Whale scene, go back to Mysidia
and go to the Hall of Prayer.
You will find Lovingway there.
He'll change his name to
Weddingway and he'll give you
the ???'s Love Augment.

Next place you'll find him is
the Hummingway Abode. Talk to
him and then you're done...

The last place you'll find him
is random. He can be found in
one of these places. He'll be in
one of the chocobo forests,
Underground Waterway, Mount
Hobs, Sylph Cave, or the Lair of
the Father. Once you find him,
talk to him and he'll change his
name to Going-my-way. He will
then give you the Safe Travel
Augment.
