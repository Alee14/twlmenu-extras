Introduction
================================

Apollo Justice is the first game
in the so-called "Apollo Series"
of the Ace Attorney series,
otherwise known as the "Gyakuten
Saiban" series in Japan (this
game is known as Gyakuten Saiban
4 in Japan). It is an adventure
game chronicaling the life and
times of rookie defense attorney
Apollo Justice as he tries to
prove his clients' innocence in
a world where no one else
believes them.

Unlike the Phoenix Trilogy, when
this game was first released in
Japan, there was no
corresponding English
translation. That was remedied
on Feb. 19th, 2008, when Apollo
Justice hit American shores.

I urge you to grab up any
legitimate copy of the game so
that Capcom can release the
second Apollo Justice game
(currently in development in
Japan) in the US.

The game can also be played
using the stylus.

================================
Getting Started
================================

The touch screen is where all
the decisions are laid out.
Going to the next statement in a
witness' testimony, heading to
another location during
investigation, it's all there!

The top screen is where you'll
see the events unfold. You'll
see arguments between the
defense and the prosecution
here, as well as finding out
more pieces of information from
dialouge.

The Court Record is where you'll
store that information.
Everything in the case is there,
including involved people. To
switch from viewing evidence to
viewing profiles and vice-versa,
press the R button, or use the
stylus on the top right corner
of the touch screen.

During Investigation phases,
you'll get your chance to
explore and prepare for court.
You can also talk to other
people, whether they be the
defendant of a witness for the
prosecution.

Returning from the last game,
and only during case 4, are
Psyche-Locks. Basically, when
someone has a secret to hide,
you'll see it in the form of
locks. The stronger the secret
is, the more locks that will
appear (if you're wondering, the
maximum is 5 locks total).
Pressing the X Button or
touching the Magatama icon will
begin a process where you'll
present pieces of evidence to
counter the person's story and,
in the process, unlock their
secrets.

The courtroom is where most of
the action takes place. Here,
you'll cross-examine a witness'
testimony to find faults in
them. In doing do, you'll help
clear your client's name.
However, like in the last 2
games, you have a health bar.
When the bar is empty, the Judge
will pronounce your client
guilty and you'll have to start
from you last saved point. This
time, the health bar will re-set
itself during intermissions.
Making its debut in this game is
the Percieve System. Basically,
it's an in-court version of the
Psyche-Locks. Using the bottom
screen, you can zoom in on a
witness and examine their body
language. When you find
something strange, you can shout
"Gotcha!" to point out that
nervous habit and present
evidence to prove that they're
lying.

================================
Characters
================================

Apollo Justice: A young man
burning with passion, Apollo is
the new main-stay attorney in
the series. He has the power to
examine a witness' body language
with full clarity, though he
doesn't fully understand it.

Phoenix Wright: Only playable in
one flashback case, Phoenix,
seven years later, is no longer
an attorney due to a certain
case. He's a bit of an odd bird
now, but he still retains his
sharp wit.

Kristoph Gavin: Kristoph is
Apollo's mentor and boss at the
Gavin Law Offices. He's a bit
intimidating, and is considered
a genius at what he does. He
moves in mysterious ways, which
could be used against him...

Klavier Gavin: Kristoph's
younger brother, lead vocalist
of the hit band the Gavinners,
and Apollo's prosecuting rival.
He's actually quite a nice guy
once you get to know him.

Trucy Wright: Apollo's assistant
and magician-in-training. She's
also Phoenix's daughter, which
shocks some when they first hear
about it. She also runs the
Wright Anything Agency, which
handles both talent and law. Oh,
did I forget to mention that she
has the same power Apollo has?

Ema Skye: A detective for the
police department. She's
returned from Europe after
studying forensic sciences, and,
much to her displeasure, is
forced to work with Klavier, or
as she calls him, the
"glimmerous fop", often. She's
also much more aloof than she
used to be.

Winston Payne: AKA the "Rookie
Killer." He's got a superior
attitude, but that fades when he
faces off against a skilled
attorney. He's been waiting
seven years to give Phoenix a
nice send-off...

================================
DA WALKTHROUGH!!!
================================

Case 1: Turnabout Trump
[TURNTRUMP]
--------------------------------

:DAY 1 " TRIAL, PART 1:

Apollo's in the waiting lobby, a
nervous wreck. He's feeling the
pressure as his mentor, Kristoph
Gavin meets him. Kristoph
supposes that its only natural
that Apollo's nervous; not only
is it his first trial, it's also
a murder case. Justice certainly
swings for the big fences.
Kristoph suggests that Apollo
meets with the client, who looks
an awful lot like Phoenix.
Apollo feels the pressure piling
on when the Phoenix look-alike
tells him that he's counting on
the defense attorney to pull out
the truth. Apollo has no time to
poke further as court begins.

Well, the Judge is the same, but
Payne, unbelievably, has grown
more hair out the back of his
head! It looks like Ace Attorney
Kristoph was supposed to be the
attorney in charge of the case,
but the defendant decided to
switch to Apollo at the last
moment. The judge calls the
defendant, that Phoenix look-
alike, into the courtroom.
Wonder why he looks like
Phoenix? Well, that's because he
IS Phoenix! Phoenix Wright is
back in court under the worst
circumstances.

Payne outlines the case: Phoenix
Wright, now a pianist (don't be
fooled; he stinks at playing),
murdered a traveler by the name
of Shadi Smith with a bottle of
grape juice. The bottle itself
will be added to the court
record. It was the victim's
first time at the Borscht Bowl
Club, the restaurant that
employs the defendant. Payne
also points out that though
Phoenix is employed as a
pianist, his real talent lays in
poker, and that the crime took
place during a game. Since poker
is a gambling game, that already
makes Phoenix a criminal!
Kristoph objects, saying that it
was merely a competition, which
means that there was no real
gambling going on. "Only the
cards, their backs wreathed in
blue flame, know its final
outcome," he says. Payne
clarifies that the cards on the
table had blue backs. The judge
then requests that Phoenix
testify about the game.

PHOENIX WRIGHT'S FIRST
TESTIMONY: THE COMPETITION
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I am a pianist by trade... yet 

-My real job is to take on inter

-The room where we play and the 
attractions.

-The rules are simple: we play a

-That's all it is... a game. And

Kristoph will ask Apollo if he
wants a refresher on cross-
examination. No matter which
option you choose, you'll have
to cross-examine Phoenix.

Start by pressing the first
statement, the one about Phoenix
not being able to play the
piano. Phoenix does play when
the customers want him to. He
only plays one song, and that
usually satifies them. However,
it's just a facade, a cover for
his true occupation. Press the
next statement, the one about
playing poker. Phoenix claims
that he's a pro, and takes a
little jab at Payne in the
process. During those seven
years in the Borcht Bowl Club,
he's never lost a game of poker,
not even once. That's why they
come: to beat the undefeated
poker champ. Now press the next
statement, the one about the
attractions. The poker room used
to be used by criminals back in
the day. Those days are gone,
though. Of particular mention is
the window; it was most likely
used for keeping a lookout, not
much else, though. There are
also a couple of tricks to that
room, but the regulars know
about them. Press the next
statement, the one about the
rules. To prevent cheating, the
club uses red and blue decks.
Those decks are alternated to
keep people from slipping in
cards. Poker is played by making
five-card hands, and the one
that gets the better hand wins.

The judge momentairly stops the
questioning. He points out that
people aren't normally killed
over a game of cards. He asks
Phoenix about the crime, but
he'll say that he expected an
objection from the defense; he
was talking about the game, not
the murder. Kristoph will ask
Phoenix about his relation to
the crime, and he'll amend his
testimony:

-I plead silence regarding the m
touched the murder weapon.

Take a look at the bottle: it
says in the description that it
has Phoenix's fingerprints on
it. Kinda hard to say that he
didn't touch it. Present the
bottle against this revised
statement. After Payne's
explanation, Apollo objects:
Phoenix is an employee at the
restaurant, so it's not odd at
all that his fingerprints are on
the weapon. Payne steps in
again, saying that the
fingerprints are upside down. He
was holding the bottle inverted,
as if he were to hit someone
with it! Phoenix continues to
plead silence, and that's when
Kristoph steps in, pointing out
the fact that Phoenix called the
police that night on his cell
phone. If Phoenix were the real
murderer, why would he call the
police? Plus, he had to go
upstairs to call them. Why leave
the scene as is? Kristoph
surmises that Payne has a
witness, and he confirms,
calling them to the stand.

Why is the witness cowering? She
seems to be a bit nervous. It
takes a little coaxing to get
her out into the open. Once she
does, she snaps a photo of the
judge. Her name is Olga Orly.
Not only is she a waitress, she
also provides other services,
such as taking photos. She even
has one of Phoenix and the
victim talking on that night!
That photo will be added to the
court record. Only three people
were in the Hydeout, the scene
of the murder, at the time:
Phoenix Wright, Shadi Smith,
and, of course, the witness, Ms.
Orly. If Phoenix didn't do it,
then that makes her the prime
suspect! She'll begin her
testimony of the events that
transpired that night.

OLGA ORLY'S FIRST TESTIMONY:
THAT FATEFUL NIGHT
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night, customer asked me t

-It was cold... Both players pla

-The victim, he plays whole time

-Then, last hand is done! But so

-That man flew at victim, and is

Apollo objects to Phoenix
losing, but Payne has a photo of
the outcome of the final hand.
The victim had more chips than
Phoenix did, which means that he
WAS losing! The Chip Photo will
be added to the court record.

Take a look at the autopsy
report: it says that the victim
died from blunt-force trauma to
the head. There is no way he
died from suffocation! Present
the autopsy report against
Orly's last statement, the one
about the victim being strangled
to death. Payne confirms the
info with a photo: it's of the
victim with his hat off (he's
suprisingly bald...). That photo
will be added to the court
record. However, the report's
not decisive enough to warrant a
new testimony. Ms. Orly will now
revise her testimony:

-After defendant tried to strang

This time, look at the photo
Payne just handed out: the
victim is not wearing a locket!
Present Crime Photo 2 against
her third statement, the one
about the locket. Where did the
locket go? Kristoph has a pretty
good idea: maybe Phoenix took
it! The judge calls Phoenix up
to the stand and notices that
Phoenix is wearing a locket.
Phoenix confirms that it's a
locket, and inside is a picture
of his daughter. The court is
shocked, but Payne confirms: the
picture in the locket is indeed
Phoenix's daughter. Both men had
lockets, but this can't be a
mere coincidence. The judge asks
Olga to testify about the
outcome of the game.

OLGA ORLY'S SECOND TESTIMONY:
SERIOUS COMPETITION
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-The game began with 3,500 point

-House chips come in two size: s

-The one who was winning... dah,

-For last hand, defendant play w

-The moment loss was decided, de

Press her second statement, the
one about the two sizes. All of
the chips that were used are in
the photo. She suddenly gets a
bit nervous. "Press harder".
Payne objects to an explanation
about the chips, but Apollo asks
her how much each type of chip
was worth. Some were worth 100
points and others were worth
1,000 points. Kristoph senses
something that's a bit off, so
"Add to testimony":

-One kind of chip is worth 100 p
kinds in all.

Look at the Chip Photo. Each man
started with 3,500 points.
Adding them up would net you
7,000 points. If the big chips
were worth 1,000, then the
totals don't add up; instead,
the total would be 10,600
points! Let's try this from a
different angle: what if the
smaller chips were 1,000? If so,
then the total comes out to
7,000 points! And if the smaller
chips are 1,000 points, then
Phoenix was winning: after all,
he'd have 4,100 points and the
victim would be left with 2,900
points! Present the Chip Photo
against her third statement, the
one about the victim winning,
and, when prompted about the
chip and point count, say that
"both were right". Phoenix now
has no motive for murder! That,
unfortunately, is when Olga
interrupts with a new motive:
during the last hand, Phoenix
cheated! The judge asks Olga to
testify about the cheating.

OLGA ORLY'S THIRD TESTIMONY: THE
FINAL HAND
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-The last hand... both men had "

-There is four of each card in d

-If you look at both men's hands

-The next moment, game becomes a
exposed!

-He took bottle in his hand... P

If you don't know what a full
house is, here's an explanation:
a full house is a hand that
holds one pair and one three-of-
a-kind, and that's not easy to
get. Both men did indeed have
full houses, which means that
there was indeed cheating going
on at the time. But if Phoenix
did cheat, then he lost that
hand. Why would a con-man lose
if he cheated?

Press Olga's third statement,
the one about the cheating being
obvious. Olga says that Phoenix
played a fifth ace! She also
remembers the hands: the victim
played three aces while Phoenix
played two. That's more than
enough evidence to prove that
there was cheating. Kristoph
will ask Olga to amend her
testimony:

-Mr. Smith's hand has three aces
aces in all.

Look at the Chip Photo,
specifically at the victim's
hand. His hand holds two aces,
not three! Present the Chip
Photo against this statement and
point to the victim's hand when
prompted. Where'd the fifth ace
go to? Olga insists that there
was a fifth ace. Why would she
continue to insist on this fact
if it was a lie? She must be
telling the truth. Kristoph
proposes that they look at the
cards that were played that
night. Which of the hands is
more suspicious? Well, according
to Olga's testimony, Mr. Smith
had three aces but only two are
depicted in the photo. Select
"View victim's hand". Now, if
you've played Case 1-5, you
should know what to do here. If
not, here's a quick overview:
use the stylus to rotate or zoom
in on the evidence. Turn the
cards around so that their backs
are showing. See anything odd?
That's right, one of the cards
has a blue backing, but the
others do not! Examine that
card. This proves that the cards
were switched! Olga slips,
mumbling that she put that card
in Phoenix's hand. Kristoph
notices and suggests that she
was the cheater! She's probably
a con artist! Apollo decides to
act on that tidbit and accuses
Olga of murder!

The judge is about to adjourn
the court, when Phoenix objects!
He's not going to let the court
be adjourned yet! He says that
the last game was played with
the red cards, which means that
the blue card was swapped in. He
asks Apollo to consider when
that card was swapped. Think
about it: if you had swapped a
card in and tried to pull it,
you'd be in big trouble. It must
have been "after the murder".
But why swap that card after the
murder? Now the question becomes
"Who swapped the cards?" It
couldn't have been Phoenix or
Olga; they would have used a red
card, not a blue card. So it
must be "someone else", someone
not yet mentioned. A FOURTH
person. This person made two
mistakes: one was the fact that
they used a blue card. The other
was that they swapped an ace for
a king. He claims that there was
another person at the restaurant
that night. The judge decides to
ajourn the court for a little
recess.

In the lobby, Kristoph asks
Phoenix to leave the defending
to his attorney. Phoenix shows
Apollo his locket and the
picture inside. Awww, isn't she
cute? He goes on to say that
trial law is like poker: it's
all about reading your opponent
to see when they're bluffing or
lying. Phoenix says that Apollo
has this ability to see these
tells. For example, Olga rubbed
her neck during a certain part
of her testimony. Apollo didn't
notice that at all. Last but not
least, Phoenix admits that he
still hasn't told the whole
truth as to the events of that
night. He's counting on Apollo
to drag the truth out into the
light of day. Time to head back
into court. Save your game.

:DAY 1 " TRIAL, PART 2:

Back in court, Kristoph requests
that Olga retakes the stand. In
a flash, she drops the Russian
accent, takes off the warm
clothing, and reveals her true
self as Olga "Quick-Fingers"
Orly, a professional card
dealer. Before the murder, she
was hired by the victim to help
destroy Phoenix's reputation and
winning streak by having him
cheat. Phoenix, however, managed
to sneak out of their trap. She
still claims that Phoenix hit
Smith with a bottle. The judge
requests that Olga testify about
the plan.

OLGA "QUICK-FINGERS" ORLY'S
FINAL TESTIMONY: THE BEST LAID
TRAPS
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night, I planted the card 

-And Wright lost the last hand, 
searched him!

-But the planted card was gone! 

-The next moment, Wright picked 

-It wasn't me who hit Smith! It 

Look at Olga's posture during
her fourth statement. She's
rubbing her neck again. Press
this statement. Suddenly, Apollo
gets a strange feeling. "Press
harder". When she claims that
Phoenix used the bottle,
Apollo's sight automatically
zooms in on Olga's neck. Press
the "Percieve" button and Apollo
will yell "Gotcha!" Apollo will
point out her habit and when
asked to point out what reminds
her of the murder, present the
Deadly Bottle. If she's rubbing
her neck, then maybe SHE was the
one hit by the bottle, not the
victim! She's not ready to give
up just yet, as she'll revise
the last statement of her
testimony:

-He's the one who did it! I didn
cops got there!

Remember the fact that it was
Phoenix that called the police.
Didn't he go back upstairs to
use his cell phone to do so?
Present Wright's Cell Phone
against this statement. Olga
breaks down and confesses. She
was hit with the bottle by none
other than the victim, and was
unconcious for some time. When
she came to, he was already
dead. That's why she lied: if
she HAD testified truthfully,
then she'd be a suspect.
Kristoph calls her a liar, and
points out that she has a
motive: she had her reputation
at stake, and if word got out
that she failed, she'd be
ruined, thus why she killed the
victim. That's when Phoenix
takes the stand, chuckling.
There's still a possibility of a
fourth person, and asks Apollo
to name them, reminding him of
the blunder: they weren't
considering the color on the
back the cards. Think back to
the beginning of the trial:
Kristoph mentioned the blue
backs. Maybe HE was the fourth
person in that room! Present
Kristoph's profile when
prompted. Remember, Kristoph's
comment came before the Chip
Photo was shown. Phoenix
concurrs. Payne objects, saying
that Kristoph had never met the
victim. Phoenix counters by
saying that maybe they did meet,
and on the night of the crime,
no less.

Apollo asks that Phoenix testify
to the court, and Kristoph, of
all people, objects. He says
that anything happening before
the game is irrelevant. The
judge, however, says that Apollo
is the one to make that
decision, since he is the
attorney in charge. Choose to
"hear the testimony". Kristoph
calls Apollo a traitor as
Phoenix testifies.

PHOENIX WRIGHT'S FINAL
TESTIMONY: APPETITE BEFORE
MURDER
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That evening, Kristoph and I ha

Kristoph is in shock, realizing
that the call was a lure, and he
fell for it, hook, line, and
sinker. He orders Apollo to
break Phoenix's testimony.
What's wrong with him!?

Press the third statement, the
one about the "trap". Luckily
for him, Phoenix put his hands
in his pockets and found the
bait card: the 5 of Hearts. He
snuck the card away in his grape
juice bottle. The judge asks
Phoenix to amend his testimony
accordingly:

-I discovered the "trap" during 
the bottle.

Examine the Deadly Bottle and
use the dials to rotate it so
that the label is in the back.
Place the cursor near the bottom
of the bottle and press
"examine". There's no card in
there! Present the bottle
against this statement (you MUST
examine the bottle before you
can present it). This puzzles
Phoenix, as he's sure that he
placed a card in there. Back to
the cross-examination. Present
Crime Photo 1 against his fifth
statement, the one about the
bleeding head. If this was the
scene Phoenix witnessed, then
how could he have seen the
victim's head? Phoenix admits
that he put the hat back on the
head after the murder had taken
place. Phoenix had a reason for
putting that hat back on, and it
has to do with the call he made
to Kristoph. He recorded it, and
plays it back for the court.
When Kristoph mentions the
victim's "bone china pate",
Apollo catches on and asks his
mentor why he knew the victim
was bald if he never met him
before. The judge admits that
there's no other option left but
to call Kristoph to the stand,
and adjourns the court for
another recess.

Back in the lobby, Apollo is met
by a strange girl and is asked
to pick a card, any card. Apollo
chooses one, and finds that it's
the Ace of Spades; probably the
the fifth ace that was played
that night. On it is a single
drop of blood. The girl asks
Apollo to help her father out.
Wait. Is this girl Phoenix's
daughter? The Bloody Ace will be
added to the court record.

Well, looks like the tables have
turned: Kristoph is on the stand
and Phoenix is behind the
defense's desk. Kristoph
chuckles and admits that he
hasn't been telling the truth,
and will now testify.

KRISTOPH GAVIN'S TESTIMONY: THAT

Press his fifth statement, the
one about the three people.
Kristoph never saw this fourth
person. In fact, the only
evidence that someone else was
there is the swapped card. Why
would they swap the card? It's a
lot more trouble than it's
worth. Choose to "show evidence"
and present the Bloody Ace; the
killer knew that if they left it
behind, then they'd be in
trouble, since it showed what
really happened. Kristoph
objects to the ace, claiming
that it's forged evidence.
Phoenix, however, says that the
only person capable of proving
that it was forged was the
killer, and that closes his trap
for a bit. However, he says that
it's only conjecture, but
Phoenix objects, claiming that
logic can prove it all.

Phoenix will pull out the floor
plans and asks Apollo what
doesn't fit with the ace. Point
to the victim's marker; if his
head was tilted back, then the
blood would have hit the floor,
not the card. Phoenix explains
that the chairs swivel, so he'll
ask Apollo to turn the chair
around. Do so with your stylus.
Now that we know the chair was
facing the wall, what doesn't
fit on the map? Point to the
killer's mark; if the victim was
facing the wall, then how could
the killer hit them from across
the table? He couldn't! When
asked to point out where the
killer was standing, point to
the cupboard in front of the
victim. But there's one problem:
there's no room for someone to
stand there! Unless... that
cupboard wasn't there! Phoenix
asks for the police to check the
cupboard at the scene of the
crime. Before the orders are
sent, Phoenix hands one more
thing over to the judge for the
police to investigate. Now, back
to the floor plans. Move the
cupboard to the side. Now
there's one more contradiction
remaining. What doesn't fit?
Point to the marker outside the
room; if the cupboard had moved,
then it would have blocked the
small window, making it
impossible to see inside! The
only way for Kristoph to have
seen the victim bald was if he
had stepped into the room and
hit the victim himself!

The police report back in with
the news: there was a secret
passage behind the cupboard
which leads back up into the
restaurant! This proves our
theory! Kristoph has one more
trick up his sleeve, however.
Phoenix's prints on the murder
weapon have yet to be explained.
Counter this with Olga's Photo;
if Phoenix reached down to the
crate and grabbed a bottle while
sitting on his piano bench, then
he'd grab the bottle by the
neck, and his prints would be
inverted. So Kristoph must have
replaced the real murder weapon
with a bottle he knew had
Phoenix's prints on them!
Phoenix asks the judge for the
other thing the police grabbed
while they were investigating
that cupboard: that crate of
bottled juice. In fact, they
brought one bottle back. Phoenix
asks Apollo to examine the
bottle. Again, turn the bottle
so that the label is no longer
visible. This time, however,
there's something inside. It's
the 5 of Hearts, the bait card
that Phoenix found before the
game! This proves that the
bottles were switched! Kristoph
pounds the stand as he admits
defeat.

Kristoph has admitted
everything, and Phoenix is warns
that a great change is coming to
the legal system in the future.
The judge declares Phoenix
Wright Not Guilty of murdering
Shadi Smith.

Well, with Kristoph carted off,
Apollo's out of a job. Phoenix
invites him to transfer over to
the Wright & Co. Law Offices,
saying that he knows that Apollo
has the potential to become a
great lawyer. Phoenix admits
that the locket wasn't his, but
he never said it was his in the
first place. In fact, he also
admits that he is no longer
qualified to stand in a court of
law. He asks Apollo to present
evidence that was false. Present
the Bloody Ace; it just seemed
too much of a miracle that
Kristoph would leave it behind.
Apollo, angered, decks Phoenix!
He just hands over his business
card and walks out the door.
Thus begins Apollo Justice's
journey towards the truth. Save
your game.

Case 2: Turnabout Corner
[TURNCORN]
--------------------------------

:DAY 1 " INVESTIGATION:

It's been 2 months since the
trial, and Apollo's hit rock-
bottom. Still, he never expected
to wind up at the Wright & Co.
Law Offices... Wait. This CAN'T
be the office we're all familiar
with! In a flash, Ms. Wright
shows up to interview the new
guy, under the pretense that
he's an actor. Apollo takes
another look at the sign out
front, and it says right there
that he's currently in the
"Wright Talent Agency"... Well,
that explains it. Ms. Wright
formally introduces herself as
Trucy, the manager of the
office. Talk to her about the
"Wright Talent Agency". Right
now, they only represent two
people: Trucy Wright, a magician
by trade, and Phoenix, the
piano/poker player. Now talk
about "Trucy Wright". She seems
to have a strange idea of how a
parent works. BTW, Trucy's only
15, and Phoenix is going on 33
this year. Now talk about
"Phoenix Wright". Trucy is a bit
suprised that Apollo knows a
little about the case that cost
Phoenix his badge. However,
that's not the important thing.
What's important is that Phoenix
is currently hospitalized at the
"Hickfield Clinic", and we're
moving there automatically.

Gah! It's that fake director
from the second game! Looks like
he got himself tossed out of the
Hotti Clinic... and he's still
as perverted as ever.
Fortunately, we don't have to
put up with him longer than we
have to as Phoenix shows up and
sends him on his way. Talk to
Phoenix about "What happened?"
It turns out that Phoenix ended
up the victim of a hit & run
crime. He hit a telephone pole,
but only got a sprained ankle
(Like Franziska from the Phoenix
Trilogy said, it's still hard to
tell whether he's lucky or
unlucky...). Now talk about
"About Trucy..." Apollo's still
finding it hard to believe that
Phoenix has a 15-year-old
daughter, but they sure act like
they're related. Phoenix also
calls her a "genius", but why is
beyond me at the moment. Now
talk about the "Wright Talent
Agency". Phoenix made it sound
like a big deal when he called
in. Well, the agency only
represents the two of them,
which means that they might be a
little tight on cash for a
while. Phoenix asks Apollo to
work at the agency for a while,
and he already has a client
waiting for him. However, the
end of that conversation has me
a little worried... Now talk
about "Our client". Phoenix
hands Apollo a map of the city,
explaining what happened that
night. Phoenix was on his way to
Alden Tae's, an Indochine pasta
restaurant (the patrons had
better covered their ears...)
That's when the driver hit him
with the car. The car zoomed
towards the vicinity of the
office. And we care... why?
Because Phoenix is the client!
We're not detectives, you know.
And we're not prosecutors
either. Phoenix laughs Apollo
off, saying that the real client
is currently waiting at the
office. The map of the city will
be added to the court record.
Head on over to the "Wright
Talent Agency".

Why is this guy wearing a bowl
as a hat? And is that his real
hair even? As Trucy explains,
this is Guy Eldoon, the owner of
Eldoon's Noodles. Contrary to
what we're expecting, he's
looking for a detective, not a
lawyer: his noodle stand was
stolen recently. Talk to him
about "Who's this guy?" As
explained before, he's the owner
of Eldoon's Noodles. He's the
fifteenth Eldoon running the
stand, but Guy wanted to do
something else with his life,
and picked out another
occupation. But that fell
through, so he became a noodle
vendor, like his father before
him. Now talk about "Eldoon's
Noodles". Phoenix and his
assistants have been dining
there since the fourteenth
Eldoon was running the stand.
But Apollo won't get the chance
to try them, since Elddon's
stand was stolen. Now talk about
the "Stolen stand". It happened
last night. Eldoon was on his
way back home, blowing his
whistle, and when he got there,
he tuned up his cart and went to
bed. When he woke up later, he
discovered that his cart had
been stolen. That's why he needs
Apollo's help to find his noodle
stand (AGAIN with the detective
schtick!). He'll also point out
where he lives. Trucy confesses
that she has her own share of
problems: that same night,
someone stole her panties! Talk
about "Trucy's request". It
happened when Trucy was in the
office: she was hanging them out
to dry when someone snatched
them! She chased the thief, but
lost them. Eldoon asks that
Apollo also helps Trucy with her
problem. So far, we have a hit &
run, a cart theft, and a panty
snatching to investigate. Oy
vey. Head to the "Accident
Scene".

Looks like the accident happened
right in front of this mansion.
There's a lady out sweeping the
ground with a broom, but she has
a pretty husky voice. When she
mentions that the mansion
belongs to the Kitaki Family,
Apollo freaks out, and with
reason: the Kitakis are the
biggest mobsters in town! The
woman introduces herself as Plum
Kitaki. Talk to her about "The
Kitakis". Trucy has no idea of
the trouble she'll get in if she
rubs Plum the wrong way, but she
sets her straight, and just
laughs as Apollo tries to keep
Trucy quiet. They've been
working hard to maintain their
fortune (ill-gotten, I'll
bet...), and it's not an easy
task. Now talk to her about
"Last night's accident". Plum
actually saw Phoenix get hit,
and one of their Capos (short
for caporegime, they're like
captains in the mafia) thought
he'd make a great point man.
When the accident happened, some
paint was knocked over, and Plum
has been spending most of the
morning cleaning up. Now talk
about "Splattered paint". It was
the Boss of the family (Plum's
husband) that helped Phoenix up
and got him to the hospital.
Trucy is wondering why she
doesn't have one of the "goons"
clean up, and Plum just laughs.
They're the type of gangsters
that give back to the community.
Plum picked up some trash and
threw it away in a public trash
can. Time to check the other
side of this scene out.

As soon as you do, an unknown
woman, looking really worried,
is just standing there, but
she'll leave in a flash. Examine
the trash can instead. Inside
are two things coated a bit by
paint: a pair of slippers and a
side-view mirror. When asked to
take one, take the mirror; it
may have something to do with
the hit & run. Next, examine the
entrance to the park. The
officer on guard won't let us
in, and some woman wearing a
white lab coat comes to see what
all the commotion is about. For
some odd reason, she looks
awfully familiar. Anyways,
she'll also tell Apollo and
Trucy to buzz off. Maybe Plum
has a better idea as to what's
going on. Talk to Plum about
"People Park". Well, last night,
a murder occured in the park!
But we don't have a client yet,
so we can't go in and look
further. Something also happened
at the mansion too, and I don't
think we have the luxury of
refusing to hear about it. Last
night, someone stole Plum's
bloomers! Will the snatching
never cease!? Well, we have one
more person to worry about
now... The woman from before
(NOT the one in the lab coat)
comes by and says hello to
"mother". Is she a Kitaki too!?
Trucy senses something off about
her and hands her a flyer to the
Wright ANYTHING Agency (looks
like Trucy's been at it
again...). The woman takes the
flyer and leaves. Well, nothing
more to do here, so let's see
what Eldoon's up to. Head to the
"Scene of the Stand Theft".

Well, I wouldn't really call
that a house. It's more like a
run-down shack. Next to the
shack is a building called the
"Meraktis Clinic". Of note is
the fact that a police car is
parked out front. Trucy
remembers suddenly that her
panty-snatcher ran into the
garage! Well, we're that much
closer to finding them. Eldoon
shows up, whining that he can't
sell his wares. Talk to him
about "Eldoon's Noodles". That
stand was passed down from
father to son, and now the
antique is gone. Now talk about
the "Stolen stand". I already
gave more information than I
needed to up above, so read up
if you want to! BTW, everything
that Eldoon needed to run his
business was in that stand as
well. At least they left one
bowl behind. Now talk about "The
garage". It's mostly a recap of
info, but Eldoon seems to have a
bit of animosity with his
neighbor. Examine the bowl on
the ground. That bowl will be
added to the court record. Now
examine the cop car parked
outside. The police have shut
down the clinic and no one can
enter. Talk to Eldoon about the
"Meraktis Clinic". Even Eldoon
has no idea on what's going on
there, and the police have given
him no info whatsoever. But he
has a nagging suspicion about
the head doctor being with the
"wrong crowd", whatever that
means. Time to look for some
panties. Head to the "Meraktis
Clinic - Garage".

Examine the green car, and we'll
zoom in for a closer look.
First, look in the tailpipe:
something's lodged in there.
Trucy yells out and proclaims
that her panties have been
found! Suddenly, she pulls a
bowl out of her panties! She
explains that these are used in
her "Magic Panties" trick. Why
didn't she tell us that they
were a prop!? Trucy's panties
will be added to the court
record. The only thing left now
is to find out who stole them in
the first place. We'll return to
examining the car. Examine the
pinkish thing sticking out from
behind the tire. It's a cell
phone, but what's it doing
there? The Cell Phone will be
added to the court record. Now
examine the wiring sticking out
from the car. The side-view
mirror's gone! Choose "Show
evidence" and present the
Mirror. It's a perfect match!
Well, at least we know where
that car went off to after
hitting Phoenix. Head on over
the "Hickfield Clinic", via the
"Wright Anything Agency".

Talk to Phoenix about a
"Progress report". Phoenix
wasn't expecting us to be back
so quickly. After all, we did
find Trucy's panties. When
Phoenix learns that the guy who
hit him was from the Meraktis
Clinic, he comments on the
"wrong crowd" that Eldoon
mentioned. Next, talk about the
"Meraktis Clinic". The clinic
has been making tons of dough
due to their connections to
organized crime, specifically,
the Kitaki Family. There are
some injuries that you just
can't take to a regular
hospital, which is why they use
the Meraktis Clinic for
assistance. Now talk about
"People Park". The body of the
victim was found in unusual
circumstances. Phoenix says that
the murder is of no concern to
the agency. Apollo's wondering
when he gets paid, but Phoenix
has nothing on him. Bon voyage,
money tree! Head back to the
office.

It's that woman again! She
finally introduces herself as
Alita Tiala (Huh? She's NOT part
of the family!?). She has a
defense request for Apollo to
take on. FINALLY! Talk about
"Your request". She wants Apollo
to defend her fiancee in a
murder case. Now talk about
"Tiala's story". She's not part
of the Family... yet. Her
fiancee is the Boss's son, and
she thought it'd be a nice
change of pace to be a gangster.
Now talk about the "Murder in
the park". She's not sure of the
details herself. Great. The
victim was shot with a pistol,
but there are those strange
circumstances. Her fiancee is
the prime suspect in the murder.
Now talk about "Your fiancee".
His name is Wocky, and she
brought a photo of him with her.
Wow... he looks kinda like a
fox. She wants Apollo to help
him out at the trial tomorrow.
She also has a letter of request
for the two, and that letter
will be added to the court
record. Time to talk with our
client. Head to the "Detention
Center".

What? He's still in questioning?
Well, that sucks. Head back to
the "Kitaki Mansion".

What's with the bike out front?
The officer spots them again,
and even when he's shown the
letter of request, he still
refuses them entry. Drat! Just
then, some guy with a weird
necklace comes up and asks the
"fraulein" (German for "lady")
what's wrong. Is it just me, or
does this guy look an awful lot
like Kristoph? When Trucy tells
the man that the guard is
denying them entry, he escorts
the two of them to "People
Park".

The Kristoph look-alike leaves
the scene and in comes the lab
coated detective. She examines
the letter and confrims the
handwriting belongs to Ms.
Tiala. She also says that when
the body was found, it was
pulling the stand. She
introduces herself as Ema Skye
(I KNEW she looked familiar!).
Talk to her about anything.
She's busy chomping down on
snackoos, but she does mention
that she's disappointed that
"he's" not an attorney anymore.
Is she hinting what I think
she's hinting? Examine the cart.
Ema will tell them not to touch
anyting, but the cart has
Eldoon's name on it. Well, at
least we found it. Move back to
the Hickfield Clinic.

Apollo will mention the defense
request from Ms. Tiala, but
Phoenix gets the wrong idea
until Apollo sets him straght.
Talk to him about the "Murder".
Phoenix thinks that Eldoon's
stand was used as a weapon, and
again, Apollo sets him straight.
Trucy mentions the detective,
and Phoenix seems to recognize
the description. Now talk about
the "Skye connection". You'll
know all about this if you
played case 1-5 of the Phoenix
Trilogy. Trucy will aslo mention
the Kristoph look-alike, calling
him a "prince". Talk about the
"Mysterious Prince". When Apollo
describes him, Phoenix explains
that the look-alike is actually
Kristoph's younger brother,
Klavier Gavin, a popular rock
star. But what was Klavier doing
near the scene of the crime?
Phoenix then explains how to
best brighten Ema's mood. He
tells Apollo to head back to the
office and look for a white
powder under the top hat. Take
his advice.

Again, the powder will be
familiar if you've played
through case 1-5. It's
fingerprinting powder! It will
be added (as White Powder) to
the court record. Head on back
to "People Park".

Present the White Powder to Ema.
She'll immediately recognize the
powder for what it is, and seems
shocked to be standing in front
of Phoenix's protege and
daughter. She immedately decides
to help them out in any way
possible. That powder is a
memento of her time spent with
Phoenix. We can now FINALLY talk
with her. Talk about "The case".
Ema has no clue as to why the
victim was pulling the stand. We
already knew about the pistol,
but of note is that the victim
was shot in the right temple.
It's not easy to come by a gun.
About the only way you could get
your hands on one was if you
became a cop... or a gangster.
The victim was one Pal Meraktis.
Ema just recieved the autopsy
report, and will give a copy of
it to us. Meraktis's Autopsy
Report will be added to the
court record. Ema doesn't know
who the stand belongs to, so,
when prompted, present Eldoon's
profile. Ema's impressed with
the info, as that's a world of
stress off her back. The Noodle
Stand will be added to the court
record. Ema mentions that
Meraktis was a doctor. Are you
thinking what I'm thinking? Now
talk about "Your story". She
just returned from studying
forensic sciences in Europe. But
when she got back, she was
unceremoniously shoved into
Criminal Affairs. Ema DID have
the option of being a forensic
scientist in Europe, but she
owed Phoenix too much to just
stay there, and came back.
Again, she refrences case 1-5.
Now talk about "The defendant".
Wocky's cetainly being rough in
the detention center. As to why
he was arrested, the police have
a witness to the scene, and
they'll be testifying tomorrow.

Now talk about "The victim". He
was the head of the Meraktis
Clinic before he died, and she's
shocked when she learns that
Apollo and Trucy have been there
already. Apollo tells Ema all
about the stand theft. Ema comes
to the conclusion that Meraktis
stole the stand, but she has no
idea why he would do that.
Examine the trash can. Inside is
a pair of bloomers! Could they
belong to Plum? The Bloomers
will be added to the court
record. Next, examine the knife
stuck in the ground. Well, to be
accurate, it's actually a shiv
(an improvised sharp tool
favored by inmates already in
the clink). Could this belong to
Wocky? There's a handprint on
the shiv. Ema wants to
investigate it further by taking
fingerprints. Ema will teach
Apollo and Trucy about taking
fingerprints (though if you've
played through case 1-5, you'll
already know how to do this...).
Select the darkest black indent
and spread the powder, then blow
into the mic. Now, based on the
available information, whose
fingerprints are these? Select
Wocky's profile. It's a perfect
match! Double drat, this means
that Wocky was on the scene when
the murder took place! The Knife
will be added to the court
record. Visiting hours are
almost over at the detention
center, so head on down there,
and step on it!

Three minutes are left and Wocky
is brought out, along with his
father, Winfred "Big Wins"
Kitaki (this guy looks a LOT
like Vito Corleone... but what's
with the cute yellow apron!?).
Winfred assures Apollo that
Wocky is innocent of the charges
laid against him. Apollo vows to
see Wocky aquitted as visitation
ends. Save your game.

:DAY 2 " TRIAL, PART 1:

Phoenix is still in the
hospital, getting his
examinations done. Phoenix also
said that as long as Trucy's
here, we'll be A-OK. Apollo also
shows off his voice training
skills to Trucy as Wocky walks
up. The trial's beginning, and
we still haven't had a talk with
Wocky! Looks like a no- win
situation here.

Standing behind the prosecutor's
bench is... Klavier!? He's a
prosecutor too!? Well, this was
unexpected. He hasn't been
coming to court recently not
because of the case 7 years ago,
but because the band he started
in his free time became popular
overnight. He's here today to
see what the man who defeated
his brother is capable of. He
even had to cancel a couple of
concerts in order to make it!
Klavier gets the court hopping
by playing one of his latest
hits and gives out his opening
statement. As explained earlier,
Dr. Meraktis's body was found
pulling the noodle stand in
People Park. Why? Klaiver
suggests hearing the defendant's
testimony. Apollo objects,
saying that Wocky will do
nothing of the sort. Klavier
counters by informing the court
that Wocky has requested that he
testify. He'll be brought up to
the stand. Wocky will now
testify about his motive.

WOCKY KITAKI'S TESTIMONY: WOCKY
KITAKI'S "TRUTH"
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I'll tell you one thing, that d

-Someone had to show him what's 

-I was in his clinic 'bout half 
bad.

-And then he just lets me go, wi

-So I gotta go in, get another d

-That was the day I done figured

-That's why I went to his pad th

I can't believe that this is the
first time he's telling us his
motive! Start by pressing his
third statement, the one about
the botched operation. Wocky was
involved in a firefight with the
Rivales Family, and was taken to
the clinic when he was shot in
the heart. It's amazing that
he's still alive! Press his next
statement, the one about Dr.
Meraktis letting him go. Dr.
Meraktis didn't want the Family
to know that the operation was a
failure, and let him go, while
lying through his teeth. Press
his next statement, the one
abour needing another doctor. It
turns out that the bullet's
still in there, and he only
found out after the Family went
to have a check-up. That's why
he wanted him dead: revenge.
Klavier goes further by stating
that if that bullet isn't
removed soon, he'll die. He'll
add Wocky's Check-Up Report to
the court record as proof. THAT
shuts Wocky's trap, and Klavier
calls the witness to the stand.

Is this guy some sort of
student? His name is Wesley
Stickler, a junior in Ivy
University's science department.
He'll testify as to the events
that transpired that night.

WESLEY STICKLER'S FIRST
TESTIMONY: A NIGHT IN THE PARK
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night, I passed through th
when I saw them!

-One man, pulling a stand. Anoth

-I saw them quite clearly. The m

-In his hand he held... yes, a p
the stand.

-A shot! The bullet hit the man 
in the forehead!

Stickler claims that no one else
was in the park at the time of
the murder. The pistol in
question will be added to the
court record. Time for the
cross-examination. Present the
autopsy report against his last
statement, the one about the
victim being shot in the
forehead; the autopsy report
clearly says that the victim was
shot in his right temple!
Klavier counters (calling Apollo
"Herr Forehead") by asking the
witness if he shouted out.
Stickler answers with another
testimony.

WESLEY STICKLER'S SECOND
TESTIMONY: A NIGHT IN THE PARK 2
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-As soon as the killer raised hi

-"Cease this at once, you two!" 

-The victim turned in the direct

-Whereupon our cowardly killer, 
frightened.

-Tossing the pistol aside, he fl

NO! The victim turned his head
to the south, then he was shot!?
This testimony overturns our
objection! Let's start again,
shall we? Present the pistol
against Stickler's last
statement, the one about the
killer throwing away the pistol;
if he had thrown it away,
Wocky's fingerprints would have
been found on the weapon! Plus,
if he ran in a hurry, he
wouldn't have had time to wipe
the gun clean of fingerprints!
Klavier counters by saying that
Wocky may have been wearing
gloves at the time. Was Wocky
wearing gloves? Answer "No way".
There are still traces of
fingerprints left on the pistol.
Stickler counters that this
revelation changes nothing: he
still saw the defendant pointing
a weapon at the doctor. But did
he see the pistol? Maybe not.
Present the Knife as proof; we
already know that this belongs
to Wocky. Maybe he was pointing
this at the victim! However,
Klavier points out that this
proves Wocky was on the scene at
the time and he had intened to
cause the victim harm! Doh! The
judge asks Wesley to revise his
testimony.

WESLEY STICKLER'S THIRD
TESTIMONY: FROM SHOT TO CALL
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I could not prevent the killer 

-Nor could I simply leave the sc

-Ergo! I used my cell phone to c

-Until the police arrived at the
else.

Press Stickler's first
statement, the one about being
unable to contain the murderer.
Wesley saw the killer run in the
opposite direction, but Klavier
knows what Apollo's up to: if
Wocky ran away from the mansion,
all he had to do was go around
one way to get back. Press his
next statement, the one about
being unable to leave with a
clear conscience. Stickler was
quite composed as he saw the
scene unfold: he is, after all,
a scientist in the making. Press
his next statement, the one
about calling the police. He
didn't call an ambulance first,
because being shot in the head
usually results in instant
death. Finally, press his last
statement, the one about him not
seeing anyone else. He's quite
sure of himself, because he was
standing there the whole time.

There's nothing wrong with the
testimony! Grrr! Say "yes": it's
time to back off. Sorry, Wocky.
But just as the judge is about
to declare a verdict, someone
screams! It's Trucy!!! And with
her is a tall, dark man holding
a knife to her throat! The man
demands a recess or he'll kill
her! Just before they disappear,
Trucy tells Apollo to come to
the lobby. The judge, having no
choice, declares a twenty minute
recess. Those Kitakis are in
soooooo much trouble! Save your
game.

:DAY 2 " TRIAL, PART 2:

Trucy's just fine in the
defendant lobby. Apollo swears
to get back at the Kitakis, but
Trucy has different plans: in a
flash, she activates some hidden
switch and out pops some sort of
wooden puppet that grabs her
hat! What!? The guy that
kidnapped Trucy was actually a
puppet!? This is one of her
favorite tricks, the Amazing Mr.
Hat. Apollo admonishes Trucy for
staging her own kidnapping, but
Trucy had to do what she felt
like she had to do: to keep the
trial going. She had to because
she knows when the witness is
unsure of himself. She can
"percieve" his nervous habits!
Uhhh... what? Choose either one
of the answers to move on. She
could see every time that when
there was a contradiction, he
did something: he fiddled with
the pages in his book. It was
this ability, the ability to see
someone's nervous habits, that
gave Phoenix his winning streak
in poker. She believes that
being able to read someone's
tells isn't really cheating. She
implores Apollo to watch the
testimony and to percieve the
truth, because, for some odd
reason, Apollo has the same
ability that Trucy has. Time to
head back in.

The judge seems a bit baffled to
see Trucy safe and sound, but
Klavier seems to have known that
it was a ruse all along. Apollo
asks to hear Stickler's
testimony again, and the judge
allows it.

WESELY STICKLER'S THIRD
TESTIMONY: FROM SHOT TO CALL
(REDUX)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I could not prevent the killer 

-Nor could I simply leave the sc

-Ergo! I used my cell phone to c

-Until the police arrived at the
else.

As Apollo concentrates on
Stickler, he gets a strange
reaction from his bracelet.
Could it be the key to unlocking
his power? This time around,
press his third statement, the
one about calling the police.
This time, Trucy notices that
this is where Stickler's weak
spot is. Apollo also notices his
bracelet reacting to this spot.
Either touch the bracelet icon
or press the Y button to
percieve the truth!

Welcome to the Percieve System.
On the upper screen is the
witness, and on the lower screen
is the witness' zoomed-in
version. It doesn't really do us
any good if we're not looking at
the right place, so either use
the control pad or the stylus to
focus on his book hand. When he
fiddles with the page (when he
says "I used my cell phone"),
press the Y button or touch the
"Percieve" button to lock that
motion in. Now you too can
finally yell "Gotcha!" into the
mic if you so desire it. Well,
now this cell phone has me
intrigued. "Ask to see his
phone". Unfortunately, Stickler
lost his phone, so he doesn't
have it on him. Apollo shows him
the phone we have in the court
record. Bingo, it's his phone,
alright. Remember, we found this
phone at the Meraktis Clinic. If
he didn't have his cell phone
that night, then how did he call
the police?

Stickler confesses that after
the murder, he left the park to
use a pay phone. The pay phone
in question is located across
the street from the agency.
That's why he lied: he didn't
want anyone to know that he had
lost his phone in the clinic's
garage. But why would he be
there in the first place? Can we
even prove that he was there the
night of the murder? Choose to
"Show evidence". Present the
Mirror; Dr. Meraktis had hit
Phoenix that night, remember?
Plus, if that cell phone was
there before Dr. Meraktis had
come back, then it would've been
crushed. This proves that he was
there that night! The judge asks
Stickler to testify as to the
reason why he was in the garage
that night.

WESELY STICKLER'S FINAL
TESTIMONY: STICKLER'S "TRUTH"
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night... Yes! I went to th

-I must have dropped my cell pho

-And when I was walking through 
crime!

-...I saw the killer, the victim

-It was him! I saw the defendant

No nervous habits here, which
means we fall back on our old
standbys. Start by pressing his
fourth statement, the one about
the stand, and ask him about
"The noodle stand". Stickler
remembers the stand well, and
even remembers what the sign
read. It was "NOODLE". Is this
important? Oh, yes, it is "Very
important". Stickler will now
amend his testimony:

-Why, I even remember the sign o
said "NOODLE"!

No it didn't. Take a look at the
cart. It says "ELDOON". Present
the Noodle Stand against this
statement. Now the question
becomes, did the witness read
the sign wrong? Take a closer
look at the stand: the reverse
side reads "NOODLE", just as
Stickler claimed. So, Mr.
Stickler saw the sign "and he
saw it right." Next, point up a
bit to the north to pinpoint
Stickler's location. Stickler
didn't see the murder from the
south! He saw it from the north!
Klavier objects, saying that
where the witness was standing
is irrelevant. Trucy counters by
going over the events of the
crime again: if Mr. Stickler had
shouted from the north instead
of the south, then the bullet
would've hit the victim's left
temple, not his right! But if
Stickler was standing to the
north, he would've had a clean
shot at the victim's right
temple! Is Stickler the real
murderer? No, but he doesn't
look too innocent either. Choose
"Accuse of another crime". What
is this crime? Think back to the
garage. What else was there?
That's right, the panties! Maybe
Stickler was the one that stole
those panties! Present Trucy's
Panties as proof. Boy, what a
pervert he turned out to be.

Stickler provides an
explanation: he didn't steal the
panties because he was a
pervert, he stole them to
examine them: he's a regular at
the Wonder Bar (where Trucy
often performs), and when he saw
those panties, he dedicated
himself to uncovering their
secrets. But then that begs the
question, "why did he lie about
his location at the time of the
murder?" Present the Bloomers;
maybe he disposed of those
bloomers in case he was searched
by the police! Stickler admits
it: he hated having to part with
the subject of his research, but
he had to in order to escape the
long arm of the law.

The judge dismisses Mr. Stickler
from the stand, calling his
testimony into question. Klavier
points out that while the entry
wound has yet to be explained,
he's proven that Wocky was on
the scene with intent to kill.
The judge decides to extend the
trial to the next day. Time for
some more investigative legwork.
Save your game.

:DAY 2 " INVESTIGATION:

What a disaster that trial was.
Good thing Wocky managed to get
out of there for another day.
Alita shows up, congradulating
Apollo on a job well done. The
way things are going, they'll be
able to hold the wedding on
time. Talk to her about the
"Marriage". She doesn't seem all
that put off about marrying into
a gangster family. Alita
mentions that they met at her
previous job, but she's mum
about the details. Next, talk
about "The Kitakis". Winfred's
dead set on getting the family
out of the shadier side of
business, but Wocky's against
that. He's equally dead set on
keeping the gangster tradition
alive. Next, talk about "Wocky's
condition". Dr. Meraktis covered
up the fact that he messed up
Wocky's operation, and that's
really scary. Methinks it's time
to visit the clinic again. Alita
will excuse herself, saying that
she believes in Apollo. Move to
the detention center.

Well, Wocky isn't here, but
Stickler is. Talk to him about
being a "Panty-snatcher". He
only stole those panties because
he wanted to understand how the
trick worked. He even begs Trucy
to take him on as an apprentice
to find out! Next, talk about
"What you witnessed". While he
may have lied about where he was
when the murder occured, he
still saw Wocky shoot the
victim. However, his testimony
flies in the face of the
evidence: the victim was shot in
the right temple, not the left.
We've heard pretty much
everything we needed to from
this guy, so head to the
mansion.

Plum's back out here today. Talk
to her about "Wocky". Plum knows
her son too well to think that
he could have shot a pistol.
Plus, Winfred and Wocky are at
odds with each other. Now talk
about "The case". Plum confesses
that they're missing a pistol.
Only a family member could have
taken that gun. That's why the
police are here today: to
investigate the mansion. Next,
talk about "Alita Tiala". Plum
can't shake the feeling that
Alita's got some sort of dark
secret, but she supposes that
that's due to her being a
gangster for so long. Now, talk
about "Father and son". Winfred
may be as tough as nails, but
when it comes to Wocky, he'll do
anything for him. Wocky,
however, dislikes the fact that
they're going to do legitimate
business. Plum explains that
it's because they need a lot of
clean money, and fast. She hopes
that Wocky will see things his
father's way one day. Examine
the trash can again. This time,
the Slippers will be added to
the court record. Move to
"Eldoon's House".

Eldoon's glad that his stand was
found, but he still can't use it
since it's part of the crime
scene. He also blames Meraktis
for this state of affairs! Talk
to him about "The noodle stand".
That stand has been in the
family for generations, but
Eldoon tried to get away from
it. He was almost successful
too... until Meraktis showed up.
Apollo asks Eldoon what he did
before running the stand, but
Eldoon refuses to talk. Now talk
about the "Meraktis Clinic".
Eldoon confesses to his hatred
towards Meraktis. Meraktis is
the only doctor at that clinic,
BTW. When Meraktis saw the
potential of the turf wars, he
cut the Kitaki Family a bit of a
deal: "Every fifth operation is
free!" Sure, it was illegal, but
thanks to that ploy, Eldoon was
forced to fall back on his
noodle stand. Is it just me, or
was Mr. Eldoon formerly DR.
Eldoon? Ask about "Eldoon's
past". Eldoon admits it: until
two years ago, he was a surgeon
running his own clinic. He and
Meraktis have been rivals ever
since they were in pre-school.
No matter what Eldoon did,
Meraktis would come and
completely outdo him. Well,
Eldoon may have a motive, but I
just don't see him as a
murderer. Eldoon decides to make
up to Apollo and Trucy by
telling them anything they want
to know about Meraktis, if
they're stuck. It takes a doctor
to know a doctor. Scroll to the
other side of the screen. The
officer on duty won't let them
in, due to the fact that they
believe that the clinic is
unrelated to the murder, save
for the fact that Meraktis ran
the clinic. Head to the
detention center.

Wocky's out of questioning,
which means that we can finally
talk with him! Talk to him about
"Your fiancee". He is completely
taken with her. Since Alita
never mentioned the details of
how they met, Wocky won't talk
about it either. Next, talk
about the "Meraktis Clinic".
It's mostly a review. Next, talk
about "Wocky's future". Again,
it's mostly a review. Now,
present the Pistol or the Knife
to him. He snuck both of those
weapons out that night. Now,
talk about "The night of the
crime". When asked if he shot
Dr. Meraktis, Wocky says that he
only remembers confronting him,
then running away. That middle
part is a little hazy. Ok, so he
may have done it, or he may NOT
have done it. That's a good
thing. Move to the mansion.

Looks like Klavier is here
again, and this time, he's
surrounded by fangirls. He was
on his way back home when his
bike stopped running. It got a
clogged exhaust pipe, thanks to
him using the wrong oil. No
matter if it's a bike or a car,
the engine won't start with
clogged pipes. He's on his way
to get help for his bike (that,
and Ema isn't too fond of
him...). Head on into the park.

The tarps surronding the cart
are gone! What's up? Ema's in a
foul mood, just like Klavier
tells us. She's been trying a
new investigation kit (and
failing to utilize it correctly,
apparently...). Talk to her
about "Detective Skye". The
reason she was put into Criminal
Affairs was because she failed
the test to become a forensic
scientist. Now talk about
"Prosecutor Gavin". She prefers
her prosecutors to be more
"simmerous" than "glimmerous"
(sound like a certain frilled
prosecutor to you?) Plus, it was
Klavier that took Phoenix's
badge from him. Huh? Why didn't
Phoenix mention this? Now talk
about "The new kit?" It's a
footprint analysis kit. She's
been having a bit of trouble to
get it to work. She'll ask
Apollo if he wants to try it. Go
ahead and "Try it". We'll
automatically zoom in and look
at a footprint. You have to fill
the indent left by the shoe with
plaster. Use too much of the
plaster, and you'll have to
start over. To pour the plaster,
simply touch with your stylus in
the place you want it to go (Ema
will do one for you). When Ema
says that you've poured enough
plaster, we'll move on to step
two. Use the stylus to handle
the dryer and turn all of the
plaster white (again, Ema will
demonstrate). When it's all
white, Ema will take out the
finished product for step three.
Use the stylus on the handle of
the ink roller to spread the ink
on the plaster. Ema will tell
you if you've spread enough ink.
Finally, Ema will use a piece of
paper to reproduce the print.
Now we must match the shoe to
its owner. Select Wocky's
profile. It's a match! Wocky was
on the scene at the time of the
crime!

Talk to Ema about "Footprint
analysis". This time, point to
the green prints and go through
the process. Select Stickler's
profile. This verifies his
testimony: when he witnessed the
shooting, he was standing to the
north of the cart. Talk to Ema
about "Another shoe print".
Select the last print that we
haven't done yet. This print
doesn't belong to anyone on our
list, and that's not good.
Before talking to Ema, examine
the Slippers closer. Look at the
bottom: there's a strange leaf-
shaped mark there surrounded by
paint. Huh. Deja vu. NOW talk to
Ema about the "Mystery print".
Ema has no clue what shoe this
belongs to. Choose to "Show
evidence" and present the
Slippers. Not only does the
shape on the bottom show that
these are the mystery shoes,
they belong to the clinic! Kinda
hard to say the two aren't
related now. Ema will help out
by giving Apollo Detective
Skye's Orders. Head back to
Eldoon's place.

When shown the orders, the
officer has no choice but to let
Apollo and Trucy into the
clinic. Move to the "Meraktis
Clinic".

Right now, we're in the lobby.
See all those bowls? They look
awfully familiar, don't you
think? Next, examine those fancy
slippers on the ground. What are
they doing here? Suspicious,
Apollo will add the Sandals to
the court record. Now, examine
the door to the office.
Suddenly, there's a noise!
Apollo and Trucy will rush into
the office.

Someone broke in! There's no way
to catch them now, but they must
have been in a hurry. Examine
the lamp on the ground: the cord
has a strange pinkish splotch on
it. The Lamp will be added to
the court record. Next, examine
the safe. As we zoom in, we'll
find that someone's already
entered the first two numbers of
a four digit lock! What was that
burglar after? When asked about
what could help identify the
last two numbers, answer "I've
got just the thing!" and present
the Fingerprint Powder. If
someone was to open the safe,
they had to touch the buttons,
and that would leave
fingerprints! Spread the powder
all over the keypad and blow
away. Unfortunately, the burglar
must have worn gloves, since we
can't identify any fingerprints.
Now to open the safe: press 5,
then
2. The safe will open revealing
   its contents. Examine the big
   envelope.
They're Wocky's medical charts!
But why would they be in here?
And what does all of that
gibberish mean? The names,
however, are easy to understand.
Of course, Wocky was the patient
and Meraktis was the doctor, but
the nurse's name is Alita Tiala!
Why would her name be on this
document? Wocky's Chart will be
added to the court record. Next,
examine that thing sticking out
in the safe. It's a bullet! But
why was that bullet there? The
Bullet will be added to the
court record. Head back to the
park.

Present either the Slippers or
the Sandals to Ema. She'll say
that the toe prints may identify
who wore them, but there's one
problem: the police don't keep
records of people's toe prints.
Rats! Anyways, examine both the
Slippers and the Sandals in more
detail: both have a blackish
mark on them, indicating the
presence of toe prints. They're
both big toe prints. Now present
either the Slippers or the
Sandals to Ema again. She'll
comment on the prints and ask
for a sample for refrence.
Answer "Got one right here". Now
present the other (e.g., if you
presented the Slippers first,
present the Sandals) shoe to
Ema. She'll determine that the
same person wore both shoes. But
we're still no closer to finding
out who wore them. Maybe Wocky
can enlighten us. For now,
though, head to the Hickfield
Clinic.

Talk to Phoenix about "7 years
ago". Phoenix confirms that he
was up against Klavier (who was
17 at the time, but he was
raised in Germany) in his final
trial. He lost and, in shame,
left the practice forever.
Apollo asks Phoenix about the
rumors of forgery. Now talk
about "Forged evidence". Phoenix
neither denies or admits that he
forged evidence. Time to let the
matter drop. Head back to the
detention center.

Talk to Wocky about the possible
"Guilty verdict". He's still
unsure whether he killed
Meraktis or not, but he's not
scared about the verdict one
bit. Now talk about "Your
father". He wants nothing to do
with his yellow-bellied father,
and when he gets out, he and
Alita will start their own
family. Present Wocky's Chart.
Wocky reveals that he first met
Alita during his recovery at the
clinic. Now talk about "Wocky &
Alita". She was bored with her
job and Wocky offered to take
her in. Alita agreed on one
condition: that they get
married. When Wocky left the
clinic, Alita left with him. Now
talk about the "Health check-
up". That was one strange thing:
it was the first time that they
had a check-up ever. But, due to
that, Wocky learned that
Meraktis lied to him. Finally,
present the Sandals to Wocky. He
reveals that he bought those for
Alita as a birthday present. If
that's true, then she wore those
slippers we found in the park!
But why was she there in the
first place? Move back to
Eldoon's house.

Present Wocky's Chart to Eldoon.
Eldoon suddenly blurts out that
Wocky shouldn't be on trial: he
should be under the knife!
Eldoon takes his bowl-hat off
and takes on his surgeon
persona. Talk to him about
"Wocky's chart". Eldoon surmises
that Meraktis was unable to
remove the bullet, not
unwilling. The bullet's
surrounded by major blood
vessels (the aorta): one wrong
move, and Wocky would've bled to
death. Now talk about
"Meraktis's dilemma". Eldoon has
to feel sorry for Meraktis,
imagining the situation: he even
admits that he couldn't do it.
But there's still one
outstanding issue: Alita's
engagement. Why would she ask
Wocky to marry her if she
already knew he was going to
die? It looks like we may be
coming down to the wire. Save
your game.

:DAY 3 " TRIAL:

In the lobby, Phoenix (who just
signed out from the Hickfield
Clinic) informs Apollo that
Alita will testify for the
prosecution. Why? Isn't she
engaged to Wocky? This question
and more will be answered during
the trial.

In court, Klavier calls Alita as
someone with a new perspective
on the case. She admits that she
can't hide the truth anymore
when she takes the stand.
Klavier will ask her to testify
about Wocky's plans for the
doctor.

ALITA TIALA'S FIRST TESTIMONY:
WOCKY'S PLAN
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-It was the day that the family 

-When Wocky found out that Dr. M

-"I'll teach him!" he said. He t

-...And, you already know what h

-I... just don't see how anyone 

The pistol that was used to kill
the victim came from the family,
and as Apollo explains, the
rifling marks (the fingerprints
of a bullet) prove it beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

Start by pressing her final
statement, the one about how no
one but Wocky could have killed
the victim. Klavier objects
right away, repeating that only
Wocky could have done it. Is
there another person? Answer
"There was another". According
to Alita's testimony, someone
else could have used that
pistol. As to who, present
Alita's profile; Wocky came to
her to tell her that he was
going to kill him. She could
have stolen the pistol from him
while they talked! But why would
she take that pistol? Present
Wocky's Chart: she needed to get
that chart before Wocky could
see it to protect herself!
Suddenly, Alita becomes a total
ice queen. She was at the clinic
until half a year ago, until she
quit. When she quit, her
connection with the victim was
cut. Grrrr! To prove that she's
still connected with the clinic,
present Alita's Sandals. We
found these in the clinic's
lobby, remember? Alita will now
testify about her visit to the
clinic that night.

ALITA TIALA'S SECOND TESTIMONY:
THE MERAKTIS CLINIC
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I did go to the clinic that day

-I went to warn him. After all, 

-The doctor always was a timid m
mistake.

-Why else would I have gone? I'm

-I wanted to tell him to be care

Klavier steps in at this point,
asking why Alita didn't wear her
sandals on her way home, and
suggests at the same time that
she took a similar pair instead,
and she confirms. Oh, really?
Start by presenting Wocky's
Chart against her fourth
statement, the one about hiding
dark secrets: she needed to get
that chart from Meraktis and
destroy it! Alita counters by
stating that the doctor is
responsible for the contents of
that chart. The judge asks Alita
to amend her testimony, and as
she does so, Apollo gets a
reaction from his bracelet!
Trucy didn't notice at all. It's
up to us to discover her habit.
Alita will now amend her
testimony:

-Why would I go to the clinic no

Use the bracelet on this
statement. Move your focus to
her ring: when it moves, press
"percieve". Apollo declares that
she had to go "now". Why?
Present Wocky's Check-Up Report:
Wocky had just learned that the
bullet was inside him, and if he
found out that Alita was in on
the conspiracy, she'd be toast.
She shrieks as the background
returns. Both the judge and
Klavier have no idea what's
going on, but they both agree
that Alita has been lying to the
court. But Alita argues that she
only went to warn Meraktis about
Wocky, and then left. Klavier
asks Alita to amend her
testimony:

-Nothing happened at all. I warn

Oh, really? Present the Bullet
against this statement: this was
found in the office's safe.
Kinda hard to claim that nothing
else happened, huh? Apollo asks
that the ballistic markings on
both bullets be checked. After a
while, a report comes in: the
markings on both bullets match.
That means that Alita is the
murderer! Plus, there's the fact
that she asked Wocky to marry
her. Maybe she asked so she
could get her hands on the
family's money! After all, when
Wocky dies after the wedding,
she'd inherit it by default!
That's when Wocky charges the
stand, admitting that he shot
Meraktis, but Alita just laughs,
proving that she doesn't really
like him at all. Well, she may
have admitted that she's greedy,
but she's still denying that
she's a murderer. After all, we
have the chart, not her! She
admits that SHE was the one who
broke into the clinic yesterday!
She heard Apollo and Trucy
outside the office, and made a
run for it. Alita will now
testify further as to the events
that transpired in that office
that night.

ALITA TIALA'S THIRD TESTIMONY:
THE MERAKTIS CLINIC 2
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-Yes, I went to the clinic that 

-I wanted that chart, but I fail
later.

-In any case, I didn't shoot him
pistol, do you?

-And that brat was spotted in th

-Frankly, I don't think it matte
temple or not.

Press her last statement, the
one about Dr. Meraktis being
shot in the temple. Alita
asserts that Stickler remembered
thing wrong. Apollo objects, due
to the fact that Stickler's shoe
imprints were found where he
claims he was. But where else
could the murderer have shot the
victim? Select "Somplace else"
and point to the stand itself:
maybe the murderer was hiding in
there when the murder took
place! Klavier objects, saying
that there's no proof someone
was in that stand! He wants
proof? "Well, I've got it!"
Present the Slippers as proof:
we found a print left by these
near the stand, and Alita wore
these, since her toe print was
found inside! Klavier objects
again, saying there's no room in
that cart for someone to hide!
Present the Bowl as proof to the
contrary: we found tons of these
bowls in the clinic's reception
area. Maybe they were removed
from the stand by a certain
someone! Alita denies all of
this, and the judge gives her
one more chance to explain
herself.

ALITA TIALA'S FINAL TESTIMONY:
TIALA'S EXPLANATION
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night, I went to ask Dr. M

-I had no intention of ever lett
Family's hands.

-But Dr. Meraktis didn't underst

-For some reason, he thought the

-So I gave up and went home... A

Use the bracelet on her last
statement, the one about he
giving up and going home. Move
your focus to the hand that's
next to her neck. When she
starts pulling on her scarf,
press "percieve". Something must
have happened between Alita and
Meraktis! To prove it, present
the Lamp: it's cord has a
pinkish mark on it. Apollo
immediately asks Alita to remove
her scarf. She shrieks,
refusing. The judge officialy
orders her to remove her scarf.
She does so, revealing a mark
around her neck. Meraktis must
have attacked her with the lamp
in an effort to strangle her to
death. Wait.... if Alita was
unconcious after the attack, how
could she have snuck onto the
cart and shot the victim?
NOOOOOOO!!! When Alita is about
to leave, Klavier holds her up.
What did Meraktis do after he
choked Altia to "death"? Present
the Noodle Stand as proof: he
was pulling it when he died.
Maybe he put Alita's "corpse" in
the cart and attempted to
dispose of her "body"! Klavier
objects, saying that the park is
a dead end. Apollo counters with
the possibility of the park
being his destination. Why would
he go to that park? Point to the
river: it's the perfect place to
dispose of a body. He was going
to throw her in the river! When
she woke up, Alita must have
panicked. When Stickler shouted,
she took her chance and shot
Meraktis!

Alita calmly denies it, saying
that Dr. Meraktis owned a car.
It was still running after he
accidentaly hit Phoenix. Why
didn't he use his car instead?
Apollo falters, and that's when
Klavier gives him a piece of
advice: consider all of the
facts, and when you do, you will
find the truth. Answer that "The
car didn't run." To prove it,
present Trucy's Panties: Before
the murder happened, Stickler
shoved them into Meraktis' car's
tailpipe. It wouldn't have run
if they were there! That's why
he stole the stand: there was
nothing else he could have used!
Alita finally admits defeat. She
also confesses that she hired
Apollo in order to get Wocky
declared guilty. What a witch!
In light of the facts, the judge
declares Wocky Not Guilty of
murdering Pal Meraktis.

Back in the lobby, Wocky and
Winfred are at it again. Time to
end this once and for all.
Present Wocky's Chart as proof
of why Winfred's trying to go
legit. He found one of the best
doctors in the world, one that
could remove the bullet, but the
operation is expensive, and
Winfred doesn't want to use the
same money that hurt Wocky in
the first place. Wocky, in
tears, storms out. Winfred is
finally satisfied, and offers
Apollo and Trucy the first
slices of his Kitaki Lime Pie
(Huh. Guess that explains the
apron.). Apollo still doesn't
really understand his power and
sees Trucy as the key to
unlocking it's potential. Plus,
he still wants to know more
about that legendary case, so
he'll be sticking around at the
agency for a bit longer. Save
your game.

Case 3: Turnabout Serenade
[TURNSER]
--------------------------------

:DAY 1 " INVESTIGATION:

It's been a while since Apollo's
first case for the agency, but
this time around, he's attending
a Gavinners concert (The
Gavinners, if you haven't
figured it out by now, is
Klavier's band). He hates the
noise, but Klavier is just too
cool to NOT look at. He was even
nice enough to send the two of
them tickets at 20% off! Apollo
and Trucy head on in to
Klavier's dressing room.

Klavier is just grinning like he
won a big case. The next part
will feature a special guest:
Lamiroir, the "Siren of the
Ballad". Klavier complements her
on her singing, and someone says
that he praises her more than he
needs to. A big guy with an
equally impressive beard steps
up. This is Romein LeTouse,
Lamiroir's manager and
interpreter (if you're asking
yourself why he's named after a
veggie, it's because the
director saw it listed in a
recipe). Lamiroir herself will
appear, robed in a blue garment.
She also brings along her
pianist, 14-year-old Machi
Tobaye. He doesn't go anywhere
without Lamiroir: after all,
he's blind. Lamiroir will be
singing a ballad composed by
Klavier called "The Guitar's
Serenade". They'll all head back
to the stage. Enjoy the video,
but take note of the flaming
guitar and the disappearing
singer.

Backstage, Trucy and Apollo
comment on the performance, also
noting the burning guitar.
They'll head on into the
dressing room.

This is the first time we've
seen Klavier like this!
Apparently, he had no idea that
the guitar was going to be set
on fire! Huh? Wasn't HE the one
that set up this concert? Talk
to him about "The flaming
guitar". Klavier confirms: the
guitar burning wasn't part of
the show. But Trucy points out
that the crowd din't seem to
realize. Looks like he got
lucky. However, the guitar was
priceless, and if he had burned
or broken all of his guitars on
stage, he'd be flat broke in no
time. He also whines a bit about
his bad day: his hog is ghost,
his case is in no shape to carry
anything, and to top it all off,
someone burned a guitar! Next,
talk about "Lamiroir's song".
Klavier worked together with
Lamiroir to create the song: she
provided the melody, and he came
up with the lyrics. Something
that was a bit suprising was
that Lamiroir sang in English.
Klavier has a copy of the
lyrics, and he hands it over to
Apollo. The Lyrics Sheet will be
added to the court record. It's
time for the final act, but
Apollo's staying behind: he
needs to rest his ears. Move to
the "Backstage Hallway".

What is Ema doing here? Did she
come to see the concert too?
Actually, she's in charge of
security for the event (and
being grumpy at the same time no
less...), because Klavier asked
her to. The door next to the one
leading to Klavier's dressing
room leads to Lamiroir's room,
but Ema won't let us in. Examine
the door anyway. As Apollo and
Ema are arguing, they hear a
strange bang! After a little
while, another one goes off! Are
they gunshots!? Ema, concerned
for Lamiroir's safety, barges on
in, and Apollo follows her.

Well, it isn't Lamiroir who's
been shot; it's her manager,
LeTouse! Ema runs off for
backup, leaving Apollo alone
with the weak man. With the last
of his strength, Letouse imparts
the following words to Apollo
(And I quote): "Ask...
wi...witness... ... ...Can't
s...see... The wi...
witness...is...si...si...ren..."
As Apollo hears someone outside
the door, Ema comes back, and
confirms that LeTouse is dead.

With the concert cancelled, all
of the attendees were
interrogated before being let
go, and the venue's been
gridlocked by the police.
Klavier thanks the man giving
the report (a guy named Darian),
and issues a gag order (in
layman's terms, no one involved
with the murder can talk about
the details to anyone else.).
The Investigation Request will
be added to the court record.
Even though we don't have a
client, we won't be going
anywhere else tonight, so we
might as well investigate
further. Move to "Lamiroir's
Dressing Room".

Well, as expected, Ema is here.
First, talk to her about "The
victim". It was LeTouse's first
time in the country, apparently.
She can't think of anyone who'd
want to kill him here. A request
for more information on him has
already been sent. Next, talk
about "The crime". We already
know that the crime took place
during the concert, since we
found the body. But if that's
true, where did the killer go?
They couldn't have escaped
through the window: it's too
small for anyone but a little
kid to get through. Examine the
pendant on the ground. Who
dropped it? Why is it here? The
Brooch will be added to the
court record. Next, examine the
gun. It's a .45 calibur
revolver, which is pretty hefty.
If someone not used to firing a
weapon that size tried to use
it, it'd dislocate their
shoulder! The Revolver will be
added to the court record.
Present the Revolver to Ema. She
senses something off about the
weapon. Talk to her about "The
murder weapon". Not only does
she mention what I said up
above, she also says that using
that gun was overkill: why use a
weapon like that against a big
man in a small room? Next,
examine the holes in the wall.
The revolver was shot twice: one
missed the victim and hit the
wall. The other hit it's target,
passed through him, and impacted
the wall as well. That's one
powerful gun! Now, examine the
body. We'll take a closer look
at it. Examine his hand. Ema,
intitially disallowing the
investigation of the body
(Apollo points out that she'll
run out of snackoos if she keeps
throwing them), opens the hand
to reveal a key ring (heart-
shaped, no less). Could it
belong to the murderer? The Key
Ring will be added to the court
record. At this point, Ema will
leave, asking Apollo and Trucy
to watch over the body. We won't
get anywhere else by just
staying here, so head to "The
stage" via the hallway, but on
the way, you'll run into a
magician wearing yellow
clothing. Who is he?

Klavier is still having a bad
day, and having a murder happen
during one of his concerts
doesn't help brighten his mood.
The other guy has to agree on
that point. Plus, someone messed
up the beat during one of their
songs. The other man tries to
pin the blame on Klavier, but
he's not buying it (insulting
his bandmate in the process).
Klavier finally notices Apollo
and Trucy, and his bandmate
introduces himself as Detective
Daryan Crescend (showing off his
pompador in the process...). He
specializes in international
cases. Why is a detective part
of the band? Trucy seems to have
a better idea of what's going
on. Talk to Klavier about "The
case". Klavier intially has no
idea what crime Apollo's
referring to, but he gets the
gist soon enough (he's had some
problems recently...). He
doesn't want to pry in any
further since the police are the
ones in charge of the
investigation. Next, talk about
"The Gavinners". Everyone in the
band is someway or another
involved in law enforcement.
They became really popular
overnight, and the hits just
kept coming. Daryan then
complains about Kalvier's
perfectionism, while Klavier
keeps on complaining about the
bungled performance. Now talk
about "The missed cue". Trucy
didn't notice anything wrong
when she was listening to the
performance. Daryan continues to
insist that it was no big deal,
but Klavier has other plans. He
brings out a mixing board and
asks Apollo to listen to it.
Klavier will describe how to use
it: the thing on the bottom is a
progress bar: by selecting a
certain section, you can listen
to just that section. Next are
the sliders: They adjust the
volume for each instrument. You
can mute any instrument you
want. Klavier will ask Apollo to
find out who missed their cue
during the performance. Select
the fourth part, and mute all of
the instruments, but leave No. 2
untouched. Take a listen: kinda
sounds wierd, doesn't it? Select
No. 2 and present it. The 2nd
player is Daryan! He messed up
the cue! As Klavier continues to
harp on Daryan, Apollo will add
the info about the Mixing Board
to the court record.

Present the Key Ring to Klavier.
He confirms that it's his, but
when he's told of where they
found it, he's dumbfounded.
Trucy blackmails Klavier into
talking about his bad day, using
his key ring as leverage. Talk
about "Gavin's troubles". It all
started when his key ring was
stolen. Because of that, he had
to call a cab and break open his
guitar case. And in it was the
very guitar that burned up on
stage. Trucy seems to see a
connection with Klavier's
problems today and a piece of
evidence. Klavier seems to get
the idea, but Daryan and Apollo
are clueless. Is there really a
connection? Answer "I have
noticed". Present the Lyrics
Sheet as proof. Everything
that's happened is in the lyrics
to the song! Now talk about "The
song's prediction". Time to take
a look at the lyrics sheet:
"stole away the keys my heart
held onto" refers to the fact
that Klavier's key ring was
stolen. "Burn my love away"
points to the burning guitar,
and "bullet of love ... take my
life away" focuses on the
murder. Either this is really a
prediction, or the murderer is
imitating the lyrics! Daryan
leaves to procure more info
about LeTouse. Klavier also
leaves, wanting nothing more to
do with the mysteries
surrounding the case. Before he
goes, he reveals that Lamiroir
is currently in his dressing
room, so head on over there. On
the way, that yellow magician
pops back up before fleeing.
Trucy has the nagging feeling
that she's seen him before...

Lamiroir (speaking English, no
less!) demands to know what's
going on, but due to the gag
order, we can't tell her. She
reveals that she's not really
from Borginia like Machi is. In
fact, the fact that she can
speak English was kept secret to
market her image as an exotic
singer from overseas, and
LeTouse was in on it, obviously.
Machi requests to leave to get
some fresh air, and Lamiroir
allows it. Talk to her about
"Lamiroir". Lamiroir started
singing in a Borginian
restaurant when she caught a
producer's eye. She became a
celebrity overnight. She also
says that due to her contract,
she can't speak in English in
public. She's known as the
"Landscape Painter in Sound",
because when she sings, it's as
though the you're seeing the
sights she sees when she travels
abroad. She's also known as the
"Siren of the Ballad". In fact,
"Lamiroir" means "the Siren" in
Borginese. Now talk about
"Machi". She first met Machi
while he was playing the piano
in a restaurant. Machi is an
orphan, and he has natural
talent. Lamiroir became his
guardian, and hardly leaves her
side, because he's blind. This
is also his first time out of
Borginia. In fact, he's required
to be with her as part of the
contract. Now talk about "Mr.
LeTouse". LeTouse was actually
her new manager, and signed on
about 3 months ago. He was also
the one who came up with the
"Siren" title. That's when
Apollo makes the connection:
when LeTouse was talking about
the Siren, he meant Lamiroir!
Talk about "The "Siren"". Apollo
asks Lamiroir if she saw
anything, since LeTouse named
her as a witness. Lamiroir
pleads her right to silence,
since Apollo's not a part of the
police department. Next, examine
the postcard on the table. The
letters on the bottom are in
Borginese. According to
Lamiroir, it roughly translates
to "A landscape painter in
sound". The Postcard will be
added to the court record.
Finally, present the Brooch to
Lamiroir. She confirms that it's
hers. But why was it there at
the scene of the crime? Head
back to the hallway.

Ema's back, and she's not happy.
She exclaims that LeTouse's body
has gone missing! We'll move
automatically to Lamiroir's
room.

Klavier's here too, and he's
pretty concerned as well. Still,
the police have the place
surrounded, so the thief
couldn't have gone far. Daryan
comes by and complains that his
guitar has gone missing. OK, so
we have a corpse and a guitar to
find. Head to the stage.

The platform's been elevated,
but why? Examine it. Apollo
(who's afraid of heights it
seems) climbs up onto the
platform. On top is the body,
which is strapped to Daryan's
guitar, but Machi is also there,
unconsious! What's going on
here?

:DAY 2 " INVESTIGATION:

Machi's been arrested for
LeTouse's murder. Why? Klavier
drops by and says that the
"powers that be" want this case
wrapped up quickly, since
Lamiroir came from Borginia as
an ambassador of good will. He
also informs Apollo that Machi
has requested that he be the
defense attorney (Apollo, not
Klavier). Apollo and Trucy head
on down to the Detention Center.

Well, there's only one problem
as far as I can see: Machi can't
speak English, and there's no
interpreter, since Lamiroir is
with Klavier at the moment. We
have no choice but to wait for
the trial to start. Save your
game.

:DAY 3 " TRIAL:

Before the Judge allows Klavier
to give out his opening
statement, he wants his advice:
what do you say to a guy that
has a terminal disease? He
reveals that the Chief Justice,
his friend's, son is ill in the
hospital, and things don't look
good. He wants to wrap this up
early, since he's going to go
visit him. Klavier has good news
for him: he's going to that
hospital visit sooner than
expected. Why? Klavier goes on
to outline the case, and
LeTouse's Autopsy Report will be
added to the court record.
LeTouse didn't die immediately,
but it was inevitable, due to
the blood loss. The Crime Photo
will be added to the court
record. Klavier will also point
out on the diagram where the
bullets hit. The Diagram will be
added to the court record. As
one can see, the dressing room
has only one door, and right
after the murder, Ema and Apollo
busted through the door, and the
killer was nowhere to be found.
Klavier then goes for the final
blow: only one person could have
killed the victim, and that's
Machi. Klavier will call Ema to
the stand to explain the
circumstances of the crime.

EMA SKYE'S FIRST TESTIMONY:
MURDEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-The night of the murder, I was 
Gavin's request.

-Only people invloved with the c
backstage.

-At the beginning of the third s

-I went into the room, filled wi
body.

-I examined the scene and determ
done it.

Start by pressing the first
statement, the one about being
on security. It turns out that
even Ema doesn't know why she
was put there. Klavier explains
that, having had his keys stolen
earlier that day, he wanted some
extra security so that nothing
else wound up missing, and put
Ema up for the job, reason being
because she had a lot of free
time on her hands (that makes
Ema a bit more angry). Press her
next statement, the one about
only involved persons being
allowed backstage. Ema didn't
know that Apollo and Trucy got
in because of Klavier's
influence. Some fans also tried
to get in, but some well-thrown
snackoos kept them out. Press
her next statement, the one
about the shots. Only Ema and
Apollo were there, and those
shots sounded pretty clear.
Press her next statement, the
one about heading into the room.
The speakers funneled the music
from the stage, and Klavier had
them on at full volume. If the
band was playing when the murder
happened, then they all have an
alibi. Press her last statement,
the one about the defendant. Ema
explains that someone used the
air vent to escape from the
scene. Trouble is, only a child
could fit through there, and the
only child involved with the
concert was Machi. Plus, some
marks were found on the air
vent's grill, indicating that it
had been opened recently. And if
that weren't enough, Machi's
fingerprints were clearly found
on that grill!

The judge decides that there's
enough evidence to support a
verdict. Klavier says that
though the prosecution has no
direct witnesses, he's still
provided all the evidence
needed. Do we have anything that
contradicts the evidence? "Call
a witness". As to who, present
Lamiroir's profile: LeTouse,
with his dying breath, named her
as a witness to the murder.
Klavier continues to insist that
there was no witness, but the
judge decides to call Lamiroir
in regardless.

On the stand, Lamiroir reveals
to the court that she can speak
English (we already knew about
that). Klavier also reveals that
she has amnesia (THAT we didn't
know), and asks that the court
be gentle to her (Read: pressing
the wrong statements will net
you a penalty). Lamiroir will
begin her testimony of the
events that night.

LAMIROIR'S FIRST TESTIMONY: WHAT
I SAW
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-As for what I saw... I saw noth

-That night, I was invited to si

-I did not return backstage afte

-Then I was led by the police to
wait there.

-That was where I learned that s
told the details.

Present the Brooch against her
third statement, the one about
not heading backstage after the
second set: we found this at the
crime scene, and since it's
her's, it means that she went
there that night! Lamiroir
claims, through Klavier, that
she only went backstage for a
brief spell of time. She was
going to go in and even saw a
bit of the scene, but when
Apollo yelled out, she became
frightened and headed back to
the stage. That was when she
dropped her brooch. Lamiroir
will now amend her testimony
with two new statements:

-When my performance was finishe

-I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeT

Use the bracelet on the latter
statement, the one about the
body. Move your focus down to
her neck: when she gulps, press
"Percieve". When Lamiroir
recalls the event, she asks him
why LeTouse had to be shot. But
wait... how did Lamiroir know
that LeTouse was shot? Wasn't a
gag order placed on the case
right after the murder? Present
the Investigation Request as
proof of this. After the
background fades back in,
Lamiroir will request to add a
statement to her testimony, and
Klavier allows it:

-I saw bullet holes in the wall,

If Lamiroir saw the scene as she
claims she did, she could not
have seen those bullet holes:
they were on the wall the door
was positioned on! Present the
Diagram against this statement.
The judge asks that Lamiroir
once again testify as to what
she saw that night.

LAMIROIR'S SECOND TESTIMONY:
WHAT I SAW 2
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I was on my way from the stage 

-There was something like a litt

-There were two shots... I could

-But it wasn't Machi!

-It was a grown person! ...I kno

Press her last statement, the
one about the shooter being an
adult. Lamiroir clarifies that
the shooter was a male. She also
heard the person talking, but
she can't remember what they
were saying. She also says that
she never forgets a voice. If
this testimony holds up, then
we've won! However, answer that
"It's contradictory". Why?
Because only a child could get
through that air vent! Klavier,
however, provides another
contradiction: the small window
was closed at the time of the
crime, so there is no way that
Lamiroir could see or hear
anyone! Klavier asks that
Lamiroir be excused from the
stand, and the judge agrees,
allowing Ema to re-take the
stand. There's also the mystery
of why the killer moved the
body, so Ema will testify about
that.

EMA SKYE'S FINAL TESTIMONY: THE
MISSING BODY
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I believe Machi stole the body 

-He moved the body to match Lami

-No one in this country had a mo

-And, Machi practically left his

-All of this evidence clearly po

Press her fourth statement, the
one about Machi's "signature".
The bullet holes prove it: that
room is cramped, and under those
conditions, it would be very
difficult to miss someone...
assuming that they could see:
remember, Machi's blind. What
now? "Raise an onjection." That
gun is very heavy, and if
someone hadn't fired a gun
before, they could easily
dislocate their shoulder!
Unfortunately, Machi's a kid,
and he wouldn't have been all
that familiar with firearms too.
Grrrrr! Klavier will ask Ema to
revise her testimony:

-From the state of the crime sce
blind.

Take a look at the Crime Photo:
there's a bloody smear next to
his hand, but there are remnants
of writing left behind. If Machi
WAS blind, he couldn't have
rubbed them out! Present the
Crime Photo against this
statement, then point to the
smear when asked. That's when
Klavier pounces: he asks Ema why
she thinks Machi is blind. Well,
they are always walking hand-in-
hand, and Lamiroir even leads
him to the piano. Klavier,
however, shows off a report from
Borginia stating that Machi CAN
see! Drat! If Machi can see,
then he could be the shooter!
Ema gets angry again, but she
quickly gets an idea: you can't
get rid of blood THAT easily!
All one has to do is use
luminol! The judge will order
that the smear (which was
already cut out by the police
for further investigation) be
brought into court and tested.
Ema asks that Apollo use the
luminol on the carpet (if you've
played case 1-5, you already
know how to do this...). Spray
on the smear itself. It's some
sort of code, and it reads as
"IPXX-314206". Klavier
immediately knows what it is:
it's a number for Interpol, the
international police. Maybe
Machi is actually an undercover
agent? But why would LeTouse
know a number like that? Klavier
calls Daryan up and asks him to
look into the number further.

In the meantime, the court
ponders the reason as to why
Machi would pretend that he's
blind. Klavier asks Apollo to
present some evidence. He also
states that he wasn't doing it
for himself. If that's true,
then maybe Lamiroir is the blind
musician, not Machi! Choose to
"Show evidence", then present
the Postcard. Klavier asks that
Lamiroir be brought back in.
When she arrives, she confirms
that she's blind: that's why
Klavier said that there was no
direct witness. Klavier will ask
Lamiroir to testify about her
condition.

LAMIROIR'S THIRD TESTIMONY:
LAMIROIR'S EYES
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I have no memory of the "light"

-I debuted in a world of darknes

-My producer came up with my PR 

-So, silly as it may sound, I ha

-Everyone on my staff knew, of c

Press her last statement, the
one about everyone on her staff
knowing about her condition. She
explains that because LeTouse
was her manager, he knew as
well. But that doesn't make any
sense! Why would LeTouse name
her as the witness if she
couldn't see? Klavier offers up
an explanation: when LeTouse
said "can't see", he was
refering to Lamiroir's blindess.
Lamiroir, however, claims that
she still heard the shots and
the voice, despite the fact that
the window was closed. If she
heard that voice again, she'd
know it in an instant. That's
when the baliff interrupts the
proceedings with Daryan's
findings. Klavier requests that
Daryan takes the stand to
report, and the judge allows it.
When he gets on the stand, he
states that the Interpol number
belongs to quite the individual:
Romein LeTouse himself! He also
informs the court that the
murder weapon belonged to
LeTouse himself. But why would
LeTouse, an Interpol agent, be
involved with Lamiroir? As
Daryan prepares to leave,
Lamiroir charges the stand. She
declares that the voice she
heard belongs to Daryan! This is
insane! A detective... being
accused of murder!? What a ride!
Save your game.

:DAY 3 " INVESTIGATION:

Back at the agency, Apollo and
Trucy ponder Lamiroir's
accusation against Daryan.
Apollo, however, has bigger
concerns, wondering what Phoenix
has been up to lately. Trucy
says that he's on a top-secret
mission, but it probably has
nothing to do with the case.
Talk with her about "Daryan did
it". Apollo asks if Trucy saw
Daryan during the third set and
she confirms, but she immedately
realizes what that means: he has
an alibi, and thus, could not be
the shooter. Either Lamiroir is
mistaken, or she's lying. Next,
talk about "Agent LeTouse".
Apollo raises the possibility
that LeTouse was investigating
Lamiroir, but Trucy doesn't buy
that. All we know is that he was
investigating something or
someone, and it's most likely
related to our case. Before we
can head out, that yellow
magician pops back in, twirling
his staff! Trucy finally
recognizes him: he's the famous
magician Valant Gramarye! Valant
hasn't seen Trucy in about seven
years, and that was back when he
worked with his partner, and
Trucy calls him "daddy". Huh? I
thought Phoenix was her father!
Talk to Valant about "Troupe
Gramarye". Valant is one of the
more famous members of Troupe
Gramarye, a group of great and
talented magicians. In fact, his
partner was part of the troupe
as well. His partner's name was
Zak Gramarye. Now talk about
"Trucy's father". Trucy
confirms: Zak Gramarye is her
biological father (in other
words, Phoenix is her adoptive
father). He disappeared about
seven years ago. Trucy, however,
doesn't feel lonely: she's got
Phoenix and Apollo, after all.
Valant, however had a reason for
coming in, aside from seeing
Trucy again: a recorded video of
Lamiroir's performance. Watch it
again (you don't have a choice
here...). It's obvious that
Valant was at the concert that
night, but why? The Video Tape
will be added to the court
record. Finally, present the
video tape to Valant. He
confirms that he was hired to
help with the whole
"disappearing singer" act.
However, he won't tell Apollo
how he did it (a magician's
number one rule: never reveal
the secrets of your art!), and
decides to head on down to the
Colisseum to take a look around
himself, and leaves, not with a
poof, but the closing of a door.
Head to the detention center:
it's time to talk to Machi...
or, at least, try to.

Well, one thing's for certain:
Machi lied to us about seeing.
Let's see what we can get from
him. Try to talk to him about
"The trial today". Machi doesn't
say anything, since he can't
speak English, but Apollo feels
something from his bracelet...
Next, try to talk about
"Lamiroir's testimony". Again,
Apollo's bracelet is reacting to
Machi. What else could Machi be
lying about? We'll have to talk
to him later, since we need to
do a bit more investigation.
Head to the Backstage Hallway,
first, through the agency, then
through "Sunshine Colliseum".

Well, well, if it isn't
Lamiroir! She may not have seen
the crime, being that she's
blind, but she managed to hear
it (in fact, she knew that
Apollo and Trucy were coming
thanks to their footsteps). Talk
to her about "The voice". As she
said earlier today, she heard
Daryan's voice on her way from
the stage to the backstage area.
After that, shots rang out. At
the time, she thought that she
had imagined those shots and
never told security about them.
That, and she was in a rush, so
she didn't have time to linger.
Next, talk about "Machi". As we
already know, she met Machi
while singing in Borginia, but
this was before she became
Lamiroir. When Machi learned
that she couldn't see, he helped
her, but he only pretended to be
blind after Lamiroir signed the
contract. The whole "holding
hands" thing not only served to
further the image that Lamiroir
could see, it was also a means
of communication: Machi would
write in her hand things that
she needed to know after they
separated. Next, talk about "Mr.
LeTouse". Lamiroir comes to the
same conclusion that Apollo did:
that he was investigating her.
Remember, Lamiroir has amnesia.
Maybe he was investigating her
past! Finally, talk about the
""Darkness"". Lamiroir first
awoke in darkness, blind. But it
is not this darkness that she
fears: it is the possible
darkness in her heart, lingering
from her past. Trucy says that
she could never harm a person,
and Lamiroir thanks her: Machi
keeps saying things along this
line whenever she brings up her
past. Present the Video Tape to
Lamiroir. Lamiroir was in on the
illusion too it seems, but the
professional magician (Valant)
swore her to secrecy on this
matter. After these five things
are done, Lamiroir will want to
talk to Apollo about something.
When she was walking though the
hallway, she tripped on
something: most likely, the
thing on the floor. Trucy will
pick it up and hand it to
Lamiroir. She informs the duo
that it's a headset, and
everyone performing and on staff
wore one of these the night of
the murder. The Headset will be
added to the court record.
Present the Headset: Lamiroir
explains that the headset has a
limited range. It's only
operational within 30 feet or
so. If they tried to use
something stronger, they'd
interfere with the sound
systems. Head to the stage.

Someone's playing the piano, and
that someone turns out to be
Valant! He was here examining
the stage, insuring that the
illusion took place without a
hitch. That's when he saw the
piano, and started playing. Talk
to him about "Lamiroir's
illusion". The one who hired him
to do the illusion was Klavier.
He was told to make her
disappear, "like a dream". He
did what he could with the
materials available to him, and
what he did was fantastic! But
in order to get across the
stage, she'd need to use some
sort of secret passage. That's
why Klavier called upon Valant:
his illusions are tailored to
the needed specifications.
Valant declares that the
illusion indeed went well: not a
bad thing, especially
considering that he's part of
Troupe Gramarye. While he was
playing the piano, though, he
noticed something a bit off. Now
talk about "Troupe Gramarye". It
all started with one man, a
genius among his time. His name
was Magnifi Gramarye. However,
about seven years ago, Magnifi
died, and the troupe vanished
from the face of the Earth.
That's when Valant started
taking any job he could get,
like at supermarkets. He keeps
his sense of magic sharp at
these cheap jobs, until the day
the Troupe returns to
prominence. But he's not doing
this for himself: he's doing it
for his partner, Zak. Now talk
about "Valant and Zak". Hundreds
of people flocked to learn from
Magnifi, but among the throes,
only two had the sort of talent
that he was looking for. Those
two were, of course, Zak and
Valant. After they were taken
in, Zak and Valant outshone
their mentor in popularity. And
now that Zak is gone, Valant is
the Troupe's only hope of
returning to the big time.
Examine the piano. When Trucy
tries to play it, one of the
notes won't sound off. She'll
take a closer look, and takes
out something that was stuck in
there: a sort of switch- like
device. The Switch will be added
to the court record. Head back
to Lamiroir's room.

Oh boy. Ema's not in a good mood
today, and we know the reason
why: that glimmerous fop. Plus
her boss gave her a talking-to
regarding Machi's sight. But she
did help us find out that
LeTouse was an Interpol agent,
and that's actually important
information. Talk to Ema about
"The trial today". She had her
fill of embarassement today,
that's certain. But the fact of
the matter is that Machi can
see, and he could have wiped
away the bloody writing.
Lamiroir, however, is still
insisting that she heard
Daryan's voice at the time of
the crime. Next, talk about "The
case". It's certainly possible
that the murderer followed
Klavier's lyrics after a
fashion. This whole mess can't
be a coincidence. Now talk about
"Something strange". While
investigating today, she found
something really small: some
sort of device. It has an
antenna on it, meaning that it's
controlled wirelessly. Are you
thinking what I'm thinking? If
you are (and even if you're
not), present the Switch. Apollo
presses the button and... YEOW!
The device Ema found has started
on fire! Ema, briefly startled,
deduces that this device is an
igniter, and the switch we found
activates it. Talk to Ema about
"The switch". Ema takes a closer
look at it and guesses that the
signal it emits is pretty weak:
it probably won't work beyond 30
feet or so. The Switch is
updated in the court record, and
it's been renamed as the Remote
Trigger. Ema will also draw a
circle on the diagram,
indicating the range at which it
works. The Forum Diagram will be
added to the court record. It's
time to do some more
investigation. Before we leave,
the Igniter will be added to the
court record. Head to the
outside of the Coliseum.

Daryan's out here, having been
exorcised from the
investigation. He blames Klavier
for his sorry state of affairs,
saying that he has an alibi, and
everyone who attended the
concert can attest to that. Talk
to him about "Your alibi". He
reiterates that the shooting
happened while he was on stage,
and thus couldn't be the
murderer. Plus, he never even
met Lamiroir, so how could she
identify him as a killer? Next,
talk to him about "Prosecutor
Gavin". He complains that
Klavier is a perfectionist: if
something even slightly wrong
occurs, he's as angry as a
bucking bull. He states that
Klavier is probably in his
office and gives the two
directions. Then he leaves like
the jerk he is. Don't follow
him: instead, head to "Gavin's
office".

Looks like Klavier's talking to
someone on the phone. He wants
to know what the sample he
recieved is supposed to be. He
also casually reveals that
LeTouse was carrying it in his
suitcase. He'll hang up when
he's done talking, and finally
notices Apollo and Trucy
standing there. Talk to Klavier
about "The case". Ever since he
got back from court, his phone
has been ringing nonstop, and
the reporters are often on the
other side of the line, asking
him what it feels like to kill a
man using a song. He also says
that the murder is being covered
in Borginia as well, but they
don't mention the lyrics (they
think it's a theory, not solid
fact). The Borginian Newspaper
will be added to the court
record. Daryan's off the case
since Lamiroir's testimony will
be in Borginia's evening
newspaper. He's not happy about
it, since Daryan's international
contacts could have been useful.
Next, talk about "The Guitar's
Serenade". Klavier and Lamiroir
first began writing the song
about a year ago, when Klavier
visited Borginia. As they wrote
the song in Lamiroir's room,
Klavier mentioned how he loved
playing her guitar, and she let
him keep it. That same guitar is
now all burnt-out. Examine the
wrecked guitar. Klavier had it
examined earlier and the
examiner found something
intriguing. Next, examine that
white thing. It's the thing that
Klavier was talking about on the
phone. He says that it's a
replica of something, and the
real thing was obviously
LeTouse's target. Talk to him
about "Lamiroir's guitar". He
didn't want to use an airplane
to ship the guitar back home (he
wanted it kept as dry as
possible), so he used a service
normally used for evidence, and
thus, it came to him pristine
and untouched. And now it's
ruined. Prosecutor Gavin's
Guitar will be added to the
court record. The intriguing
part about this guitar was that
the examiner found the remains
of some sort of device. It
certainly looks familiar,
doesn't it? Next, talk about
"The strange lump". Klavier has
no idea what it's a replica of,
and Interpol seems to be
blocking relevatory information
about it. But since Lamiroir is
from Borginia, she might have a
better idea of what it is, hence
why he's calling her in. The
Replica will be added to the
court record. Finally, present
the Igniter. Klavier notices
that the remains of the strange
device and the igniter are the
same. And that's everything that
Klavier's willing to talk about,
but he thanks Apollo for sharing
vital information with him,
noting that no other defense
attorney has done so. Apollo
thinks it's only fair seeing
that Klavier's shared plenty of
info with us too. He explains
that he tries to stay simple on
the inside, since murders are
already complicated enough. All
he wants to do is to find the
truth. Head to the Coliseum.

Ema's out here, looking for
Lamiroir. She's nowhere to be
found! She asks Apollo and Trucy
to help look for her. Head to
the stage.

The lights are out. Now we know
what it's like to be blind. But
something has changed here.
Examine the case on the floor.
Apollo opens it up, and inside
is Lamioir, unconcious! Apollo
immediately heads off to get
Ema, and Lamiroir is rushed to
the Hickfield Clinic in critical
condition.

After a while, Ema comes out,
saying that Lamiroir will be
just fine. Any longer, and she
would have died! Ema reveals
that someone attacked Lamiroir,
and they were intent on killing
her. But why? Lamiroir comes
out, thanking Apollo for saving
her. Talk to her about being
"Attacked!" She says that she
doesn't know who attacked her.
Lamiroir ran for the stage after
she was hit, and turned out the
lights: although the killer
couldn't see her, she's blind,
and had no trouble getting
around. She immediately hid
herself in the case after she
turned off the lights, but fell
unconcious immediately
afterwards. Now talk about "The
assailant". Due to the fact that
she was hit in the head, it must
have been someone who was taller
than she is. Could Daryan have
attacked her? Lamiroir doesn't
even know why she was attacked,
but if Daryan attacked her, then
it's because she named him as
the murderer. Present the
Replica to Lamiroir. She states
that it's a replica of an item
known as a Borginian Cocoon.
Never heard of it. Talk to her
about "The Borginian Cocoon".
She doesn't know what the cocoon
is used for, but what she does
know is that taking a cocoon out
of the country is forbidden. If
someone tries to smuggle one
out, and gets caught, then the
punishment is death. That's
crazy! Lamiroir doesn't know why
the penalty is so severe, but
now we know what LeTouse was up
to: he was searching for a
smuggler! Now talk about
"Smuggling". LeTouse most likely
became her manager because he
thought she was involved in
smuggling one out of the
country: she is known to travel
a lot, after all. If Interpol is
involved, then that means that
there's something suspicious
about the cocoon. Something that
other countries are seriously
scared about. Apollo asks
Lamiroir to come with him to the
detention center: it's time to
drag the truth out of Machi.

There must be something that
Machi isn't telling us. Lamiroir
is immedately concerned, asking
what this secret is. Present the
Replica: maybe Machi was the one
who smuggled the cocoon out of
Borginia! Apollo asks that
Lamiroir interpret for Machi.
Through her, he asks Apollo not
to jump to conclusions. He asks
if Apollo knows everything about
the case. Well, we will soon
enough. Talk to him about "The
cocoon". Machi explains that the
cocoon is the only cure for the
dreaded Incuritis Syndrome. But
if it's a cure, then why not
share the cocoons? The Replica
will be updated in the court
record. Apollo asks Machi if he
stole the cocoon, but he won't
say. But he does say that he
can't go back to Borginia:
remember, cocoon smuggling is
punishable by death in Borginia.
Machi will want to talk about
the case, but Daryan cuts him
off. He's got a meeting with the
embassy, and nothing, not even a
visit, can stop it. Before he
leaves, he admits that he's
never liked Apollo nor Trucy.
Why did Daryan cut us off? There
can only be one reason: he IS
the murderer! For Machi's sake,
we'll have to take him down in
court. Save your game.

:DAY 4 " TRIAL, PART 1:

In the lobby, Valant drops in,
warning Apollo that his illusion
is the key to unraveling the
murder. He doesn't stay longer
to clarify, as he'll be skipping
town. As Apollo is about to step
in, the bailiff stops him: the
judge has requested that the
starting time be postponed.
He'll also give out a newspaper
clipping explaining everything.
The Newspaper Article will be
added to the court record. The
headline mentions Incuritis.
Must be what the Chief Justice's
son has, but why does it sound
so familiar?

Court finally begins, and the
judge apologizes for the
inconvenience. He's sorry to see
his friend go through such pain.
But now is not the time to
linger on the future passing of
a life. Now is the time for law
and order. Klavier gives out his
opening statement, saying that
Daryan has an alibi, and thus
could not be the murderer. The
judge is about to give out the
verdict when Apollo objects:
there's another person that can
be called to the stand, and we
haven't heard from them since
they can't speak English. Apollo
calls Machi up to the stand with
Lamiroir as his interpreter.
Apollo has no idea what he wants
Machi to testify about, as he
has no idea what Machi was going
to say before Daryan cut us off
yesterday. That's when Lamiroir
interrupts, saying that Machi
can prove his innocence. The
judge asks that Machi testify as
to his proof.

MACHI TOBAYE'S TESTIMONY
(THROUGH LAMIROIR): PROOF OF
INNOCENCE
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-He says that word of Mr. LeTous

-But if the killing truly follow

-...I, that is, he, could not ha

-He says that because the lyrics
them.

Lamiroir admits that, though she
explained to him what the song
was about, she never told him
what the exact lyrics were.
Maybe the bracelet can help us
out on this one! Use the
bracelet on the last statement,
the one about the English
lyrics. When Machi looks to the
right (he's looking at
Lamiroir), press Percieve.
Apollo deduces that Machi can,
in fact, understand English. He
claims, through Lamiroir, that
he only understands the word
'English', the name for the
language. Plus, he read all
about the lyrics in the
Borginian Bugle. Prove him wrong
by presenting the Borginian
Newspaper: as Klavier told us,
they never mentioned the lyrics.
Machi screams in Borginian as
the background fades back in.
Lamiroir provides an alternate
explanation, suggesting that the
police mentioned the lyrics
during their questioning.
Klavier counters, saying that
the police never mentioned them
either. That means that the only
way Machi could know about the
lyrics was if he was listening
to the testimony being given in
court, and the only way he could
listen to the testimony was if
he could understand English!
Machi then claims, again through
Lamiroir, that it was SHE that
told him about the lyrics!
Lamiroir confirms, saying that
it had slipped her mind as well.
The judge asks Machi to revise
his testimony, and as the duo
does so, Apollo gets another
reaction from his bracelet!
Maybe there's another lie hidden
in the testimony! Machi and
Lamiroir will amend their
testimony:

-It was I who explained that the

Use the bracelet on this
statement, and quickly move your
focus to Lamiroir. When she
swallows, press Percieve. Why is
she uncertain all of a sudden?
Could she be protecting someone?
Present Machi's profile as proof
of this: he's like a son to her,
and she'd do anything to help
him, even lie under oath! Apollo
asks that Machi talk without
Lamiroir's assistance. He
screams again, this time, in
English, as the background fades
in. Machi admits that he can
speak English, but only a
little. Machi, alone on the
stand, insists that he never
shot anyone. But he can't admit
that he wasn't in the room when
the shots were fired. In fact,
he WAS in that room! He saw
LeTouse on the floor, bleeding.
When he heard Apollo and Ema
talking, he climbed up the
ladder and left the scene of the
crime. Apollo asks that Machi
tell the whole truth, but Machi
absolutely refuses to testify.
Since the defense and defendant
aren't seeing eye to eye, the
judge calls a recess.

Back in the lobby, Machi
continues to insist that he did
not shoot LeTouse. When he came
in, LeTouse was already on the
ground. Then, he heard two shots
and left through the air vent
before Ema and Apollo barged
in... wait. He heard shots AFTER
he found the body!? That's
crazy. In any case, Machi
refuses to testify about the
cocoon. If that's the case, then
we can't force it on him. We'll
have to get someone else to
testify.

Back in court, Apollo informs
the judge that the defendant
will not testify, and instead
wishes to call Lamiroir back to
the stand. Klavier objects,
saying that her testimony is a
travesty. Apollo counters by
dropping a bomb on him: the
attack on Lamiroir. He comes to
the conclusion that someone
wanted her dead because of her
testimony. Apollo once again
asks that Lamiroir be called to
the stand, and the judge
accepts. Apollo reviews her
testimony, but Klavier is
insistent that she could not
have heard Daryan's voice
through the window. The judge
asks that Lamiroir testify once
more.

LAMIROIR'S FOURTH TESTIMONY:
WHAT I HEARD
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I was on my way from the stage 

-That's when I heard them: Mr. L

-I heard the faint sound of a gu
gunshot.

-There was the smell of gunpowde

-I was in a hurry, so I kept mov

Press her second statement, the
one about Mr. LeTouse and
Daryan. Klavier continues to
insist that she couldn't have
heard Daryan through that
window. Time to try a different
angle. Ask her "What were they
talking about?" She didn't hear
everything, but looking back,
she only heard one thing, and
that was Daryan saying, "It's
over. Press the switch! Now!"
Apollo stutters, requesting that
what she heard be added to the
testimony:

-From the small window, I heard 

Maybe the switch that she's
talking about refers to the
remote for those igniters!
Present the Remote Trigger
against this statement. Maybe
the murderer was ordering
someone to use it on stage! But
what for? And how would they get
the message out? Present the
Headset: it works within a
30-ft. radius, the same range
that the trigger uses! Klavier
objects, saying that there was
no way to know where that switch
was at the time of the murder!
Remember what this switch was
used for that night. It was used
to set Klavier's guitar on fire!
If that's true, then the murder
happened during the second set,
not the third! That means that
Daryan could have killed
LeTouse! Present the Igniter to
prove the link between the two
devices. Now we've linked the
murder and the burning guitar!
Klavier objects, saying that
this flies in the face of the
lyrics: LeTouse was supposed to
be shot after the guitar caught
fire! Apollo counters with the
possibility that the murderer
followed the lyrics only to
derail the investigation!
Klavier objects, saying that
Lamiroir could not have heard
Daryan through that window! How
did Lamiroir hear Daryan? Answer
that "She was somewhere else".
When asked where she was, point
to the air vent: she wasn't on
the floor at all! She was in the
air duct, above the ceiling!
Lamiroir confirms: when she
heard it all, she was in the air
vent. The judge asks that
Lamiroir testify as to why she
was up there.

LAMIROIR'S FIFTH TESTIMONY:
ABOVE THE CEILING
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-Yes, I was above the ceiling wh

-I had heard that there was a, e

-It was in the middle of my perf
I had heard.

-As to why I was there... I cann

-I am bound to secrecy on this m

Why was she up there in the
first place? Maybe it has
something to do with the
illusion that Valant had
planned! Present the Video Tape
against her fourth statement,
the one where she can't say why
she was up there. Apollo
explains that Lamiroir was in
the air vent, heading to her
assigned location in order to
complete the illusion. Lamiroir
confirms, but the judge isn't
convinced: he points out that
Lamiroir vanishes for about
twenty seconds, which isn't
enough time to head to that
location through the air vent!
The judge asks that Lamiroir
testify to the best of her
ability.

LAMIROIR'S FINAL TESTIMONY: THE
BIG ILLUSION
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I followed the route exactly as

-There is an emergency exit in t

-From there, one can enter the f
stage.

-The plan was for me to move the

-I was on my way, when I heard t

Press her fourth statement, the
one about getting there in two
minutes. She could have done it
in one minute if she had ran.
She almost missed her cue. She
stopped about halfway, and
that's because she heard Daryan.
Is there any evidence that
proves she made the trip in two
minutes? Take a look at the
video: before Lamiroir
disappears, she's still wearing
her brooch, but when she
reappears, she's not wearing it!
There's only one explanation:
the Lamiroir on stage was a
double, meant to fool the crowd
while the real Lamiroir made her
way through the air vent! Choose
to "Present evidence", then
present the pendant. Klavier
confirms, saying that Valant
posed as Lamiroir that night.
But one thing's still off: the
music doesn't stop, and Valant
sounds just like Lamiroir. Trucy
suggests that they used a
recording, but Klavier scoffs at
this, saying that when the
Gavinners play, they don't use
recordings: it's all live. The
judge asks that Lamiroir amend
her testimony:

-I... had to keep singing, even 

Press this statement. Lamiroir
reveals that she was singing
while she made her way through
the air vent, using her headset.
LeTouse and the murderer would
have thought that Lamiroir was
already on stage, and didn't
notice her singing above their
heads! She also admits that when
she heard the shots, she stopped
singing briefly. She was
supposed to sing "Pleasure,
pleasure", but only one
"Pleasure" is heard! This means
that no one on stage during the
second set could be the
murderer! Klavier, however,
points out that Apollo's case is
all based upon Lamiroir's
testimony, and if she's lying,
then the case is kaput. But he
DOES know that he has no choice
but to call Daryan to the stand,
not as a detective, but as a
suspect in the murder of Romein
LeTouse. The judge allows it and
calls a recess while Daryan is
brought in. It's time to tackle
the murderer himself! Save your
game.

:DAY 4 " TRIAL, PART 2:

Phoenix drops on by, and he
knows what's going on. He only
came by for a little while, but
he gives Apollo something from
Ema: the remains of some
firecrackers. She found these in
Lamiroir's dressing room today,
but why would someone set off
firecrackers there? The Burnt
Fragments will be added to the
court record. Phoenix also tells
Apollo to find Daryan's
"igniter": it'll be difficult to
find him guilty under the
current legal system, so
conventional methods are out.
That means he'll be cool and
collected, which means no
nervous twitches. Phoenix heads
back out, just when it's time to
go back in. But what did Phoenix
mean by finding Daryan's
"igniter"?

Court's back in session, and
Klavier takes the time to state
that he believes Daryan is
innocent: after all, he's the
first detective he's ever worked
with, and they're bandmates. But
regardless, Klavier calls Daryan
to the stand. Daryan has no clue
how it came to this, since
Klavier gave him his word that
he wouldn't be standing here.
The judge will give Daryan a
chance to respond to Lamiroir's
testimony, and he'll take that
chance.

DARYAN CRESCEND'S FIRST
TESTIMONY: DARYAN'S REBUTTAL
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-The diva's lying, plain and sim
story.

-In the first place, she never h

-She "forgot the words because s

-Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear 
anyway?

-The shooting took place when I 

Wow. He's sharp to have realized
that Lamiroir is our weak link.
Time to approach this from a
different angle. Remember where
those firecracker remains were
found: they were found in
Lamiroir's room, where that
igniter was found as well! Maybe
the gunshots we heard were fake,
and it was thanks to those
firecrackers! Present the Burnt
Remains against Daryan's fourth
statement, the one about the
gunshots during the third set.
Klavier knows all about the
firecrackers, since Ema came to
him first. That's when Klavier
decided to register Daryan as a
witness in the trial. Daryan
laughs, saying that there was no
way to know when someone would
come by! That's when Klavier
produces the headset found in
the hallway: it was right there
before the third set started.
Daryan probably planted it there
just in case someone came by,
and it just so happens that they
did! Daryan can't believe that
he's been betrayed, but Klavier
says that friendships don't
matter in a court of law. That's
when he turns his attention to
Apollo: we may have proved that
Daryan fabricated an alibi, but
we still don't have proof that
the murder happened during the
third set! Daryan will now
revise his testimony:

-The shooting took place during 
see your proof!

Remember how we found out that
Daryan missed his cue? That's
right, the mixing board! If we
use it for the second set
instead of the third, then we
might hear the gunshot too!
Present the Mixing Board against
this statement, and when asked,
mute all the sounds except for
No. 1: it's got Lamiroir's
vocals on it. At the end of the
first verse, you'll hear a
gunshot. Select No. 1 and
present it. Klavier has no
choice but to say that Lamiroir
was testifying truthfully, and
the murder happened during the
second set, not the third! Plus,
there's the fact that Daryan was
handling a .45 calibur revolver,
which would have dislocated his
shoulder and affected his
playing! Daryan counters, saying
that he's an officer, and he
couldn't have dislocated his
shoulder, due to the fact that
he's had plenty of firearms
training. Klavier cross-
counters, saying that officers
are only given .38 calibur
weapons, so Daryan would have
had no experience with a larger
calibur weapon! Plus, the pistol
belonged to LeTouse, so when
Daryan stole the pistol, he was
holding it the wrong way! Daryan
then counters that he had no
reason to shoot Lamiroir's
manager at all! The judge allows
Daryan to testify again.

DARYAN CRESCEND'S SECOND
TESTIMONY: PROOF OF INNOCENCE
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-C'mon! Why would I even want to

-You want a reason? Easy. I got 

-This was that diva's first trip

-How could I possibly know her m

-If I didn't know him, why would

Remember what LeTouse was
looking for: a smuggled
Borginian Cocoon. Maybe Daryan
was somehow behind it's theft!
Present the Replica against his
last statement, the one where he
asks why he would have killed
LeTouse. These cocoons are a
potent cure, and Daryan, with
his international contacts,
would have known about them!
Plus, if LeTouse had found out
that Daryan was behind it all,
the jig would've been up. That's
why he had to kill him, not as a
manager, but as an Interpol
agent! Klavier provides the
reason as to why it's against
the law to take a cocoon out of
the country: not only can it
create a cure, it can also be
used to make a deadly poison.
Daryan says that he couldn't
find a buyer for it on the black
market: selling it would cause
quite a stir and get him busted.
Daryan will now testify about
the cocoon's banning.

DARYAN CRESCEND'S FINAL
TESTIMONY: COCOON SMUGGLING
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-International Affairs got a mem

-Interpol's all hot and bothered

-Can't sell 'em on the black mar

-Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't ex

-Man, I'm in International Affai

Oh, really? Isn't the Chief
Justice's son sick with
Incuritis? And isn't that what
the cocoon cures? If Daryan sold
one to the Chief Justice, it
would save his son's life, not
to mention shift the heat from
Daryan to another officer of the
law! Present the Newspaper
Article against his third
statement, the one about it
being too dangerous to sell a
cocoon on the black market.
Daryan counters, saying that
there's no proof that he cut a
deal with the Chief Justice!
Plus, there's also Borginian
Customs officers to worry about.
They're on duty 24/7, ensuring
that no cocoon gets out of the
country. Daryan will now revise
his testimony:

-Borginian Customs is very thoro
checked.

-Cocoon possession will get you 
to death.

-Hey, man, if there's a way to g
to know.

Remember what Klavier told us
about his guitar yesterday: he
had it shipped to him using a
special service, and it never
went through customs. Maybe
Daryan used the guitar to
smuggle the cocoon out! Present
Prosecutor Gavin's Guitar
against either the new third
statement or the new last
statement. This is also the
reason why Daryan had the guitar
set on fire: to destroy the
cocoon should he be found out!
Again, Daryan laughs, saying
that he's never been to
Borginia! How could he have used
that guitar in the first place?
Apollo declares that Daryan had
an accomplice from within the
country itself. Who here is from
Borginia? Lamiroir and Machi.
Lamiroir is blind, and she had
no idea who Daryan was before
the trial. That leaves Machi. He
could have talked with Daryan
and helped him smuggle the
cocoon out! Present Machi's
profile when prompted. Plus,
Klavier's guitar was twenty feet
in the air from stage level at
the time, and the device
wouldn't have triggered from
Lamiroir's position when she
heard Daryan! Daryan points out
that Machi couldn't have used
the switch, because he was
playing the piano at the time.
And you need to use two hands to
do so! Can we prove that he
pressed that switch? Answer "I
can prove it." Now present the
mixing board: maybe there was a
phrase that Machi could have
played single handedly. Klavier
concurrs, but Daryan's doubtful.
All we have to do is prove that
the phrase sounded odd in
comparison with the rest of the
song. Mute all of the
instruments, but this time,
leave No. 4 untouched. Take a
listen through the first two
sections of the song: part 1
sounds more graceful than part
2, doesn't it? Select part 1 of
the track and present it. The
judge thinks that everything's
been wrapped up, but Daryan has
other plans. There's no decisive
proof that he's done any of
this! Looks like Phoenix was
right about dealing with him!
But wait! What else did Phoenix
say? He told us to find Daryan's
"igniter"! Well, maybe he's
referring to a big 'ol outburst!
Apollo says there's one thing
that can prove Daryan's guilt.
Think about it: Daryan's said
there's no proof, but in the
abscence of decisive evidence,
we have decisive witnesses!
Choose to "Call a witness", then
present Machi's profile: Machi
knows more about this crime than
anything else, and he can
confirm our theories! Again,
Daryan laughs, saying that Machi
can't admit to smuggling, since
it'd mean his death! But that's
the beauty of it: if Machi
admits to smuggling, under US
law, he'd receive a maximum
sentence of life in prison, but
he'd still be alive! If he were
accused of murder, Borginia
would eventually expedite him
back and kill him! If he doesn't
confess here, he's dead meat!
Daryan goes berzerk, ordering
Machi to stay silent! While the
rest of the court takes this as
a confession, Daryan's still
denying everything. Kind of
pathetic, really.

Machi takes the stand and
confesses to smuggling. He
needed the money, so he assisted
Daryan with his scheme. The
judge promises that he'll be put
on trial later for his crime,
and Machi, taking his sunglasses
off, thanks him. With everything
wrapped up, the judge declares
Machi Not Guilty of murdering
Romein LeTouse.

Back in the lobby, Lamiroir is
disappointed, knowing now that
Machi did smuggle a cocoon, but
he did the right thing by
admitting that he did it.
Phoenix drops back in, with the
information that Lamiroir will
be getting an operation to
repair the damage done to her
eyes: it was due to some tragic
accident that she lost both her
memory and her sight. She never
went through with the surgery
because she was afraid of what
she would discover about herself
if she could see. But thanks to
Apollo's work in court, she's
discovered the courage to go
through with it. Phoenix,
meanwhile, now knows that if his
"secret mission" is to ever see
the light of day, he'll have to
hurry it up... what is he
talking about? Anyways, due to
the trial, "The Guitar's
Serenade" became a smash hit,
and no one is more happy about
it than Klavier is. But the next
time he writes a song, he had
better catch the killer at the
end! Save your game.

Case 4: Turnabout Successor
[TURNSUCCESS]
--------------------------------

:DAY 1 " INVESTIGATION:

It's been 3 months since Machi's
trial, and Apollo has had no new
cases since then. Trucy,
however, is going nuts over the
fact that Valant is going to do
a magic show, which irritates
Apollo to no end. The magic show
will begin in three days, right
at the Colisseum, where the
concert took place. Trucy's even
got the tickets to the show for
herself, Apollo, and Phoenix.
The Magic Show Ticket will be
added to the court record.
Phoenix decides to drop in, and
he's got some important
information. The info has to do
with this secret mission he's
been on, and Apollo's
surprisingly involved. It's all
about the Jurist System...
whatever that is. Talk to
Phoenix about "The Jurist
System". Before the current
court system arose, there were
12-man juries which decided
someone's guilt or innocence.
Under the current proposal, the
count for the jury is halfed:
there will only be six jurors,
and they'll be working with the
judge to decide the verdict.
Next, talk about "The secret
mission". It turns out that all
this time, Phoenix has been
working on getting the Jurist
System up and running. They've
decided to select a sample case
and try the system out, and
Phoenix is in charge of the
selection: after all, he's the
head of the Jurist System
Simulated Court Committee. For
the first case, Phoenix choose a
murder (which, despite what he
says, is NOT as simple as it
seems...), and he also informs
Apollo that, as the chairman,
he's selected Apollo to be the
attorney in charge of the case.
He also warns Apollo that,
though this is just a test case,
the verdict is for real. Court's
currently sitting at 10 AM
tomorrow. Phoenix changed his
initial choice for something
that happened just recently. In
fact, it happened last night.
Time to change the topic.

Talk about "Valant Gramarye".
Trucy wants to head on over to
the Colisseum to say "hi" to
Valant. Phoenix suggests tagging
along with her, saying that
Apollo will learn all about the
case tomorrow, but he wants to
know sooner than that. The name
"Gramarye" gets the gears
turning in Phoenix's head, and
he hands over a pink envelope
with the symbol of a guy wearing
a top hat on it to Trucy. She
asks Phoenix if she can open it,
but Phoenix, suddenly stern,
orders her not to. What could be
in there? The Gramarye Envelope
will be added to the court
record. Back to the matter at
hand. Talk about "The trial
simulation". Apollo wants to
know what kind of case he's
dealing with, and Phoenix, with
all of the power vested in him,
gives him permission to examine
the scene of the crime, but he
can't talk to anyone involved
with the case. Well, except for
his client: Apollo CAN talk with
them, but Phoenix warns him that
he may be wasting his time with
them. They're in the detention
center right now. Head on over
there.

We've been here for twenty
minutes, and they're STILL not
here! When asked, the guard will
point out that she's just out of
sight. Talk about shy. The
client takes her seat in
silence, and Trucy tries to
brighten the mood a little by
bringing out Mr. Hat.
Unfortunately, this has the
unintended side effect of making
the client pass out cold. She
quickly regains conciousness.
Talk to the client about
"Introductions". Apollo tries to
make some small talk, but
there's no effect. Next, talk to
her about "Your name?" Apollo
introduces himself to the
client. Again, she's silent.
Finally, talk about "The case".
As before, she's as talkative as
a rock, which is not at all. She
does, however, pull out an
oddly-shaped bottle of nail
polish, and uses it on her
nails. Looks like Phoenix was
right: there's not much we can
get out of her. Before Apollo
and Trucy can leave, however,
the client calls them back. She
hands over a business card. The
name on the card is Vera Misham,
and according to this, she's an
artist at the Drew Art Studio.
Vera's Card will be added to the
court record. Wait. Is the
client's name Vera, the name on
the card? Vera once more slips
out of sight. Well, at least we
know her name, but we still
don't have any information on
the crime. Maybe someone at the
studio can help us some more.
Head to the "Drew Studio".

Well, it looks like the studio
is the scene of the crime
itself. There are a bunch of
paintings lying around, but one
seems oddly unfinished, and the
sketch that's showing looks
nothing like the finished
product. All three paintings
will be added to the court
record as the Portrait, the
Acrylic, and the Landscape. This
is when Ema shows up. Ema
informs the pair that the victim
was the owner of the studio, Mr.
Drew Misham, who also happens to
be Vera's father. The method of
murder was done through
poisoning. Phoenix told Ema that
Apollo would drop by and he has
full access to the scene. Talk
to Ema about "The victim". Drew
did a lot of illustration work
for picture books, as the rumor
goes. Drew and Vera never really
interacted with the world
outside their home, and that
lasted up till Drew's death. He
never used any sort of
electronic communications, so
the only line open he had to the
outside world was through snail
mail. The letter box was put
there for precisely that reason.
The Letter Box will be added to
the court record. When the
police took fingerprints, only
Vera's and Drew's prints were
found. But last night was the
first time that Drew let a
reporter into his studio. Drew
died during the interview that
followed. Next, talk about "The
defendant". As mentioned before,
Vera never really had any
interaction with the world, and
she was home-schooled by her
father. Apparently, Vera
absolutely refused to leave, and
if they did, then she'd probably
die. In the end, she was allowed
her lucky charm as company to
the big house. She claims that
this charm gives her the power
to go into the world if she
absolutely had to. Apollo asks
Ema if the coffee was poisoned,
but she evades the question.
Next, talk about "The night of
the crime". Apollo immediately
suspects the reporter, but Ema
says that around the same time
every night, Vera would serve
her father a cup of coffee, and
the reporter was nowhere near
Drew when he died, since he was
looking at the machinery on the
other side of the room.
Incidentally, it was the
reporter that called the police
after the murder occured.
Examine the painting stuffed
behind the dresser. It looks
oddly familiar... The Hidden
Painting will be added to the
court record. Next, examine the
coffee mug. It was the last cup
of coffee Drew ever drank. But
something's off about it... Part
of it must be because there were
no traces of poison found in the
coffee itself. The Coffee Mug
will be added to the court
record. Next, examine the small
table on the other side of the
room. We'll zoom in to have a
closer look. Examine the red
envelope in the drawer. It's
been opened before, as evidenced
by all the tape used to seal it.
But the postmark on the envelope
has a date seven years old. Why
would a seven-year-old letter be
here? The Red Envelope will be
added to the court record.
Examine the Coffee Mug in closer
detail. Examine the blue spot on
the rim of the mug. Trucy thinks
that it may be a special type of
coffee, but Apollo is skeptical.
What could it be? Present the
Coffee Mug to Ema. She tries to
get away with the new coffee
thing, but Apollo voices his
doubts. Ema gives in: the blue
mark on the rim indicates the
presence of poison. The poison
was only found on the mug
itself. But why such a small
spot? Next, present the Red
Envelope to her. Ema refuses to
talk about it, which means that
she must know what's inside, but
she didn't rip the envelope
open. Maybe it's another one of
her scientific toys.

Talk to Ema about "Forensic
science". Apollo woos Ema into
helping him do some forensic
investigation. Looks like she
likes being flattered. All we
need to do is present something
suspicious to her. Present the
Coffee Mug to her again. This
time, she'll let us use her
poison detection spray. It's
used to test for the poison
atroquinine, which,
incidentally, is the poison that
was used to murder Mr. Misham.
Atroquinine is one of the
deadliest poisons around, but it
takes time to take it's toll, 15
minutes tops. This part is just
like testing for blood, but this
time, we're looking for traces
of poison. Just spray anywhere:
you won't get a reaction. Trucy
suggests looking at that small
table for a closer look. When
you zoom in, spray that tiny
picture frame. There are traces
of atroquinine, but why were
they found here? The Tiny Frame
will be added to the court
record. Next, present the Red
Envelope to Ema. She explains
what the device she's carrying
around is: she calls it an X-Ray
Scanner, but it actually has a
real name, and Ema doesn't seem
to remember it. She decides to
let Apollo and Trucy to try it
on a concealed lottery ticket.
Ema explains that a piece of
paper has many layers, and some
layers hold writing on them
while others do not. By
selecting a specific layer, one
can see what is written on that
layer. In order to form a
complete image, however, you
need to rub the image (rub the
touch screen). Ema will now
leave you to your business. To
select another layer, use the
stylus to turn the dial. Keep
rubbing the screen on all of the
layers and the message will be
revealed. Thusly, Ema will print
out an image that contains the
writing. Ema will now let Apollo
and Trucy have at it with the
concealed letter. Just do what
you did with the ticket, and
you'll be fine. But there are
two pieces of paper in the
envelope, which means that
there's more of the letter. Use
the scanner again, and the full
contents of the letter will be
revealed. It reads: "Mr. Drew
Misham. I've deposited the
$100,000 in the designated
account. Please send a reciept
once you've confirmed the
transfer. Sign the papers and
send in the enclosed envelope
with the enclosed stamp within 3
days. I need not remind you to
speak of this to no one." Well,
Drew certainly made a killing on
one of his works, but why all
the secrecy? And why was this
letter even here? Ema knows
something, but her mouth is shut
tight. The Red Envelope data
will be updated in the court
record. Before he leaves, Apollo
asks Ema about the reporter. She
really can't talk about him,
since, he's going to be a
witness, but she can tell Apollo
who he is. She can't remember
his name, but she does have his
business card. The guy's name
is... Spark Brushel? Ema
mentions that Brushel went to
see Valant at the Colisseum
about the show. Brushel's Card
will be added to the court
record. Looks like it's time to
head out and talk with the man.
Move to the Colisseum.

Valant is overjoyed to see Trucy
again. Trucy congradulates
Valant on a big step forward,
but he's not at all humbled to
hear it. Guy's got a big ego.
Talk to Valant about "The big
magic show". Valant acknowledges
that Zak should be the one
performing Magnifi's tricks.
He'd be happy to stand up there
as an assistant if Zak were
still around. Next, talk about
"Magnifi Gramarye". Valant's
mentor was incredibly gifted,
and as the heir to the secret,
he's going to be providing a
miracle. But why did he have to
wait for seven years? It was due
to a law that prevented him from
doing so. It was known as
"Performance rights". Talk to
him about this next. Magnifi's
illusions relied on an
innovative idea that he alone
came up with. As such, the
secret to his illusions was
considered to be his property,
and without his permission, no
one could perform them. Magnifi,
before he died, passed on the
rights to Zak, but shortly after
Magnifi died, Zak vanished,
taking the rights with him. Just
now, Zak was declared legaly
dead, and, due to the principle
known as "death in abstantia",
Valant automatically inherited
the rights when Zak was declared
dead. Now, present the Gramarye
Envelope to Valant. He takes one
quick look and suddenly becomes
a nervous wreck. He asks Trucy
where she got it from, because
the handwriting on the envelope
belongs to Zak! What!? He asks
to open the letter, but Apollo
can't let him, since Phoenix
told us not to open it until the
time is right. Finally, present
Brushel's Card. He definately
knows who he is, as he can't
forget that strong scent of
mint. Looks like he's not fond
of the guy. Talk to him about
"Mr. Brushel, Journalist".
Brushel wanted to chat about
what happened in the past, but
Valant sent him packing. Looks
like he's got someting in his
past that he'd rather not
remember. Valant says that
Brushel headed off to the
detention center (probably to
interview Vera...). Valant
suddenly takes Brushel's card
and rips it to shreds! He
doesn't restore it like a good
magician should. Wow, he REALLY
must not have liked the guy!
Head to the detention center.

Someone must be here: they're
interviewing the guard. Huh.
Must be that Brushel guy. The
man FINALLY shows his face. He
looks a bit wierd to me. Brushel
tried to interview Vera, but
evidently failed, and resorted
to interviewing the guard. Oy
vey. Talk to Brushel about
"Spark Brushel". Brushel really
doesn't want to do the
answering: he's a reporter,
after all. Next, talk to him
about "The night of the crime".
Since he's gonna be a witness,
he doesn't want to talk about
that night just yet. Now talk
about "The interview". Something
tipped Brushel off about Drew,
and that's why he went to do the
interview, using a metaphor we
FINALLY understand. As it so
happens, he was on a trip when
he saw an article in a tabloid
detailing the theft of a famous
painting. The picture in the
article looked like a giant
peach floating down a river?
Does that sound familiar to you?
It should: we have that same
exact painting in the court
record! But why did Drew have
that painting in the first
place? Sounds like it's time to
interrogate Ema. Head back to
the studio.

Present the Hidden Painting to
Ema. Ema admits that Drew was
actually a forger of art pieces.
Talk to Ema about Drew being a
"Forger". A forger is someone
who makes copies of something,
but they try to sell these
forgeries, or fakes, as the
genuine article, and that's
against the law. That's why Drew
was so successful: he was being
paid to make these forgeries. In
fact, that's why Ema brought her
scanner: to see what's
underneath these forged pieces
of art. But she really didn't
need to go that far, since one
of the forgeries is only half
done. Still, it'd be a good idea
to see what Drew sketched before
he painted over them. Present
any of the other three paintings
to Ema, and she'll let you take
a peek at them using the
scanner. Select the first one,
the Picasso-like piece. The
sketch underneath looks like a
game of cards. Huh. That sounds
familiar. Next, select the
painting of a fish. The sketch
looks like a man pulling a cart.
Do you see a connection yet? I
do! Apollo will ask to see the
last painting, the half-done
one. The sketch is that of a
flaming man wielding a guitar!
Apollo asks Trucy to take a look
at the three sketches. She soon
gets the picture, but Ema is
still clueless. Apollo explains
that each of the sketches
represents a case that he's been
involved in! They represent, in
order, the murder in the Borscht
Bowl Club, the circumstances
surrounding Meraktis's death,
and the concert which culminated
in the loss of LeTouse's life!
Who is this guy? Save your game.

:DAY 2 " TRIAL, PART 1:

Apollo and Trucy ask Vera if
she's alright, but all she does
is draw a smiley face in her
notebook to signify that she's
just fine. Again, she puts on
her good luck charm. Drew was a
forger before he died, so it may
have to do something with the
case at hand. Time to head in.

Klavier is as cool and collected
as ever, but the judge is a bit
nervous, since it's the first
use of the Jurist System. While
they may not be in the
courtroom, they're still
watching the trial, through some
video cameras. Since the outcome
depends on what the believe is
the truth, the old addage of
"Evidence is everything" no
longer applies. Klavier gives
out his opening statement,
saying that Vera murdered her
father by poisoning his coffee.
Apollo objects right off the bat
with the fact that the coffee
had no traces of poison
whatsoever. Klavier agrees,
handing out the autopsy report
as well. Misham's Autopsy Report
will be added to the court
record. Klavier identifies the
poison as atroquinine, a man-
made poison so deadly, that only
0.002 milligrams is enough to be
fatal. He calls up the decisive
witness for this simple case to
the stand. Something tells me
that this case is far from
simple...

Well, if it isn't our old
friend, Mr. Brushel. He's
testifying so that he can grab
up the exclusive rights to the
report. The judge asks Brushel
to testify about that night.

SPARK BRUSHEL'S FIRST TESTIMONY:
THE JOURNALIST'S STORY
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I visited the studio that night

-The first outsider to enter the
end quote.

-His daughter brought us coffee 

-And you know what happened next

-No one else entered the room be

The judge suspects Brushel of
poisoning Misham, but that's
impossible, since he was nowhere
near Misham's coffee when he
died. Time for the cross. Press
his fouth statement, the one
about a star falling. Brushel
simplifies it to Drew dying. Ask
about "The "star's" coffee" in
more detail. Brushel claims that
as soon as Misham took a sip, he
died. Is this important in any
way? Answer that it's "Very
important". Brushel will now
amend his testimony:

-He had one sip, if that. The ne

Present the Coffee Mug against
this statement. Remember what
Ema told us? She said that
atroquinine is slow-acting! He
couldn't have died immediately!
Klavier asks that Brushel
provide an explanation. Brushel,
standing by his statement that
Misham's death was immediate,
tells the court that Vera even
admitted she served him that
cup! Klavier admits that he
should have known better:
there's no way that Phoenix
would ever choose such a simple
case! Klavier asks that Brushel
testify about what he noticed.

SPARK BRUSHEL'S SECOND
TESTIMONY: WHAT BRUSHEL NOTICED
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-When I arrived at the studio, M

-He seemed to be writing a lette

-I thought nothing of it at the 

-Now that I think about it, what

Press Brushel's second
statement, the one about the
letter. He managed to see this
because he showed up 15 minutes
early. Mr. Misham was suprised,
and stuffed the letter away in a
yellow envelope. Is this
important? Choose "Add to
testimony". Brushel will now
amend his testimony:

-It was a yellow envelope. ...I 

Present the Red Envelope against
this statement. Not only is this
envelope the wrong color
according to his testimony, it's
also addressed to Drew himself.
Why would he write a suicide
note to himself? Klavier admits
that the red envelope was the
only one found at the scene.
Brushel claims that he used an
envelope, regardless of the
color. Is it possible that he
chose the wrong color to go
with? Answer "It's impossible".
We already investigated the
contents of the leter, and it
had to do with one of his jobs,
most likely having to do with
forgery. The judge asks Brushel
for an explanation, and the
reporter remembers another
detail: after he came in and
Misham put the letter in the
envelope, he sat at his desk,
searching for a stamp with the
intent to mail it. After that,
Misham put the letter in his
letter box. The judge decides
that the letter has nothing to
do with the murder. He then asks
to see the contents of the
letter. The judge is astonished
with the amount of cash, and
Brushel, smelling news, asks to
leave. Apollo points out that
he's not going anywhere. The
judge asks Brushel to testify
about his scoop.

SPARK BRUSHEL'S THIRD TESTIMONY:
THE SCENT OF A STORY
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-Actually, it took a bit of work

-"Reporter Leverages Story, Gets

-The story concerned a case from

-Say what you will, but Drew's t

Does this have to do with
Phoenix's last case? Time to
find out. Unfortunately, Brushel
isn't willing to reveal his
source. Let's approach this from
a different angle. Use the
bracelet on his last statement,
the one about Drew's "talent".
Move your focus to his armpit.
When he starts to sweat, press
Percieve. Present the Hidden
Painting as proof of Drew's
"talent": making forgeries!
Brushel finally spills the
beans: Not only did Drew make
forged art, he also forged
evidence! So THAT'S what that
payment was for: a forged piece
of evidence! Apollo pounces,
suggesting that there are a lot
of criminals out there who may
have wanted Misham dead. Klavier
counters, saying that there's no
proof tying the red envelope and
the murder together. The judge
asks that Brushel provides a
summary of his testimony.

SPARK BRUSHEL'S FINAL TESTIMONY:
THE INTERVIEW: A RECAP

Press his fourth statement, the
one about nothing leaving the
scene after the murder. Brushel
claims that only one thing left
the crime scene: himself!
Brushel then claims that he was
joking, and the judge turns to
the defense, asking Apollo if
anything else might have left
the scene. Answer "Just one
thing". Something else has
vanished from the crime scene!
We don't have what was missing,
but we DO have the evidence that
shows how it left! Present the
Letter Box: since Brushel is
still adamant that a letter was
sent out, that must mean the
letter must have something to do
with the murder! We're missing a
valuable piece of evidence!
Klavier objects, saying that
this bit of info isn't
important. Apollo continues to
insist that it is, and the judge
gives in, asking Brushel to
amend his testimony:

-A letter was put in the post fr
matters.

Press Brushel's third statement
this time, the one about nothing
else but the coffee touching his
lips that night. Apollo asks him
if he's sure, but Brushel was
devouring mints at that time
(must be where his minty-fresh
breath comes from...). Apollo
argues that the poison could
have been concealed in the
mints, but Klavier objects,
pointing out the obvious fact
that Brushel's still standing.
When asked if there's proof that
Misham could have been poisoned
some other way, say "I can prove
it." If Misham sent out a
letter, then he must have licked
a stamp to do so! That gets the
gears turning in Brushel's head,
and he reveals that, though
Misham was looking for a stamp,
he never found one. Maybe the
poison came from a stamp that he
was forced to use! That's why
traces of the poison were found
on the mug: his tounge
tranfrered the poison he had
just ingested to the cup itself!
Klavier, however points out the
fallacy in our theory: the fact
that Misham never found a stamp.
There's no proof he ever found
one! Present the Tiny Frame: not
only were traces of the poison
found on this frame, it's
juuuuuust the right size to hold
a stamp! Brushel comes up with a
conclusion: someone must have
been trying to kill him with
that stamp, and their plan
worked! After all, Misham was a
forger of evidence. He was also
a recluse, meaning that they had
to kill him in this fashion!
Klavier says that there's no
proof that Misham was sent a
poisoned stamp! Present the Red
Envelope: this letter was sent
to him seven years ago. Maybe
the stamp was sent to him using
this! Klavier obvjects, saying
that there's no proof the stamp
was sent to Misham using that
letter! That's when someone else
takes the stand. It's...
Kristoph Gavin!?

No, wait, it's just Ema
imitating him. She says that
there is one way to prove that a
poisoned stamp was sent to him:
test the letter itself using the
poison-detecting spray! The
judge allows Apollo to open the
letter for poison analysis.
Spray near the bottom-right
corner of the page. Lo and
behold, it's atroquinine
residue! Klavier asks why this
murder didn't take place
earlier, but Ema can come up
with only one solution: maybe
Misham saw through the murder
plot and put that stamp in a
frame to warn himself to not use
it! Again, Klavier jumps in,
saying that if Misham did
realize that someone was trying
to kill him, he never would have
used that stamp! That means that
one of our pieces of evidence
must be throwing us off track.
Which one? Answer that the fake
clue is "Drew Misham." Think
about it: One forger must have
known the danger, and one forger
must have walked right into it.
Maybe Drew Misham wasn't the
real forger! Then who's the real
forger? Present Vera's profile:
she's the only one left that
could be the forger! Vera is
called up to the stand, and she
confirms that she IS the forger!
The crowd goes nuts, and failing
to calm them, the judge calls a
recess. It may seem like a storm
now, but believe me, this is
only the calm BEFORE the storm.
Save your game.

:DAY 2 " TRIAL, PART 2:

In the lobby, Vera reveals that
she created those forgeries for
her father. Her father, who was
not a successful painter, often
let Vera play in the studio. It
was by chance that he discovered
that she had the gift of making
perfect replicas. Her father
encouraged her, and the closer
she got to the real thing, the
happier he was. She's never had
any real contact with the world
and she knows this. She blames
herself and their lifestyle for
the predicament they're in. So
that red envelope was meant for
her after all! Before they head
back in, Trucy asks Vera about
the sketches that were
underneath the forgeries. Vera
tells the two that her father
kept a close eye on Phoenix and
the Agency, and when he learned
that Apollo was working for
Phoenix, he was very ecstatic.
But why would the victim have
been obsessed with Phoenix so
much?

Vera's so nervous that she's
biting her nails off. But when
Klavier starts to speak, she
stares straight at him. Why is
that? Klavier asks her if she
painted the forgery seen
earlier, and she responds in the
positive. So, two people were
behind the operation: she would
do the dirty work while her
father set up all the deals,
making HIM look like the forger
and taking the heat off of his
daughter. The judge asks Vera to
testify about her history of
forgery, starting with the
mystery of the red envelope.

VERA MISHAM'S TESTIMONY: THE RED
ENVELOPE
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-...I created things and
    Father sold them...

-...This envelope came after
    my first work... that was
    other than a painting...

-...Father handled the deal,
    all of it...

-...I recieved the stamp that
    was in that envelope...

-...It was after that job that
    we moved to the current
    studio...

(As a note, I have decided to
render Vera's testimony the
exact same way as seen in the
game itself, in case you were
wondering.)

What you need to do here is
press all of her statements. The
"things" she mentions in her
testimony are the forgeries she
has been contracted to do. She
began this line of work when she
was only twelve. However, her
father eventually realized that
she could recreate anything,
given the right materials, such
as a letter someone had written,
or a page in a diary. That was
when the Mishams started to
forge evidence. She had no idea
what she was doing was illegal.
However, she stole the stamp in
the envelope, not because she
thought the sender was trying to
kill her, but because she really
liked the stamp that they sent.
It looks like she had no idea
that stamp was poisonous! It was
a commerative stamp, it looks
like. They moved, perhaps,
because Drew wanted to cut his
connections with the criminal
world. They saw very few people,
and, in that way, they were
safe. Well, they were until her
father was poisoned. Apollo asks
Vera about the stamp. Vera says
that the stamp was of some
people that she admired at the
time. Klavier asks Vera to
revise her testimony:

-...The stamp was a picture of
    my favorite magicians... so
    I kept it...

Magicians? Could she be talking
about Troupe Gramarye!? Present
the Magic Show Ticket against
this statement. Vera confirms:
the magicians she was so
enamoured with were members of
the Troupe. Klavier suddenly
starts to sweat bullets. He asks
if the piece of evidence she
first forged was a page from a
diary. She confirms, and Klavier
goes ballistic! He then asks if
it had the Gramarye symbol on
it, and again, she confirms.
Apollo tells Klavier not to yell
at Vera. Klavier finally
realizes that Apollo doesn't
know all the details of
Phoenix's final trial: it was
this precise piece of forged
evidence that got Phoenix
disbarred! Apollo, in shock,
asks Vera who ordered the
forgery. She only met them once,
but before she can say their
name, she starts coughing! As
she falls to the ground, limp,
she says that the person who
ordered the forgery was "the
devil".

A while later a report comes in
from the hospital: she's
currently being treated for
Atroquinine poisoning, and she's
not to be disturbed for any
reason. This case may have
looked to be simple on the
surface, but it has now beared
it's fangs. Before we can solve
this mystery, we must go back in
time seven years, to see the
moment of Phoenix's fall from
the spotlight. Save your game.

:SEVEN YEARS AGO " TRIAL, PART
1:

It's been quite some time since
Phoenix has felt like such a
rookie. Well, that's to be
expected, since he took the case
just last night. That's when a
guy wearing a pink outfit pops
up and says not to sweat it.
This is Mr. Shadi Enigmar,
better known to the world at
large as the famous magician,
Zak Gramarye. Zak is very
confident, even going so far as
to say that it's "impossible"
for the judge to hand down a
guilty verdict. Zak's daughter
Trucy shows up, offering words
of encouragement. She also gives
Phoenix a piece of paper: looks
like a page torn out of a book.
The Notebook Page will be added
to the court record. Phoenix
knows that the prosecutor for
the case is new, and he's one of
those prodigies everyone's
talking about every year.
Phoenix isn't really impressed:
he's faced down tougher
prosecutors than some sort of
god of rock.

The nostalgia-fest continues
with the old-style graphics! The
judge is as pleased to see
Phoenix in the courtroom as
ever, but the prosecutor, one
Klavier Gavin, is confident in
his ability to prove his case.
He calls up his first witness,
who is none other than good 'ol
Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe sets
up the scene: on April 13th,
Magnifi Gramarye was murdered in
his hospital room using a gun.
He was shot in the forehead, but
the strange thing about the
murder is that Magnifi was
already dying: he had liver
cancer and diabetes, and he only
had about three months left. Why
murder the guy if he was already
preparing for a trip on the
Double-Nine? (Yes, this SHOULD
mean something to players of
Grim Fandango...) Magnifi's
Chart will be added to the court
record. In fact, Magnifi was
about to take his insulin when
he was shot. The syringe found
at the scene proves it. The
Small Syringe will be added to
the court record. Klavier asks
Gumshoe to testify about the
circumstances surrounding the
murder.

DICK GUMSHOE'S TESTIMONY: THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-Actually... the victim kind of 

-A few days before it happened, 
own murder.

-The defendant did what was aske
forehead!

-The bullet was fired from the p
it.

-And the pistol definitely belon

Magnifi ordered his own disciple
to murder him!? That's hard to
believe. Klavier, however, has
the letter proving it. Magnifi's
Letter will be added to the
court record. Magnifi must have
had some sort of hold on Zak, as
demonstrated by the line: "You
cannot refuse, and we both know
the reason why." Unfortunately,
Zak is unwilling to talk about
this reason. However, why did
Magnifi have Zak come at that
specific time? Klavier explains
that from 11 PM to 11:30 PM,
Magnifi was undergoing an IV,
and the doctors left him alone
during this timeframe. That was
the only way to meet with him
without an interruption. Time
for the cross.

Press Gumshoe's third statement,
the one about the forehead.
Gumshoe's certain since the
letter also mentions the
forehead. They also found the
pistol at the scene, and the
residue proves that it was fired
recently. But was it used to
shoot the victim? Answer that
Zak "shot something else." Look
closely at the photo: the clown
has a hole in it's forehead too!
The letter never says which
forehead to shoot, after all!
When asked, point to the hole in
the clown's forehead. The judge
asks that the doll be examined
further. Klavier objects, saying
that there's no proof that Zak
didn't shoot Magnifi too! The
judge asks Gumshoe to revise his
testimony:

-So what if he shot the clown? H

Press the statement befote this
one, the one about the pistol
belonging to Magnifi. He
actually recieved the pistol
from Zak, when he and his
partner stopped doing a special
trick: they would shoot at an
assistant while they were
levitating in the air.
Amazingly, the bullets never hit
her: they just went through her
as if she wasn't there! Next,
press his fourth statement, the
one about the bullet. They
compared the rifling marks from
the gun and the bullet, and they
matched. The judge asks to see
the pistol, and Gumshoe notes
that the pistol can only hold
one round. Since the chamber is
empty, the bullet inside was
already fired. Plus, there are
no fingerprints on the pistol,
but since Zak wears gloves, it's
trivial. The Stage Pistol will
be added to the court record.
Finally, present the Stage
Pistol against Gumshoe's last
statement, the one about
shooting both the doll and the
victim. Since the pistol can
only hold one bullet, Zak could
have shot either the clown or
the victim, but he couldn't have
done both! Klavier objects,
saying that all Zak had to do
was reload the pistol after he
shot the clown! Phoenix
counters, saying that there's no
proof that Zak had another
bullet ready to go! Klavier then
giggles a bit, and declares that
he's ready to call in his next
witness. He claims that this
witness is very decisive indeed.
Yeah, like that's ever worked!
The judge calls a recess while
the witness is prepared. This
will give us some time to see
what we can get from Zak. Save
your game.

:SEVEN YEARS AGO " TRIAL, PART
2:

Back in the lobby, Phoenix asks
Zak about that night. Zak
couldn't refuse Magnifi's
request, but he won't say why.
He, however, did not want to
shoot his mentor. He came into
the room at the appointed time,
but, according to his account,
there were TWO pistols on his
bedside table. The other pistol
belonged to Zak's partner,
Valant. When Zak came in,
Magnifi was pretending to sleep.
Zak's iron-clad resolve wavered
as the moment came, since there
were many other requests that he
couldn't refuse either. But,
when the moment came, he instead
shot the doll. If the whole
thing about the two pistols is
true, then when the police
examine the rifling marks on
both bullets, they'll find out
that they were shot from
different pistols. Zak took the
pistol he had used and left with
it. Just one more thing before
we head back in: when Zak shot
the clown, Magnifi opened his
eyes. They talked, then Zak
left. But what did they talk
about? Zak won't say. Let's see
who Klavier's "decisive" witness
is, shall we?

Well, well, if it isn't Valant!
He seems to be a bit more
professional that when we saw
him seven years later. Valant
was in the hospital that night
as well. The letter he recieved
from Magnifi is almost identical
to the one that was sent to Zak.
About the only difference is the
time: Valant was to arrive 11:20
that night. Magnifi's Letter 2
will be added to the court
record. If Valant was there that
night and Zak didn't do it, then
that leaves Valant as the prime
suspect. Valant also had a
reason he couldn't refuse
Magnifi's request, but, like
Zak, he's mum about the details.
The judge asks Valant as to what
he witnessed that night.

VALANT GRAMARYE'S FIRST
TESTIMONY: THE NIGHT OF THE
CRIME
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-That night, I visited the hospi

-The smell of gunpowder hung in 
final bow.

-I did not imagine my fellow stu
instructions!

-Yet a deal with the dead is sti
to the clown.

-Then I informed the doctor and 

Press his fourth statement, the
one about shooting the clown.
The problem here is that whoever
shot the clown is innocent, and
Valant seems to have caught on.
Plus, Zak is denying that he
shot anyone, so Valant must be
lying. Ask Valant about "the
number of pistols." Valant
claims that there was only one
pistol on the table when he came
in to see Magnifi. Say that the
number of pistols at that table
is "Quite important". Valant
will now amend his testimony:

-Only one pistol was in the hosp
the clown.

Present the Stage Pistol against
this statement: there were two
pistols in the room that night,
and the markings on the gun Zak
is currently carrying wouldn't
match the markings on the bullet
found in Magnifi's head! Klavier
objects, admitting that, since
he didn't know that two pistols
were made, the tests only
confirmed the TYPE of weapon
used to shoot the victim! Gah!
Klavier asks that Valant testify
as to the proof of his
innocence.

VALANT GRAMARYE'S FINAL
TESTIMONY: WHO SHOT WHAT
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-I arrived in the hospital room 
11:20 PM.

-After discovering the body, I f
the doctor.

-The doctor examined the body be

-He was quite clear about the ti

-And the one in the room at that

This is some rather precise
timing, so any irrelevant
pressing will net you a penalty.
With that said, press Valant's
fourth statement, the one about
the time of death. Klavier steps
in, saying that Magnifi was
taking his IV at the time. When
Magnifi was shot, the IV's
needle was shaken out of his
arm, and the medication stopped
flowing into the victim. By
examining how much liquid was
left in the bag, the doctor was
able to verify the time of
death. The IV Report will be
added to the court record. Is
all this info about the IV
important? Oh, it's "Very
important". Valant will now
amend his testimony:

-The water of life springs not e
my innocence!

Press this statement. Valant,
after a moment or so, had
noticed that the IV needle had
been removed from Magnifi's arm.
Klavier tells Valant that he was
lucky: if that IV was still
functioning, he'd be a suspect
for sure. Valant suspects that
it's due to his lucky color.
Considering what color his
outfit is, I'd wager that it's
yellow. He even goes so far as
to claim that the IV liquid was
yellow. Take another look at the
Crime Photo: the liquid in the
bag is green, not yellow! Answer
"There's a contradiction" and
present the Crime Photo, then
point to the IV liquid. Klavier
object, saying that the IV
liquid IS yellow! The coloring
of the blue bag only makes the
liquid look like it's green.
He's even got the liquid in a
clear bag to prove it! Phoenix
objects himself, saying that
Klavier's just proven the
defense's case for us! Why?
Because now there's the question
of why Valant knew the
medicine's color. Maybe it's
because "he'd seen it before."
He saw it in one of those clear
bags that Klavier just showed
off. In fact, maybe he used some
of the liquid to water down the
bag in Magnifi's room to throw
off the time of death! To prove
it, present the Small Syringe:
Valant poked a hole through the
bag using the needle on the
syringe, and emptied the liquid
inside the syringe, right into
the remaining IV liquid in the
bag!

The judge seems convinced with
the defense's case, and is about
to call a recess when Klavier
objects! He's got another way to
prove his case, and THAT can't
bode well! He presents Magnifi's
diary as his evidence: Magnifi
had planned to write again
should Zak fail to kill him, but
since that's the last entry, it
proves that Zak murdered
Magnifi! Magnifi's Diary will be
added to the court record.
Examine the diary in closer
detail: it seems as though a
page was ripped out from the
diary. Maybe Magnifi wrote one
more entry! Now examine the
Notebook Page: it looks like
it's been ripped out from a
book! Looks like we have the
final page in our hands right
now! Choose to "show evidence",
then present the Notebook Page.
Just as the court is convinced
that Valant is the murderer,
Klavier objects, and asks to
bring in another witness that is
somehow related to the page. The
court is emptied out, and the
only ones left inside are
Phoenix, Klavier, the judge, the
court scribe and the new
witness, one Drew Misham. Once
he's on the stand, Drew
confesses that, on the request
of a client, he forged that very
page, but had no idea it was
going to be used in a court of
law. Well, that's just PERFECT.
We walked right into a trap.
Before he goes, Drew asks
Phoenix's name, promising to
never forget him. Just as the
judge is about to pronounce Zak
guilty, the magician laughs and
disappears into thin air! Due to
Zak's disappearance, no verdict
was ever declared, but the
mysteries surrounding the case
were all solved... but it would
take seven years for the truth
to come to light. Save your
game.

:MASON SYSTEM " INVESTIGATION:

As we move on, Phoenix, the
narrator for this case, tasks us
with using the Mason System to
examine all of the circumstances
surrounding both Magnifi's
7-year-old death, and Drew
Misham's more recent demise. The
system consists of 8 specific
moments in time that Phoenix
recalled: 4 happened in the
past, while the other 4 take
place in the current timeframe.
For now, the 4 "keys" in the
present are locked, but, by
examining the other "keys",
those memories will be unlocked.
Phoenix also reminds us that he
still has his magatama (yay for
more Psyche-locks!), so, without
further ado, let's begin the
"game". Start by initiating
memory #3: "Wright & Co. Law
Offices".

It's been a few weeks since the
trial ended, and thanks to the
inquiry that followed, Phoenix
was disbarred for deliberately
presenting forged evidence. In
this memory, Phoenix talks to
Trucy regarding her status.
Since she has no other living
relatives, Phoenix offers to
take her to an orphanage, or to
live with him until Zak returns.
Surprise, surprise, Trucy
decides to live with our
favorite spikey-haired ex-
lawyer.

(NOTE: The command "Move" has
been replaced with the command
"End Search", which will take
you back to the memory selection
screen.)

Talk to Trucy about "The
office". She insists that, since
Phoenix was "fired", they should
organize a talent agency. Next,
talk about "Daddy". Zak is part
of Troupe Gramarye, but they
haven't been on TV recently.
Trucy, however, wanted to see
more of Zak and her "Mommy"'s
magic. Wait. We haven't heard
anything tangible at all about
Trucy's mother yet! Next, talk
about "The professional". Trucy
wants to show off one of her
favorite tricks, since she's the
child of a pro magician. Given
her enthusiasm, answer "Please,
show me!" In the blink of an
eye, she unveils everyone's
favorite wooden mannequin, the
Amazing Mr. Hat! Phoenix is
shocked, to say the least. The
Amazing Mr. Hat will be added to
the court record. Next, talk
about "Mommy". Trucy says that
her mother was beautiful, always
smiling, even when she was on
stage with Zak and Valant. She
even has a picture in a locket
to show off. It may just be me,
but Trucy's mom looks a little
like Lamiroir, the witness from
Case 3. Trucy reveals that her
mother was named Thalassa.
Thalassa mysteriously
disappeared, but won't reveal
the specifics. Well, this
mystery just keeps getting
deeper and deeper. Trucy's
Locket will be added to the
court record. Trucy then
instructs Phoenix to rise and
shine, since the Wright Talent
Agency is opening it's doors
bright and early! Phoenix is
taken aback, knowing that you
need more than one person to
open an agency. Well, Trucy then
takes that opportunity to name
her new "daddy" as the second
man! Phoenix is a little unsure,
since he doesn't have any
talents worth mentioning (well,
besides practicing law...), but
he'll give it a good think.

And that, friends, is how Trucy
Enigmar became Trucy Wright.
Phoenix was in some dark times
then, but Trucy's enthusiasm
became his shining beacon of
hope. We will now automatically
exit the memory. Now open up
memory #2: "Defendant Lobby No.
2".

As Phoenix steps in, missing the
badge on his lapel, a screechy
voice tells him to "HALT!" If
you've played Case 1-5, you
should know that this guy is
Mike Meekins. And if not, say
hello to baliff Mike Meekins!
Talk to Meekins about, well,
"Meekins". Meekins reveals that
he was fired because he
misplaced 4 reports... in three
days. Ouch. But Meekins managed
to sneak out his old police
uniform before he left. As
Phoenix says, that can't be
legal. Next, talk about "The
magician's disappearance".
Meekins heard the commotion from
the courtroom, and as he was
about to enter to see what was
up, the doors slammed open as
Zak ran into him. Zak rounded
the corner towards the lobbies,
and, after some hesitation,
Meekins followed suit. He saw
Zak head right into Lobby No.,
but as soon as Meekins showed
up, Zak was nowhere to be seen.
Meekins looked, but it's obvious
he's hiding something. Talk to
Meekins about "The vanishing
trick". Meekins looked all over,
but there was nothing there.
When Phoenix asks about any
tricks Zak might have used,
Meekins clams up, tossing out 2
locks to protect himself. Press
the X button or touch the
Magatama to begin the unlocking.

MIKE MEEKINS' PSYCHE-LOCK: THE
DISAPPEARING TRICK ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~ Phoenix asks Meekins about
how Zak disappeared, but
Meekins' trap is firmly shut.
But as he blunders on, he
reveals that a girl was in the
room when he barged in. Are you
thinking what I'm thinking? If
you are, present Trucy's
profile: she'd have been the
only girl in the room at the
time. Meekins' high-pitched
voice shatters one lock. Phoenix
raises the possibility of Trucy
being a decoy, but Meekins
expresses his doubts, saying
that he could have told the
difference between a little girl
and a grown adult. Prove him
wrong by presenting The Amazing
Mr. Hat: it's easily as tall as
Zak is, and, using her favorite
trick, Trucy managed to fool
Meekins into thinking that she
was the fugitive magician.
Unlock successful!

Talk about "The vanishing
trick". When Meekins chased
"Zak" into Lobby No. 2, all he
found was a little girl named
Trucy. He frantically searched
the entire lobby for the
magician, but, naturally,
couldn't find him. Then, about a
week after the incident, Meekins
was at the Wonder Bar, when he
saw Trucy pull out Mr. Hat, and
thought he had a case of deja
vu. Next, talk about "The trick
vanishes". Phoenix sums up what
happened on that day: Zak, after
making his escape from the
courtroom, fled past Meekins,
and, while Meekins stood there
confused for a while, escaped
into Lobby No. 1. Trucy, after
seeing Zak leave, pulled out Mr.
Hat and lured Meekins towards
Lobby No. 2. Once she was
inside, she put Mr. Hat away,
and the rest is history.

Phoenix apologizes to Meekins
about the incident. Meekins
perks up, saying that no one's
ever apologized to him before!
Phoenix also mentions that Trucy
is now living with him, but,
suprisingly, Meekins doesn't
harbor any hatred or dislike to
the ex-attorney: he admits that
he let Zak escape, trick or no
trick. To make it up further,
Phoenix also gives Meekins a
free ticket to Trucy's show
(suprise, suprise, he's never
been given anything for free
either). Well, we managed to
solve one part of the mystery,
but Zak's still missing. And,
according to Phoenix, it would
be seven years before he re-
emerged in the unlikeliest of
places...

When you exit the memory, the
first of the present memories
will be unlocked: the "Borcht
Bowl Club". Go ahead and enter
that memory.

Kristoph says his goodbyes to
Phoenix, hoping to see him again
soon. As Phoenix is about to
play a song, a man comes up with
a request to play poker.
Suprise, suprise, it's the
game's first victim, Shadi
Smith. But even more suprising
is the fact that he's not alone:
Brushel's with him too. Why is
that? As Phoenix stares at the
guy, it finally hits him in the
face: the man standing before
him is none other than Zak
Gramarye, the man who had cost
him his attorney's badge seven
years ago! Zak asks Olga to
prepare the Hydeout for the game
while Zak and Phoenix have a
little chat. Talk to Zak about
"The meaning of competition". To
men like Zak, you see a man's
true nature when they compete,
and that was why Zak took
Phoenix as his attorney all
those years ago for beating him
at a game of poker. But Trucy's
ability to percive tells is in a
league of it's own. In fact,
Trucy and her ancestors also
have or had this kind of talent.
When Phoenix asks if it's
hereditary, Zak throws up 3
locks, but we don't have enough
evidence to unlock the secret.
Instead, talk to Zak about
"About Trucy..." Phoenix informs
Zak that Trucy is still dead-set
on becoming a magician. Zak is
pleased to hear it, but he
didn't want to leave her behind
like he did after he fled the
courthouse. In fact, he was
planning to escape from the
beginning, because he had
Magnifi's transferral of rights.
If he was found guilty, the
rights would be revoked and
handed over to Valant. This
piece of paper is the REAL last
page from Magnifi's diary. Next,
talk about "Transferral of
rights". If Zak ever hoped to
perform Magnifi's magic, he
needed this document. In fact,
Zak came out of hiding to give
Phoenix a document detailing his
transferral of rights to Trucy.
That's why Brushel is here as
well: he's a certified notary,
making Phoenix a reliable
witness. The Transferral of
Rights will now be added to the
court record (it looks a lot
like that envelope Phoenix
handed Trucy...) Phoenix now
realizes why Zak came out of
hiding to have this document
signed: in a few days' time,
exactly seven years will have
passed.

Talk about "Seven years". In
Zak's situation, he's officially
declared missing until seven
years pass by: after that period
of time, he'll be declared
legally dead, and he'll lose all
of his rights, including the
rights to perform Magnifi's
magic, and since the original
transferral was done in secret,
Trucy wouldn't automatically
inherit them: instead, they'd
revert to Valant. This is why
Trucy needs this document to
legally perform Magnifi's magic.
Now three people know the truth:
Zak, Phoenix, and Brushel. He
also confirms that Trucy has no
other close kin, but he doesn't
mention Thalassa at all. Present
Trucy's Locket to Zak. Zak
confirms that Thalassa is gone,
but Brushel blurts out that
Thalassa was Magnifi's only
daughter, shedding a bit more
light on the situation. Zak,
enraged, decks Brushel.
Finished, Zak sends Brushel on
his way and calls Olga in to be
the dealer for the game. But
before the game, Zak does
mention that he knows Kristoph
from somewhere. In order to find
out why the late Zak Gramarye
knew Kristoph, we'll need to see
him again. Present Memory #2,
"Solitary Cell 13", will be
unlocked. Enter it.

It's been a while since
Kristoph's arrest, and he seems
pleasently suprised to see
Phoenix in his cell. Talk to
Kristoph about "Gavin's murder".
Phoenix informs Kristoph that
Shadi Smith was, in actuality,
Zak Gramarye, the magician that
disappeared seven years ago.
Kristoph seems shocked, but
Phoenix doubts it, since Zak
mentioned Kristoph by name that
night. Even though Kristoph was
found guilty of murdering Zak,
his motive for doing the deed
was never proven. Kristoph
claims that he doesn't need one
since he confessed. Still, if he
had no motive, then he had no
reason to kill him. Thus, he's
hiding something. Next, talk
about "7-year-old case". Klavier
had gained a lot of attention as
a result of the trial, and
around that time, Phoenix met
Kristoph. In fact, Kristoph was
the only attorney who objected
to the Association's unanimous
decision to disbar Phoenix, and
they've been friends ever since.
Kristoph, however, notes that
Phoenix has always suspected him
of forging the evidence in the
first place. Next, talk about
"Reason for murder". Phoenix
asks Kristoph once more about
his motive, and reveals that Zak
had mentioned him. Kristoph
protects himself by throwing up
5 BLACK Psyche-Locks. Not even
the Magatama can break them,
which means that Kristoph
definitely has a connection with
that case. Finally, examine the
bottle on the table. It's nail
polish, and Kristoph is kind
enough to give us a free bottle.
The Nail Polish will be added to
the court record. Select "End
Search", and move back to the
past to enter Past Memory #4,
"Drew Studio".

Drew meets Phoenix, reminiscing
about that fateful day. He was
fascinated by Phoenix's
reaction, but our favorite ex-
lawyer is used to outrageous
circumstances. Just then,
Phoenix gets the uneasy feeling
that he's being watched. Drew
introduces Phoenix to his
daughter, Vera. Talk to Drew
about "Mr. Misham". Drew
confesses that he's not a
successful artist. In fact, he's
never been able to sell his
paintings. As a result, Drew's
wife filed for divorce, leaving
Drew alone to raise Vera. Around
this time, Drew decided out of
desperation to create forgeries.
Talk to Drew about "The
forgeries". Drew knows that he's
involved in illegal business,
but he reveals that the fake
diary page was the first forgery
he had done outside of painting.
In fact, he was paid a king's
ransom to forge that page. But
he wants to forget about it, so
present the Notebook Page to
remind him. Phoenix confronts
Drew about it, saying that it
might have ruined the life of an
innocent man. Drew decides to
talk. Talk to Drew about
"Magnifi's diary". Drew explains
that, previously, all he had to
do was copy the original work,
but his client wanted a little
something more: he wanted
something written in Magnifi's
handwriting. But the client had
written this message from the
magician himself, and wanted the
message reproduced in his
handwriting. Phoenix asks Drew
who the client was. Drew
reiterates that he never met the
client, at least, not
personally. On cue, he throws up
two locks. Time to break him.

DREW MISHAM'S PSYCHE-LOCK:
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING ~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~ Phoenix asks Drew
what he's hiding, and Drew
continues to confess that he
never met the client. Well, it's
possible that Misham never met
the client, but someone else
probably did: remember what we
learned as Apollo in court. Drew
Misham was not the forger. So to
answer the question of what
Drew's hiding, select "The
forger". One lock shatters.
Phoenix then asks Drew who the
real forger is, but he can't
say. Again, remember what
happened during our time as
Apollo: Vera was the forger, not
her father. When prompted,
present Vera's profile. Unlock
successful!

Talk to Drew about "Magnifi's
diary" again. Drew confesses
that his daughter forged that
page, and the paintings that
came before it. He even calls
her a genius. In fact, he bought
those analytical devices and
drafting board for her to play
around with. That means that
Vera would know who the client
is, and Drew mentions that they
did come once, but they kept
their face hidden, and they
would only speak to Vera
privately. Now talk about "Your
daughter" and choose "Talk to
Vera": it's time to confront the
real forger. Drew informs
Phoenix that Vera is very shy
around strangers. But,
strangely, she took an instant
liking to that one specific
client. When they left and Drew
came back in, he saw her
laughing. Phoenix asks to see
Vera, and Drew brings her out,
but she's not very talkative at
the moment.

Instead, turn your attention to
the other side of the room and
examine the small table. Once
you've zoomed in, examine the
small frame. This time, the
frame isn't empty: inside is a
commemorative stamp of Troupe
Gramarye. Drew informs Phoenix
that the stamp belongs to Vera,
but he has no idea how she got
it. The Commemorative Stamp will
be added to the court record.
Present the stamp to Vera, and
she'll talk a bit. Select "Great
magicians, aren't they?" and
she'll speak a whole lot more,
confessing her love of magic and
the Gramaryes. She even asked
her father to take her to the
Gramarye Museum of Magic! Now
that she's talking, we'd better
get what we can out of her. Talk
to her about "Vera". Drew
informs Phoenix that the reason
she's so shy around strangers is
that she was kidnapped some time
ago, and developed the notion
that everyone outside of her
home wanted her dead. In fact,
the only time she wanted to go
outside was to see the Gramarye
Museum. Vera went because she
got a good-luck charm from the
client. But she won't tell
anyone what it is, for fear of
the charm losing it's
effectiveness. Great. Next, talk
to her about "The forgeries".
Vera loves to paint, and she got
happy when her father was happy,
and he got happy when she
painted the exact same thing she
was given. When the request from
that client came, though, she
was enamored with the work that
was needed to create the
evidence. But it looks like she
doesn't know that she
effectively sealed the Troupe's
fate. Next, talk to Vera about
"Troupe Gramarye Stamp". She
gets excited about the Gramaryes
again, but, when confronted
about where she got the stamp,
she took it from the envelope
that was sent to her, but she
didn't want to use the stamp to
send it back to the client. It
looks like they were trying to
butter her up. The Commemorative
Stamp will be updated in the
court record. Now talk about
"The client". Vera gets silent
quickly, only saying that she
can't talk about them. She
throws up two locks to protect
her charm. Time for some lock-
cracking.

VERA MISHAM'S PSYCHE-LOCK: THE
CLIENT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~ Vera seems to have
a lot of trust in the client
since they listened to her. They
even told her not to go outside
if she didn't want to. But if
she had to go outside for some
reason, she would use her charm
to protect herself from bad
people. Remember the table: it
had a bottle that looks very
similar to the bottle of nail
polish Kristoph gave us. Present
the nail polish to identify it
as her good luck charm. One lock
breaks, and Vera states that
cosmetics once was thought to
drive evil away. Now, who gave
Vera that polish? If you've been
following along, it should be
obvious: present Kristoph's
profile since he uses that same
nail polish. Unlock successful!

Talk to Vera about "The client"
again. She refuses to talk
anymore about Kristoph, but
that's OK: it's all we needed to
solidify our suspicions.
However, she does confess that
Kristoph wasn't like other
people: he's either an angel or
a devil, since she saw the
devil's face near him at some
point. Phoenix has to leave,
telling Drew to apologize to Zak
and promising Vera to see her
again. When returned to the
memory selection screen, select
the remaining past memory: Past
Memory #1, "Detention Center".

In this memory, Valant is pretty
peeved that he's still locked up
while the man who lost his badge
is still out in the open. But
he's optimistic: he's still got
his way of life set. Talk to
Valant about "The fateful
trial". Valant claims that,
since Zak disappeared, it was a
confession of guilt, and now
Valant will inherit the rights
to Magnifi's magic. He's
ecstatic about reaping the
benefits it seems. Too bad for
him that he doesn't grab up the
rights after all. Next, talk to
him about "Blackmail". Phoenix
notes that the cloud of
suspicion surrounding Valant
hasn't cleared yet: after all,
he got a letter from Magnifi
too. Valant is tired of talking
about the murder, so Phoenix
instead changes the subject,
asking what Magnifi held over
their heads. Valant rebuffs
Phoenix, and even throws up a
few locks for good measure. Time
to take him on.

VALANT GRAMARYE'S PSYCHE-LOCK:
THE TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE ~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Phoenix admits
that he's having a hard time
believing that Magnifi, who was
already going to die, asked his
own students to murder him, but
Valant is still jovial, saying
that his mentor was fond of
dramatic moves... not to mention
dramatic finales. But what would
be so powerful as to move
someone to kill someone else?
The answer lies in the
performances: the flashier an
act is, the better it is
recieved. But usually, that
involves taking incredible
risks. Valant asks Phoenix to
present his proof, so present
the Stage Pistol: it can fire
live rounds and it was used for
one of their acts! Upon Phoenix
mentioning the notion of an
accident, Valant slightly
cracks, breaking one lock.
Phoenix asks Valant if they
stopped doing the act due to the
risks involved. The magician
says it's only natural, but
Phoenix has other ideas. Maybe
they didn't cancel it due to the
risk that someone could get
hurt: maybe they stopped because
someone already got hurt! To
prove it, present Trucy's
Locket: Thalassa could have been
the one they had shot! As
another lock breaks, Valant
refutes Phoenix's allegations,
asking why they would have shot
Thalassa on stage. Present the
Commemorative Stamp as proof:
she was not only Zak's wife, she
was also their assistant on
stage! One lock now remains.
Valant however, has one of his
own tricks up his sleeve: if
Thalassa had been shot, then
Magnifi covered the incident up,
making him a co-conspirator! Why
would he blackmail his disciples
over this incident? Choose to
prove it "With a person" and
present Thalassa's profile:
according to Brushel, Thalassa
was Magnifi's only daughter, and
he would have felt a lot of
grief after her passing... so
much so that he decided to
blackmail his students as
punishment! Unlock successful!

Talk to Valant about "Blackmail"
again. He continues to insist
that there's no proof that
Thalassa died, but Phoenix isn't
buying any of it. Valant then
admits that he was involved in
quite a situation: because they
all lived together in a Troupe,
it was like a world unto itself.
He admits it was an accident.
They were practicing the shoot-
out, but put a new twist into
the routine. However, a bullet
hit Thalassa instead of passing
by her. To this day, neither Zak
or Valant knew whose bullet did
her in. In fact, this is only a
small part of the darkness that
occurs behind the scenes. Talk
to Valant about "The Darkness".
He says that, in order for Zak
and Valant to take over from
Magnifi, Thalassa had become an
unwilling sacrifice. Then, quite
suddenly, he denounces Magnifi's
actions regarding the accident,
calling them cowardly. He even
had the gall to blackmail his
disciples into doing whatever he
wanted! Trucy, however, was
never told about the truth,
which would have caused her
further grief. Valant then
reveals that a little after the
accident, a reporter came by to
investigate the incident.
Valant, however, can't remember
the guy's name. But this
reporter managed to get all
buddy-buddy with Zak, which
earned him some emnity from the
yellow-clad magician. About the
only thing Valant can remember
about the reporter is that he
had a strong scent of mint
hovering around him. Sound like
someone familiar? When the last
past memory is complete, the
final two present memories will
be unlocked. Enter Present
Memory #3: "Drew Studio".

It's been sometime after court
that day as Phoenix encounters
Brushel at the scene of the
crime. Brushel is feeling a bit
down since he didn't uncover
everything just a bit sooner. In
fact, he's been on this case as
a favor to Zak. Phoenix asks
Brushel if he can question him,
and after an akward moment,
concedes. Talk to Brushel about
"Family of forgers". Phoenix has
to feel sorry for Drew and Vera:
neither of them deserved any of
this. Brushel thinks otherwise,
as they were still forging. In
fact, it was probably due to
that one piece of forged
evidence. Brushel reveals that,
on that night, Drew confessed
that he felt like he was being
watched: the same way that
Brushel's been feeling. Talk to
him about "Paranoia". Brushel
asks Phoenix to think about it:
how come the very night Zak re-
emerged from the shadows was the
same night he was murdered. He
even raises the possibility of
Phoenix being watched too. Next,
talk to Brushel about "Zak
Gramarye". Brushel actually met
Zak while he was investigating
Thalassa's accidental shooting.
In fact, Brushel was on close
speaking terms with Magnifi at
the time. He was even friends
with Thalassa. When the accident
happened, Magnifi kept his mouth
shut, so Brushel moved on to Zak
for a one-on-one interview. At
that time, Magnifi had already
been blackmailing his students,
as Brushel reckons. But, during
that interview, Brushel really
hit it off with Zak, and they
became friends. Next, talk about
"Valant Gramarye". Brushel notes
with irony that, with Zak gone,
Valant STILL can't perform
Magnifi's tricks, due to the
fact that Zak passed the rights
down to Trucy. Poor Valant,
losing to his partner in both
business and love... wait. LOVE?
Brushel hypothesises that,
though Thalassa was married to
Zak, Valant secretly loved her.
And right in the middle was
Trucy.

Present Trucy's Locket to
Brushel. He'd recognize
Magnifi's daughter from
anywhere. Now talk to Brushel
about "Thalassa". Brushel
reveals that Thalassa's marriage
to Zak was only her second one:
the first was to another
performer, but that lasted for
only a year, and it ended when
he died on stage during an
accident. But, back to the topic
at hand, Brushel shows Phoenix a
picture of Thalassa he's been
carrying around. In the picture,
she's wearing two bracelets that
look quite similar to Apollo's
one bracelet. Brushel's also met
Trucy, saying that she was
lucky, unlike the other one,
who's probably an orphan now.
Phoenix is confused, so Brushel
spells it out for him: Trucy
wasn't Thalassa's only child! He
reveals that she had another kid
with her first husband, but he
has no idea where they are now.
If you've been putting the
pieces together, you probably
have a good idea where this is
going. Brushel lets Phoenix
borrow his photo. Thalassa's
Portrait will be added to the
court record. Brushel wonders
what Magnifi would think of all
this, given that Trucy's got his
power. He has no idea what makes
it work, and no one else will
know either, now that Zak is
dead. I don't think that he's
quite dead yet: we still need to
pry open his secret, so, when
returned to the memory selection
screen, enter Present Memory #1
once more, and initiate the
unlocking process.

ZAK GRAMARYE'S PSYCHE-LOCK: THE
GRAMARYE SECRET ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Phoenix admits that he still
doesn't understand Trucy's
power, and asks Zak to help out.
Zak is non-commital, saying that
he doesn't have this power.
Phoenix raises the possibility
of Thalassa handing the power
down to Trucy, but Zak won't
talk. To prove why he won't talk
anymore about her, present
either the Commemorative Stamp
or the Stage Pistol: he still
feels guilty over possibly
killing her. He cracks one lock
under pressure. He loved
Thalassa's eyes, and yet he was
scared of them, as he knew that
they could see right through
him. Now the only one left with
the power is Trucy, or so goes
the belief. But Phoenix may know
who else might have inherited
Magnifi's power. Present
Apollo's profile to name him as
the other inheritor (though
Phoenix doesn't know his name at
the time). Zak shrugs it off,
saying that there's no proof
that Apollo's related by blood.
Present Thalassa's Portait: in
it, she's wearing bracelets of
the exact same type as Thalassa
is wearing! Zak finally puts it
together: Apollo is Thalassa's
first child, and recieved his
bracelet from his mother, which
would make Apollo and Trucy
brother and sister! Unlock
successful!

Talk about "The Gramarye
Secret". Even Zak doesn't know
where the power comes from. But
he knows for a fact that this
power is passed down the
Gramarye family line. The fact
that he even knows about this
power at all is due to Thalassa.
He goes on to explain that this
power reacts to tension: if
someone became tense in front of
her, then she'd know that they
were nervous. But here's the
strange part: even she wouldn't
know that she was subconciously
detecting this tension without
the aid of her bracelets. Zak
finally decides to reveal
everything he knows about the
power. Talk about "Trucy and
Apollo". Chances are that they
are completely unaware of their
relationship as brother and
sister. Zak intends to disappear
without telling them, but
Phoenix promises him that he'll
tell them eventually. Next, talk
about "The bracelets". Zak
explains that the bracelets are
made out of a special type of
alloy that grows and shrinks
when in response to the warmth
of a person's body: temperature-
sensitive, in other words. In
fact, they can shrink or grow to
be a perfect fit for the
wearer's wrist. It's the perfect
tool for the Gramarye ability,
since, when they sense tension,
they themselves become tense,
and their muscles minutely
contract. Unless a user wears
one of these bracelets, they
can't detect these contractions.
From there, all they have to do
is look very hard.

Finally, talk about "Eyesight".
Zak explains that the Gramaryes'
eyesight is an enhanced verson
of kinetic vision: the ability
to see moving objects with full
clarity. The downside is that
it's difficult to know when to
focus. That's where another
facet of the bracelets come in:
when the Gramaryes detect the
tension in the audience, thanks
to the bracelets, that's their
cue to focus. The only reason
Trucy's been able to tell
whether or not someone's
bluffing is because the timing
is so elementary, she does it
without thinking. After
discussing these topics, Zak
finally decides to tell the
whole truth about the night
Magnifi died. The whole ordeal
was actually a test: as told by
Magnifi to Zak all those years
ago, the purpose of the test was
to find a worthy successor to
his art. When Zak shot the
clown, he passed the test and
Magnifi passed the tricks down
to him. If Zak had left without
shooting anything, Valant would
have his chance. However, if Zak
had shot Magnifi, then neither
Zak nor Valant would inherit the
right to perform the magic.
Phoenix, grateful, informs Zak
of his partner's predicament:
ever since the trial, public
opinion has taken a slow, but
sharp turn for the worse for
him, saying that Zak only left
to protect Valant from a murder
charge. Zak, aghast, decides
that there's one more thing he
needs to do before he vanishes
again. The last thing Zak left
behind besides a greater
explanation and his will is a
confession note, claiming that
he killed his mentor, and that
his partner was innocent. Zak's
Confession will be added to the
court record. When given the
chance, enter the last Present
Memory, "Sunshine Coliseum".

Valant is rather suprised to see
Phoenix again, and, though he
doesn't want to, he decides to
talk with him again for old
time's sake. Talk to Valant
about "Magnifi Gramarye". Valant
is angered that everyone thinks
he murdered his mentor, but
Phoenix supposes that it's
because Valant never made it
clear what he was up to that
night. In fact, that's why
Phoenix is here today: to
finally learn the truth behind
Magnifi's death. As if on cue,
Valant throws up 2 locks. Time
to learn the truth at last.

VALANT GRAMARYE'S PSYCHE-LOCK:
MAGNIFI'S DEATH ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valant believes that he's in the
clear, now that Zak is legally
(and literally) dead. Well,
let's just see how much he
squirms when he learns that his
dreams have been dashed. Present
the Transferral of Rights:
before Zak died, he passed the
rights he had inherited from
Magnifi on to Trucy, not Valant.
In shock, Valant breaks his
first lock. He's infuriated that
he's been thwarted by a dead
man, but Phoenix has a little
something to make his day:
present Zak's Confession.
Instead of getting glad,
however, Valant gets the shock
of his life! Unlock successful!

Talk to Valant about "Magnifi
Gramarye" again. Valant knows
that this confession is a lie as
well. Phoenix finally thinks
he's got the murderer cornered,
but Valant continues to insist
that he had shot no one! Phoenix
is stumped, but Valant offers up
one last possibility: the
murderer was... the victim
himself! Valant is claiming that
Magnifi commited suicide! Talk
to Valant about "Suicide". Even
Phoenix is in awe, as he never
even considered the possibility.
When Valant went to fulfill his
mentor's orders, Magnifi was
still alive. When Valant made to
leave after failing to shoot
him, Magnifi called him back,
and told him all about the test
and the rights. Phoenix has
really no choice but to
apologize to Valant. The
magician, however, claims that
he does not deserve forgiveness,
because he had commited a crime
that, in a way, was worse than
murder. Now talk about "Valant's
"Crime"". Valant had known all
along that two letters had been
sent, but he had no idea that
the test involved the right to
perform Magnifi's magic. Valant
had planned from the very outset
to murder Magnifi and frame Zak
for the crime. He had even
managed to grab a sample of
Magnifi's medication beforehand.
But when the moment came, Valant
found that he couldn't shoot his
mentor. Magnifi called Valant
back as he was leaving, and
asked that Valant do all in his
power to support Zak. As Valant
left the room in shock,
realizing that his career was
over, he heard that fateful
gunshot signifying Magnifi's
suicide. Feeling betrayed,
Valant decided to carry out his
plan to frame Zak for a crime
that he never commited. At the
end of his tale, Valant thanks
Phoenix for the talk, as now he
plans to disappear back
underground. Before he leaves,
however, he drops a hint that
"she" might still be alive.
There's one more thing we need
to do before the "game" ends,
and that's to look one more time
in Kristoph's cell. Head there
now.

As Phoenix comes in, the guard
informs him that Kristoph is
busy. In a very sly move,
Phoenix asks the guard to check
up on his business. Examine the
yellow envelope on the table.
It's definitely the same one
Brushel mentioned during the
trial. When given the chance,
spray around the stamp to reveal
the atroquinine poisoning.
Phoenix the opens the envelope
to reveal Drew Misham's last
letter:

"The interview request came,
like you said it would, and
they're looking into the case.
I swear on my life, I won't
tell them about you.
So please, release the "spell"
you've put on my daughter.
I'll write later with a report.

  Drew Misham"

The Letter from Misham will be
added to the court record, but
before Phoenix can make his
getaway, Kristoph shows up, and
asks Phoenix to give the letter
back. Having no choice, Phoenix
obliges. Kristoph cryptically
tells Phoenix that Vera will die
soon, unaware that the entire
encounter has been caught on
tape. Now that the "game" has
been won, it's time to finish
the trial. Save your game.

:PRESENT DAY " DAY 3 " TRIAL:

Before we can enter the
courtroom, Phoenix tells us to
decide on Vera's verdict. Press
the A button or touch the screen
to start the endgame.

Court begins without Vera,
because if she dies, then the
trial is cancelled, and, as
Klavier notes, nothing but grief
can come from an incomplete
trial. Klavier then gives out
his opening statement: the very
fact that Vera's poisoned
herself with the same substance
that killed her father indicates
her guilt, but Apollo objects
(having been told the entire
story last night), claiming that
Vera was the victim, not the
killer. Klavier, in response,
asks Apollo how the poisoning
was carried out and who did it
to her. Choose to "Show "how"",
and present the nail polish:
Vera has quite a nervous habit
of biting her nails, so what
better way to poison her than to
spike a bottle of nail polish?
Klavier seems to be dumbstruck,
as if he's seen a bottle like
that before. The judge requests
that Vera's nails be checked for
residue and asks Apollo who
poisoned her. Present Kristoph's
profile: being the client that
requested that forgery all those
years ago, he'd have a prime
motive for silencing Vera.
Klavier objects, pointing out
the obvious fact that Kristoph
in jail, but Apollo trounces
that notion by saying that
Kristoph could have poisoned
that nail polish well before he
was found guilty of murder.
Klavier admits that he has no
choice but to summon Kristoph
from jail as a special witness,
and the judge agrees.

Kristoph is back on the stand,
and he's still as intimidating
as ever. He even asks why he's
here in the first place. Klavier
explains that his former pupil
is once again accusing him of
murder. The judge asks Kristoph
to testify about the poisoning.

KRISTOPH GAVIN'S (AND THE GAME'S
FINAL!) TESTIMONY: POISONING
VERA
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-Owning the same nail polish doe

-I have been in solitary confine
her?

-Her father died of the same poi
clear.

-The prosecution's case holds. S
to poison herself.

-Surely, you aren't going to sug
father, too?

Use the bracelet on Kristoph's
last statement, the one about
Kristoph's supposed joke of
poisoning Drew as well, and move
your focus to the hand holding
up the glasses: when you see a
skull in his hand, which is VERY
creepy, press percive. Apollo
immediately accuses Kristoph of
murdering Drew as well, but
Kristoph shrugs it off,
suggesting that Drew wasn't the
type of person to wear nail
polish. However, just because
Drew didn't use the nail polish
doesn't mean that he wasn't
poisoned by Kristoph. Present
the Commemorative Stamp as
proof: as Phoenix, we found
traces of poison on this stamp,
and this stamp was in Kristoph's
cell!

After the background fades back
in, Kristoph begins his
counterattack, claiming that
Drew had never intended to use
that stamp, thus if he did use
it, it would have been a mere
coincidence. Apollo falls
silent, but Klavier's seen right
through his brother's bluff: the
defense's case was that Drew
Misham used a poisoned stamp.
There was nothing about the
murder not being a coincidence
in that claim, so there's
nothing wrong with Drew dying by
chance! Kristoph changes gears
and decides to talk about
motive: he had no reason to kill
the Mishams at all! Apollo
realizes that, since Kristoph
would have mentioned the motive
right off the bat, there must be
something there that hurts
Kristoph's innocence! Present
the Notebook Page as proof of a
motive: remember, Kristoph had
this piece of evidence forged
for Zak's trial seven years ago
by the Mishams. He'd want to do
anything and everything to cover
his tracks. Even commit murder.
Klavier objects, claiming that
Phoenix had forged that piece of
evidence to win the trial.
Apollo then reveals that Phoenix
had only taken the case the
night before the trial, thus,
he'd have no time to have had
anything forged! Apollo then
claims that Kristoph had been
Zak's former attorney! Kristoph
denies it, and adds that Apollo
can't prove his claim that he
was Zak's previous attorney
since council is only logged in
the night before the trial.
Klavier then asks Apollo to
prove that Kristoph was involved
in the forgery, and even pleads
with him. With a GIGANTIC
penalty at stake, present the
Letter from Misham. Kristoph
objects right off the bat,
claiming that the letter Apollo
just produced it a forgery of
the real letter in the cell.
Apollo disagrees, informing the
court that the letter in his
hands now is a reproduction of
the real letter, not a forgery:
a subtle distinction, but a
distinction nonetheless.
Unfortunately, Kristoph
convinces the judge that the
reproduction is inadmissable
evidence. Now, since there's
nothing to do but watch, look on
as Klavier and Apollo continue
to tear into Kristoph, and watch
Kristoph go completely berzerk
as he learns about the Jurist
System! At the end, make sure
you select "Innocent", or else
you'll get a game over. Enjoy
the rest of the story!

Conclusion
================================

I hope that you enjoyed the game
as much as I did! I like to read
aloud during these games, but it
seems as though I strained my
voice during my voicethroughs.
Ah well. I STRONGLY urge you to
buy the game so that we may have
an opportunity to play the
second Apollo Justice when it's
finished!

"OBJECTION!"
