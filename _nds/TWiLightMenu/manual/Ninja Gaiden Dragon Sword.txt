What it do, my babies? I'm guessing that a bunch of you playing Ninja 
Gaiden DS have NEVER played the console versions. That's okay, there's 
no need to be a Master Ninja player to play the DS version. All it 
takes is some patience and a little bit of help from my walkthrough to 
get through it all. This walkthrough below applies for all four 
difficulties, so read up!


Sharpen up those swords, it's time to PAR-TEE!

    +++   FIST OF THE DRAGON - GAMEPLAY ASPECTS & COMBO LIST   +++

               ________   __  __________  __   _____  __
              / ___/ _ | /  |/  / __/ _ \/ /  / _ \ \/ /

Most of these aspects are covered in the first level Tutorial, but if 
you were too lazy to remember them, here's the list:


--HARD ATTACKS:  MOVE STYLUS TOWARDS EACH ENEMY
To attack your enemies, simply move the Stylus towards each enemy and 
attack them by using a scratching motion with the Stylus. Ryu will 
start slicing in different directions.


--DOUBLE JUMP: SLIDE STYLUS UP TWICE
Unlike the console versions, Ryu can do a double jump in the DS 
version! Simply slide the Slide the Stylus up twice to do the jump.


--SHURIKENS: TAP STYLUS ON EACH ENEMY
To toss Shurikens at your enemies, tap the Stylus on any of the enemies 
(on the ground or while in mid-air) and Ryu will toss infinite amounts 
of Shuriken stars at them.


--THE IZUNA DROP: DOWN, UP, UP
The Izuna Drop is Ryu's most powerful move in his arsenal of attacks 
(aside from Ninpo) because it is always a guaranteed instant kill. When 
done successfully, Ryu launches the enemy, grabs them in mid-air, and 
does a mid-air pile driver. Use this move at every opportunity to "thin 
the herd" as they say.


--THE FLYING SWALLOW ATTACK: UP <-- OR --> (DIRECTIONAL)
To stop a large amount of enemies that are swarming against Ryu, jump 
up (or double jump) and then slide the Stylus horizontally to trigger 
the Flying Swallow attack. It does not kill enemies instantly but it 
can get you out of tough spots.


--DIVINE CICADA SLASH: UP, DOWN
This attack is Ryu's second most powerful and can also get you out of 
harm's way. Jump or double-jump up and then slide the Stylus down to 
trigger a downward strike.


--THE GLEAMING BLADE ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE: SLIDE STYLUS ALL OVER SCREEN
To perform the Ultimate Technique (also known as UT), point the Stylus 
on Ryu and move the Stylus in a left-to-right scratching fashion to 
make Ryu perform the Gleaming Blade. Hold the position and scratch the 
screen faster to power up the attack for bigger damage.


--NINPO ATTACK
On the upper left-hand side of the screen is a circular Sanskrit 
symbol. Tap the Stylus on it to activate the Ninpo screen. When the 
screen appears, trace the kanji letter onscreen (successfully) to begin 
the attack. All Ninpo attacks allow Ryu to direct the attack in 
multiple directions while activated, so use the Stylus to move the 
attacks in various directions of the enemy.


--BLOCK: ANY FACE BUTTON
Ah yes, the main essential move in Ryu's large arsenal. Unlike other 
games like Devil May Cry 4 where you have white-haired demon-slaying 
doofuses trying to perform lots of combos without the use of a Block 
button, using the Block button in Ninja Gaiden is ESSENTIAL in order to 
survive the onslaught of enemies. 


--THE REVERSE WIND: TAP SCREEN WHILE BLOCKING
Evasion is a TOP priority in addition to blocking. When fighting off 
enemies, hold the face buttons on the DS to get Ryu into a defensive 
stance. While he's in a defensive stance, tap the screen and he will 
use a roll move. Use this move to avoid an enemy that has a block 
breaker attack.


--CONTINUOUS FLYING BIRD FLIP: UP (SLIDE CONTINUOUSLY)
To reach higher elevations of certain areas, slide the Stylus upwards 
continuously until Ryu reaches the top.


--THE HEALTH RESORE SYSTEM
The Health Restore System is simple as it looks. When Ryu loses health 
during a battle, his blue health bar will decrease and a gray bar will 
show underneath it. After clearing the battle, Ryu's health will 
automatically be restored up to the point where the gray bar is shown.


--THE NINTENDO DS MIC
The Mic actually has a couple of uses in the game! There are a few 
instances where you need to SCREAM or BLOW into the Mic to find hidden 
treasures or solve puzzles within the game.


--THE PURPLE BIRD
In certain secret (and some not-so-secret) areas of the game, Ryu will 
hear a high-pitched squeal in the room that he is currently in. Move 
Ryu to a certain area of the room and SCREAM into the Mic to unleash 
the Purple Bird. Toss a Shuriken at the bird to obtain a WOOD AMULET. 
In some cases, the bird can only be found by tossing a Shuriken at an 
object in the room.

                    +++   NINPO AND TECHNIQUES   +++


--THE ART OF INFERNO
This scroll can be used to destroy webbed gateways. It's the weakest 
Ninpo of the bunch.

--THE ART OF THE INAZUMA
This lightning-based scroll enables Ryu to destroy boulders and 
individual enemies.

--THE ART OF THE HURRICANE
This scroll is Ryu's most useful because the Hurricane attack can 
target multiple enemies at once. It also can be used to extinguish or 
activate certain things.

--THE ART OF THE FIRE WHEELS
This scroll is mostly useful when battling Ghost Fish. Other than that, 
only purchase it from Muramasa if you really need to.

--THE ART OF DIVINE LIFE
This scroll enables Ryu to restore his health in emergency situations.

--THE ART OF THE ICE STORM
This scroll summons ice stalactites and can extinguish flames. This is 
the second weakest Ninpo of the bunch

--THE ART OF THE PIERCING VOID
This scroll enables Ryu to summon multiple meteors. Although quite 
powerful, the attacks are only limited to one enemy per meteor.


----------------------------

--THE IZUNA DROP
This scroll will be in Ryu's inventory from the get-go. Abuse this 
powerful attack at every chance you get.

--THE FLOCK OF SWALLOWS
This scroll will allow Ryu to use multiple Flying Swallow attacks on 
various enemies. It won't work for some enemies but is killer against 
Beetles and Wasp Fiends.

--COUNTER ATTACK
I absolutely found NO use for this scroll. Since every enemy's attacks 
break Ryu's guard, there's really no way to counter.

----------------------------


--JEWEL OF THE SPIRIT SMITH
This item will increase the Dragon Sword's damage power. There a total 
of four upgrades to purchase from Muramasa.

--LIVES OF THE THOUSAND GODS
These babies increase Ryu's health bar. There are also a total of four 
of these to purchase from Muramasa.


++MURAMASA NOTE:
In Master Ninja Mode, the health and weapon upgrades will increase by 
TWICE the price from Normal and Head Ninja Mode. MONEY GRUBBING WHORE!

++MASTER KUNOICHI NOTE:
If you are playing Master Kunoichi Mode, Rin will not have the Izuna 
Drop in her inventory. It is purchasable from Muramasa in Chapter 9 for 
a whopping 20,000 Essence.

There are various enemies in the game and I will explain the best way 
to defeat each one. Sure, you might think that you can just hack and 
slash away at them with no problems...but this ain't Devil May Cry 4, 
so it doesn't really work that easily.

Most of the baddies in the game originally appeared in the Xbox/PS3 
versions except where noted with an asterisk (**).


CLAW NINJA**
ARCHER NINJA**
RED NINJA**
PHANTOM WARLOCK**
ZOMBIE NINJA
All these enemies are victim to the Izuna Drop. Evade their attacks and 
then roll in with the Izuna Drop for an instant kill. As for the Zombie 
Ninja, you'll need to be super evasive because they are very grabby.


WEREWOLF**
ARCHER/AXE-WIELDING ZOMBIE
These enemies are very touchy-feely (literally) and can be a bit 
difficult to kill. The Werewolves like to use hard pounce attacks and 
are aggressive in their combos. The axe-wielding zombies are also 
aggressive like the wolves. Usually, the best way to kill them is to 
use an Ultimate Technique after a combo. As for the archer Zombie, a 
couple of arrows or an Izuna Drop will kill it.


BATS
FIRE BATS
CYCLOP EYEBALL** 
Shurikens in the face. 'Nuff said.


PINK SHADOW FIEND
ONE-EYED PINCER FIEND
BLACK KIYATT
RED KIYATT**
All these baddies are easy to kill with Izuna Drops, but you have to be 
defensive before initiating the attack. The Pincers and Kiyatts like to 
use cheap grab moves, so stay evasive!


LARGE DUNG BEETLES
WASP FIENDS
These baddies are victims to the Flying Swallow attack. Once Ryu 
purchases the Flock Of Swallows attack scroll, forget about it!


KNIGHTMARE
MACE-WIELDING OGRE
GARGOYLE**
These are the heavyweight enemies that require more juice to kill. 
Since you cannot use Izuna Drops on these guys, stick to using the 
Flock Of Swallows attack in order to damage them.

                      +++   FIEND CHALLENGES   +++


After Ryu completes each chapter, he CANNOT revisit that area anymore. 
However, when you go back to Stone Circle Cove and re-enter the portal 
for that particular level, Ryu will be transported to a special battle 
arena. Enemies will start spawning and Ryu cannot leave until every 
enemy is dead and gone. 

This is known as a Fiend Challenge. Each challenge is OPTIONAL after 
completing each mission up to Chapter 11. Each Fiend Challenge usually 
consists of 100-150 enemies per arena (more on harder difficulties) and 
the prize for winning each challenge is a WOOD AMULET. The complete 
list of enemies and prizes per arena is listed below:


++DIFFICULTY NOTE: The enemies that appear in each arena are the same 
for all four difficulties.

Even though this is only a DS game, there is still a bunch of things 
you need to know when playing. As you replay the game, utilize these 
tactics to get the upper advantage in combat.


--ABUSE YOUR POWERFUL ATTACKS
Even though Ryu has a large array of attacks, its much better to just 
spam his powerful moves instead. When fighting enemies, stay in a 
defensive position and then utilize the Izuna Drop on each of them for 
an instant kill.

--USE THE ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE
After you eliminate a couple of enemies, charge up for a UT and quickly 
unleash it on the next set of spawning enemies. Also, in some cases, 
pre-charge for a UT when entering certain rooms so that you can kill 
whatever spawns before they attack. Keep unleashing non-stop UT's on 
everyone until the room is cleared.

--RESERVE NINPO FOR LAST MINUTE ATTACKS
It's as easy as it sounds. Avoid using Ninpo for most of the chapters 
and only use it when ABSOLUTELY necessary. 

--UPGRADE YOUR WEAPON & HEALTH AT EVERY CHANCE
As soon as Muramasa finally opens up his Inventory to you (that's what 
she said), purchase the essential items like a JEWEL OF THE SPIRIT 
SMITH and a LIVES OF THE THOUSAND GODS. The sooner you can upgrade your 
health and weapons, the better!

--BE DEFENSIVE BUT EVASIVE
Don't just rush into battle thinking you can just hack and slash away 
at your enemies like it was a Devil May Cry game! When a battle starts, 
get into a defensive stance and use the Reverse Wind to roll around. 
After an enemy attacks, rush in and use an Izuna Drop and then repeat. 
This is especially crucial in Master Ninja Mode.

**BOSS NOTE:
Most of the bosses in the game do not have any names (except the 
reappearing ones from the Xbox version), so I'll be using a bunch of 
silly made-up names in their place...until I find out their real names.

Before the chapter begins, a practice battle between Momiji and Ryu 
will take place. Momiji cannot damage Ryu, so just stay defensive and 
evasive. After a minute, the battle ends and the chapter will begin.

The level begins with a Tutorial with that naughty bad girl Momiji. 
Follow the onscreen directions (as noted below) to complete the level:


--TOUCH AND HOLD THE STYLUS TO THE TOUCH SCREEN TO RUN IN THE DESIRED 
DIRECTION

--SLIDE THE STYLUS UPWARDS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN TO JUMP

--TAP AN ENEMY TO ATTACK WITH SHURIKEN

--HOLD DOWN ANY BUTTON TO BLOCK ENEMY ATTACKS

--TOUCH THE DRAGON STATUE TO REPLENISH ALL HEALTH AND KI


After you reach the SAVE STATUE, take the cavern route going into the 
mountain. Follow the cavern path to the next area.


--TAP WHILE BLOCKING TO DODGE (REVERSE WIND)

--SLIDE THE STYLUS UPWARDS REPEATEDLY TO SCALE CLIFFS

When you reach the second cliff, use a Continuous Bird Flip to reach 
the top. SAVE your game and then exit to the left side.


--WHILE JUMPING, SLIDE THE STYLUS HORIZONTALLY TO PERFORM THE FLYING 
SWALLOW TECHNIQUE


Once you're done misbehaving with Momiji (aaaawwww yeah!), its boss 
battle time, boys and girls!

Look at the Pokemon rip-off! The boss only has three attacks:

--RUSH ATTACK
--DRAGON CHOMP
--FIRE BREATH

Use the Reverse Wind to evade the boss's rush attack and use the Flying 
Swallow when the coast is clear. Attack the boss from the side so that 
he doesn't hit you up close. Repeat as much as you can!

Technically, Momiji is not supposed to win this battle but you can 
still give it your best try. It's the same concept as the Chapter 2 
Doku battle in Ninja Gaiden Sigma. If you defeat this boss, you get a 
special prize. If you lose, the story continues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


++AREA: OPEN RANGE 1

The mission begins with a big bang! Test out Ryu's arsenal of attacks 
on the Claw Ninjas. Remember to stay evasive and keep the pain raining 
down on the baddies. 

When the battle starts, Ryu can utilize the Flying Swallow and the 
infamous Izuna Drop, so don't be afraid to use them! Eliminate the 
enemies and enter the next area.


++AREA: OPEN RANGE 2

Claw and Archer Ninjas will appear here. Use double-jumps and toss 
Shurikens at the Archers in mid-air to eliminate them first. When the 
Archers are gone, deal with the Claw Ninjas as usual.

When the area is cleared, exit out and SAVE your game near the webbed 
gate. Make your way up the stairs and get ready to defend an innocent 
bystander. 


++AREA: HAYABUSA GRAVEYARD

Approach the graveyard and start slashing at the Claw Ninjas that 
appear. When the first wave is done, approach the old man to find out 
that it is Muramasa, the money-grubbing whore from the original Xbox 
game! Talk to him to receive Ryu's first Ninpo.

After receiving the Ninpo scroll, more Ninjas will appear. You do NOT 
need to activate Ninpo to defeat them, but use it if you want to see 
how the Ninpo attack works. Once that's done, go back downstairs to the 
webbed gate.


--OBJECTIVE: USE NINPO TO OPEN THE GATE

Activate Ninpo to break open the webbed gate near the Open Range. From 
there, enter through to the Central Bridge.


++AREA: CENTRAL BRIDGE

Approach the large gate at the other end. Eliminate the Archers with 
Shurikens first and then get rid of the rest of the other baddies to 
clear the area. Enter the large red gate.


++AREA: OUTER/INNER HOUSE

Zip past the two villagers and continue into the house to encounter a 
large gaggle of baddies. Inside the house will be a great place to rack 
up an insane amount of combos.

After defeating a bunch of Claw and Archer ninjas, a set of Red Ninjas 
will appear here to swarm you. Stay mobile so that they don't grab you 
and use the Izuna Drop on all of them to clear the area. Grab the 
OBABA'S SECRET MESSAGE item from the floor.


++AREA: CASTLE GATES

Exit the house and then approach the SAVE POINT and SAVE your game. Now 
continue up the hill to meet some baddies. Kill the approaching Claw 
Ninja and then use Shurikens on the Archers above. 

Continue up the hill while dodging large boulders until you reach the 
top. Eliminate the Red Ninjas and then enter the Castle Entrance. SAVE 
your game and get ready to face off against that Pokemon boss!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Just before the boss battle begins, you'll face off against a non-stop 
shmgeggy of various ninja enemies. Eliminate them all with your 
hardcore skills to trigger the boss battle.

The battle with the boss won't be as difficult as it was with Momiji. 
Stay evasive of the boss's attacks and AVOID attacking him from up 
front. Most of the time, he will smack you with his wings when you try 
an attack from up close.

Evade to the boss's left or right side and use Divine Cicada Slashes 
from behind. Evade and then repeat. When the boss starts flapping his 
wings and starts flying in mid-air, go ahead and use the Flying Swallow 
on him to knock him down.

Continue this easy assault and you should be able to defeat the boss 
without having to use that pesky Ninpo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
       

++AREA: FOREST OF SHADOWS

NINJA PARTY TIME! After the cutscenes end, bust out some moves on the 
Ninjas that appear. Eliminate the Archers with mid-air Shurikens and 
then eliminate the rest. When the coast is clear, enter into the 
caverns. Head on through and then SAVE your game at the next area.

Use the Inferno Ninpo on the webbed gateway to open it up. From there, 
keep heading east and then use the Bird Flip to the top of the cavern.


++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

--OBJECTIVE: FIND MURAMASA

In the area where you meet Genjiro, there is a bullseye target on the 
lower left side of the area. Do you see it? Toss Shurikens at it to 
unleash some Blue Essence. Continue up the village and head to Central 
Bridge to find Muramasa sleeping.


--OBJECTIVE: WAKE UP THAT OLD FOOL

Awww, are you having a difficult time figuring out what to do in this 
part? Don't worry, that's makes two of us. To wake up Muramasa, SCREAM 
into the Nintendo DS MIC and he'll flip over and wake up. SIMPLE.

Talk with Muramasa and he'll lend you the ART OF THE INAZUMA Ninpo 
Scroll. If you have lots of cash-eesh in your pocket, go ahead and 
purchase some upgrades from the old fart.

Once that's done, it's time to do some EXPLORING!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--OPTIONAL OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #42

I know you wanna find some Secrets! Go back to the other side of the 
village and jump back into the well to the caverns. Jump into the next 
cavern near the SAVE POINT and then turn left.

Make another left turn to the next cavern and jump down again. From 
there, go ALL the way to the last cavern into an empty room with a 
high-pitched shriek coming from somewhere.

Scream into the Nintendo DS MIC to reveal a Purple Bird. Be careful, 
though, because the bird is mighty strong! Toss Shurikens at it to kill 
it and it will reveal a special prize: WOOD AMULET #42! Yay!


--OPTIONAL OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #40

To find Wood Amulet #40, you'll need to make your way out of the cave 
and go back to the waterfall area where Ryu and Momiji were training. 
Traverse through the caverns and make your way back to that waterfall 
area to hear a high-pitched squeal.

Move Ryu towards the large waterfall and enter inside to a secret 
cavern with a boulder blocking the way. Use the Inazuma Ninpo to 
destroy the boulder and then enter to a secret room.

Get rid of the Purple Bird to obtain Wood Amulet #40! YAY! Once you're 
done with all this fun exploration, go BACK to Hayabusa Village and 
continue the mission.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


++AREA: CENTRAL BRIDGE

--OBJECTIVE: DESTROY THE BOULDER AT THE GRAVEYARD

If you decide to not find the Wood Amulets, then just make your way up 
the hill and past the graveyard. Approach the large boulder at the end 
of the path and destroy it with an Inazuma Ninpo to reveal a portal. 
Enter the portal to return to a familiar place.


++AREA: MONASTERY GATES

If you've played the original Xbox version, this place will be VERY 
familiar to you. A bunch of Pink Shadow Fiends and Cyclops Eyeballs 
will appear here. Eliminate the Eyeball first by using mid-air 
Shurikens on it while its eye is open.

Once all the Eyeballs are gone, focus on using lots of Izuna Drops on 
the Pink Fiends until the area is cleared. From there, enter the 
Monastery Gates to encounter some more fiends. Kill the fiends and then 
enter inside the Monastery. 


++AREA: MONASTERY

--OBJECTIVE: REACH THE SECOND FLOOR AND OPEN THE ALTAR GATES

Approach the SAVE POINT on the right side and then enter the doorway 
into the Archives Room (kill the baddies inside the hall).


++AREA: ARCHIVES ROOM

Eliminate the Eyeballs first and then kill the remaining fiends with 
ease. When the room is cleared, ascend the stairs to the top. Go around 
the corner past the paintings and use a Bird Flip to the top of the 
Archives Room.

Eliminate the baddies and then exit back outside to the Monastery 
Balcony. SAVE your game and then go around the ledge to the other side 
and enter the next room to encounter a PUZZLE!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
              +++   PUZZLE: THREE RED LIGHTS PUZZLE   +++

Uh-oh! How do you solve this easy puzzle? Well, it works like this: 
there are three flashing lights. Every few seconds the light will turn 
RED and then BLUE. Toss a Shuriken at each light when the color turns 
BLUE to solve the puzzle! WHA-WHAT?!? That's all?!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #43

After the puzzle is solved, a high-pitched squeal will be heard inside 
the room. Toss a Shuriken at the large globe on the bottom right side 
to find the Purple Bird. Kill it to obtain WOOS AMULET #43! CHOW!!


Now exit out of the room and go back to the SAVE POINT to SAVE. Go back 
down to the Archives Room to encounter a brand new enemy: the Werewolf.

These guys are pretty aggressive but are still victims to the Izuna 
Drop. Use evasion rolls to avoid their pounce attacks and break their 
guard with the Izuna Drop. Eliminate the wolf pack to clear the area.

Continue out of the Archive (while defeating baddies) and exit back to 
the Monastery floor. SAVE your game and then approach the Altar.


++AREA: ALTAR AREA

Before you face off against the boss, you'll need to get your defensive 
skills in check. The next section will contain various enemies and you 
need to be on your guard! Approach the Altar to trigger an enemy 
challenge. A swarm of Pink fiends and Eyeballs will appear first.

Eliminate the bunch and then a large group of Werewolves will show up. 
Again, use defensive maneuvers and stay evasive from them! Use the 
Izuna Drop on the wolves to kill them faster. Once the room is cleared, 
its boss battle time!

The boss for the chapter is a large, one-eyed, legless beast similar to 
Yotunfrau from the original Xbox game (actually, it's the same exact 
boss). That doesn't mean he's gonna be an easy boss, though! The boss 
has several attacks:

--CONCRETE POUND
--3-HIT MELEE COMBO
--GRAB-AND-CHOMP
--ICICLE BREATH

All these attack are easy to evade. Just as long as you don't get 
careless, then this battle is easy to beat. When the battle begins, the 
boss will sit there for a couple of seconds. Approach him and get in a 
couple of hard combos. Once he starts moving, stay in front of him and 
bait him to attack you.

When he puts his arms back, he's going for the melee combo. Simply roll 
to the LEFT side and roll behind him. Attack him from behind until he 
flips over or retaliates with a Concrete Pound attack. If he flips 
over, stand in front of him again and let him attack. If he rears both 
arms, he's going for the grab and chomp. A good way to avoid this is to 
jump straight up (so misses grabbing you) or to jump backwards. When he 
misses the grab, perform another hard combo until he retaliates. 
Continue the assault to defeat him without that pesky Ninpo.


After the battle, grab the DARK DRAGONSTONE to complete the mission.


                             MISSION COMPLETED!

Enter the newly revealed portal to be transported to a brand new level.


++AREA: STONE CIRCLE COVE

Move forward and seek the SAVE STATUE nearby and SAVE your game! 
Explore the northeastern side of the cove and then come back near the 
SAVE POINT to reveal another portal. Take the portal to teleport to 
Hayabusa Village.


--OBJECTIVE: FIND MURAMASA AND SPEAK TO HIM

Speak with all the villagers if you want. Exit the castle gate area and 
make your way to the outer house to find Muramasa. Speak with him for 
some crucial new information.

After he's done blabbering about evil and crap, purchase a LIVES OF THE 
THOUSAND GODS from him if you haven't done so. From here, go back to 
the teleport stone and teleport back to Stone Circle Cove. 

When you arrive, another portal will be revealed. SAVE your game and 
then take the black portal to a new area.


++AREA: PERISTYLE PASSAGE

A set of Pink fiends and Eyeballs will appear. Eliminate the Eyeballs 
FIRST because they have a new lightning attack that can hamper your 
attacks! Eliminate the baddies to clear the area.


++AREA: UNDERGROUND PASSAGE A

You'll meet some Wasp Fiends (a bunch of Metroid-looking rip-offs) and 
some sharp spikes in this cavern. Avoid using the Flying Swallow on the 
Wasp Fiends and use Divine Cicada Slashes for instant kills.

When the coast is cleared of fiends, use well-timed Reverse Wind rolls 
to get past the protruding spikes. Do this for both caverns until you 
reach an open watery area.


++AREA: ELECTRIC WORM COVE

A whole gaggle of Large Dung Beetles will appear in this area. Be 
careful because these suckers are very grabby and like to jump onto 
you. To eliminate them all with ease, use nonstop Flying Swallow 
attacks (followed by an occasional UT) to clear the area. 


++AREA: SPIKED CAVERN #1 & 2

Use Divine Cicada Slashes on the Beetles from the small space you have 
until all of them are gone. From there, use Reverse Wind rolls to get 
past the protruding spikes. Repeat the tactic for the next cavern.
 
Approach the SAVE POINT and SAVE your game. Jump down to the chasm 
below to another hallway.


++AREA: SPIKED HALLWAY #1-3

Eyeballs will be on the other end of the hall to distract you. Ignore 
the Eyeballs and just use Reverse Wind Rolls to get through all three 
hallways to the exit and jump down.


++AREA: UNDERGROUND WATERWAY

--OBJECTIVE: FIND THE SECRET SAVE STATUE
--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #41

When you exit the cavern, you will see a webbed gateway to Ryu's left 
and a passage on the right side. Take the passage to Aquaducts 4B.

As soon as you enter, you will be swarmed with lots of Beetles. Use the 
Flying Swallow on them and then utilize nonstop UTs to kill even more 
of them. When the room is cleared, a secret doorway will open. Enter 
that doorway to find the SAVE POINT. SAVE your game and then go back to 
the previous room to hear high-pitched squeals.

Scream in the Nintendo DS MIC to reveal the Purple Bird. Toss Shurikens 
at it to reveal Wood Amulet #41! YAY! Now go back to the area with the 
webbed gateway and use an Inferno Ninpo to open it up and then enter.


++AREA: OUTER SANCTUARY

Enter the next area to find a large swarm of bats flying all over the 
place. Use the Flying Swallow to rid them all and then exit to the next 
hall. Eliminate the lone Eyeball and take care of the rest of the Pink 
fiends in the hall.

Once that's done, enter the next room to find the SAVE POINT near the 
Paz Zuu doorway. You cannot enter the doorway because you need to light 
up the eyes on the door to unlock it. Here's what you do:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


--OBJECTIVE: SOLVE THE UNDERGROUND SANCTUARY PUZZLE


            +++   PUZZLE: UNDERGROUND SANCTUARY PUZZLE   +++

Go back to the previous hall where you encountered the Pink Fiends. In 
the middle of the hall are two hard-to-see doorways on the left and 
right side of the hall. View the MAP on the adjacent screen to see what 
I mean. Jump through the one on the left side and enter the next room.

Eliminate the enemies in the room (or don't) and exit to the next area. 
Use a Bird Flip to the top of the room and exit on the left side. See 
that large burning torch across the chasm? There is another torch in 
front of it that needs to be lit. Equip the Inferno Ninpo and use it to 
light the torch. This will unlock the LEFT half of the Paz Zuu door.

DO NOT jump back down to the bottom of the room! Instead, take the 
other doorway to a hallway with lots of spikes. Roll through the spikes 
to find the SAVE POINT in the middle of the room.

SAVE your game and then roll to the opposite doorway to find the other 
unlit torch. Light it up and then jump back down to the Underground 
Sanctuary. SAVE your game at the newly opened doorway and then enter 
inside for a boss battle!

The bone-headed bird from the original Xbox game is back for ANOTHER 
stab at superstardom! This bird just never goes away! Paz has several 
attacks:

--HORIZONTAL LASER BEAM
--DIAGONAL LASER BEAM
--WINGSPAN ATTACK
--CHOMP-A-LUNCH

When it shoots its lasers from left to right (or vice versa), roll 
FORWARD or BACK to avoid getting hit. If it shoots its lasers from a 
straight angle, roll or move to the left or right of the laser to avoid 
getting hit by it. If you get too close, it will try to do a melee 
attack by either using its wings or the Wingspan attack.

The best way to defeat Paz is to use the Xbox Ass trick. Paz has a 
vulnerable spot on his body that you need to exploit: his ASS. Move 
underneath Paz (be sure to evade his attacks first before charging up) 
and use a fully charged Ultimate Technique under his ass to shave off a 
chunk of health.

Keep evading his attacks and stay underneath him while charging UT's. 
If he runs to the other side, follow him and then repeat the tactic. 
AVOID attacking him from up front or else he will grab and chomp you up 
and AVOID using the Flying Swallow. After a couple of hard UT's in the 
ass, Paz will keel over in pain. QUICKLY, and I mean QUICKLY, run up to 
his head and do another fully charged UT on it to shave off an even 
bigger amount of health. REPEAT!

The trick here is to be quick and evasive while charging for a UT under 
his boney ass. The more UT's that you can pull off, the better! Defeat 
Paz Zuu to obtain another DARK DRAGONSTONE.

++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

--OBJECTIVE: SAVE SAKURA
--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #38
--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #3

After Ryu gets the bad news, speak with Muramasa and purchase the FLOCK 
OF SWALLOWS Scroll. This will allow Ryu to do multiple Flying Swallow 
attacks on his enemies. But before you leave the village, it's time to 
find a Wood Amulet. There is a high-pitched shriek emanating in this 
area. Go to the northeastern side of the village (with the closed 
castle gates) and SCREAM into the Nintendo DS MIC to unleash the Purple 
Bird. Throw some Shuriken at it to reveal WOOD AMULET #38! YESSIR!!

The next WOOD AMULET is near the village well. When you reach the area, 
you'll hear the high-pitched squeal. To find the bird, toss a Shuriken 
at the bulls-eye target on the lower left side of the screen and the 
bird will fly out. Kill it to find WOOD AMULET #3! SUCK ON THAT!


Exit out of the village by using the well into the caverns. As you 
enter the next room, Claw Ninjas will appear, so get to it and slice 
them off with the new Flock of Swallows attack.

Once the room is cleared, exit out and jump down the chasm. You will 
encounter a few ninja friends that will give you directions as to where 
to go, so follow what they say to exit out of the caverns to the Forest 
of Shadows.


++AREA: FOREST OF SHADOWS

Exit the cavern and make a right turn to enter the forest arena area. 
You will be swarmed with Claw and Red ninjas, so bust out the Ultimate 
Technique and start slicing everyone up like it was nothing.

After the first wave of enemies are dead, you will be introduced to a 
new enemy: the Phantom Warlock. These guys appear and disappear while 
casting electric shockwaves underneath you. To defeat them, stay 
evasive and then attack when they appear. Utilize the Gleaming Blade on 
them as much as possible to kill them all off. After the area is 
cleared, leave the area to obtain a new weapon: the BOW.


++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

After speaking with Muramasa, replenish your health at the nearby SAVE 
STATUE and then take the village portal to Stone Circle Cove. Enter the 
newly revealed portal to the Underground Mausoleum.


++AREA: UNDERGROUND TOMB

In the next area, use nonstop Reverse Wind rolls to escape the laser-
filled hallway to the next area. Another alternate (but not 
recommended) way to get through this laser-filled area unscathed is to 
activate the Fire Wheels Ninpo.

Enter the next room to encounter some new enemies: Zombies. The archer 
Zombie is your biggest threat since his arrows are quite annoyingly 
strong. Use Izuna Drops on the archer and then use UT's on the other 
axe-wielding Zombies. 

In the next room, you'll be surrounded by more Zombies. You'll need to 
use Divine Cicada Slashes to avoid getting grabbed and molested. If 
worst comes to worst, use Ninpo to clear the room. From there, enter 
the next room.


++AREA: BLUE EYE ROOM

--OBJECTIVE: OPEN THE GATEWAY

The room will be filled with archer Zombies. Use quick Reverse Wind 
rolls as you cross the long bridge instead of running. If you get 
knocked down, you will have to face off against Dung Beetles and start 
the whole thing over. Make it to the other end of the bridge and then 
fling an arrow at the Blue Eye to open the gateway outside. From here, 
you'll be introduced to a more annoying enemy: the Black Kiyatts.

These pussycats are aggressive and like to use cheap attacks and grabs. 
Utilize your Bow by flinging arrows at them from mid-air. It is a bit 
difficult to perform the Izuna Drop on these pussies, so use a double-
jump and then start flinging arrows in mid-air for a better advantage.

When the room is cleared, exit out of the Blue Eye Room. Eliminate the 
cats in the room and enter the newly opened gate to find a SAVE POINT. 
SAVE your game and then jump down the chasm.


++AREA: LOWER TOMBS

For this next section, you'll encounter multiple rooms with lots of 
Kiyatts and archer Zombies. Utilize the Izuna Drop on the archers and 
then stick with flinging arrows at the Kiyatts.


++AREA: RITUAL ROOM ENTRANCE

In the next area, you'll encounter archer and axe-wielding Zombies. 
Eliminate the archer first and then use fully charge UT's on the others 
(use a far distance to avoid getting hit or grabbed). Exit the room to 
find some more axe-wielding Zombies. Take care of them with UT's and 
then exit out to find the SAVE POINT.


++AREA: RED EYE ROOM

--OBJECTIVE: OPEN THE GATEWAY

Again, use nonstop Reverse Wind rolls on the glowing platform bridge to 
void getting hit by the Eyeballs. Make it to the other side and then 
fling an arrow at the Blue Eye to unlock the gate near the SAVE POINT.

Once that's done, a bunch of Kiyatts and Archers will spawn in a big 
ambush. Izuna Drop the Archers and then fling arrows at the cats. Can't 
make it any simpler than that! When the area is cleared, hightail outta 
the room and SAVE your game. Now enter the next room.


++AREA: PHAROAH'S ROOM

You'll encounter some more Zombies. Blah blah blah. Clear the room to 
the next area where you'll encounter an archer perched high above the 
statues and some Dung Beetles. Use arrows on the spawning archers and 
then use the Flock Of Swallows on the Dung Beetles. When the area is 
cleared, exit and use the Bird Flip to the top of the room.


--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #9

In the area with the boulder, you'll hear a high-pitched shriek. Scream 
into the Nintendo DS MIC to reveal the Purple Bird. Equip the Shurikens 
(you won't be able to hit it with arrows) and smack it to reveal WOOD 
AMULET #9! YEEHAW! Use the Inazuma Ninpo to destroy the boulder and 
enter the next area.


++AREA: SUSPENSION BRIDGE ROOM

You'll encounter a gaggle of Kiyatts and some archers. Try to get some 
Izuna Drops on the Kiyatts and then deal with the archers last. Once 
the room is cleared, exit to find the SAVE POINT. When you're ready, 
enter the doorway for another boss battle!

This boss isn't too difficult as he seems. He likes to use simple 
ground pound attacks and the occasional up-close grab.

Simply use lots of Reverse Wind rolls to stay safe as he pounds the 
ground. When he stops, start charging for a full UT and then unleash it 
in his face. The first couple of attacks won't take away much of his 
health, but after some hard UT's in the face, he'll get weakened.
 
Stay evasive from his attacks and keep charging up UT's and unleashing 
them on his face until he keels over. When's knocked out, keep charging 
the UT and unleashing them to shave off lots of health. REPEAT!


Defeat this easy boss to obtain another DARK DRAGONSTONE!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

After speaking with Muramasa, it's time to purchase some well-deserved 
upgrades. If you've been utilizing the Ultimate Technique in lots of 
your battles, then you should have a healthy amount of cash in your 
pocket. Purchase the JEWEL OF THE SPIRIT SMITH and a LIVES OF THE 
THOUSAND GODS to keep Ryu in check.

Muramasa also has a new Hurricane Ninpo Scroll. Purchase that item as 
well because you will need it to solve a puzzle later in the chapter. 
Exit the village using the portal back to Stone Circle Cove.

SAVE your game at Stone Circle Cove and then enter the newly opened 
black portal to a familiar area.


++AREA: STAIRWAY TO THE IMPERIAL PALACE

Move forward towards the next area to encounter some Kiyatts and a lone 
Eyeball. Eliminate the Eyeball first and then use Izuna Drops on the 
pussies to clear the area. Enter the next area.


++AREA: ZARKHAN STADIUM

--OBJECTIVE: OPEN THE ZARKHAN STADIUM DOORWAY

Eliminate more of the Kiyatts and then enter the next room to find the 
SAVE POINT. The main Zarkhan Stadium doorway is locked shut. There are 
two other entrance doorways on the left and right side of the room.

Enter the one on the LEFT side to find a locked gate. Exit the room on 
the left and fight off some Kiyatts and Eyeballs. Clear the room and 
enter the next hallway for more Kiyatts. Eliminate them and then exit 
to a new area.


++AREA: HYDRACUBUS ROOM

A bunch of Werewolves will appear here, so bust out your Flock Of 
Swallows attack on them and abuse the Ultimate Technique to kill them 
off faster. Eliminate the wolf pack to open the locked gate. Make your 
way back to the locked gate and enter inside. Approach the big blue 
torch and extinguish the blue flame by blowing into the Nintendo DS MIC 
(YES that actually does work).

When the flame goes out, some Eyeballs and Werewolves will appear, so 
start the Flock Of Swallows party! When the area is clear, exit back 
outside for a goodie

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #37

Just south of the locked gate is the Blue Reservoir Room. A gaggle of 
Wasp Fiends will appear here, so smear them with the Flock Of Swallows 
to clear the area. Hear that squeaking noise? Approach the wall at the 
end of the room and SCREAM into the Nintendo DS MIC to unleash the 
Purple Bird. Strike it to reveal WOOD AMULET #37. YEAH!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Now go back to the room with SAVE POINT and take the doorway on the 
RIGHT side. Pass through the next hallway and ignore the Eyeballs. 


++AREA: UPPER ZARKHAN STADIUM

Pass through the upper balconies while eliminating some Kiyatts and 
Eyeballs until you reach the second blue torch. Extinguish the blue 
flame to open up the Zarkhan Stadium Doorway. Now work your way back to 
that doorway and enter through.


++AREA: CHAMBER OF EVERLASTING SLEEP - OUTER CORRIDOR

Use the Flock Of Swallows on the Wasp Fiends and traverse the adjoining 
corridors to the end. Use the Bird Flip to reach the top of Zarkhan 
Stadium with a SAVE STATUE. SAVE your game!


--OBJECTIVE: OPEN THE GATE ENTRANCE

Enter the next open doorway to encounter some Werewolves and a lone 
Eyeball. Ignore them and enter the next room to find a blue-diamond 
windmill sitting by itself. To activate the windmill, blow into the 
Nintendo DS MIC and then quickly exit and go back to the gate BEFORE it 
closes! You will NOT have time to restore your Ninpo, so if the door 
closes, REFILL your Ninpo and health and do it again.

Enter the gate to encounter an old foe!

He's BACK! Doku makes a return cameo, but this time he isn't as 
difficult to defeat as his Xbox version. Well, he wasn't difficult for 
me, but I don't know about you. His spectral form has a couple of 
killer moves:

--RUSH ATTACK
--FIVE-HIT COMBO
--HOVER SLAM
--THE STAB

The main point of this battle is to stay defensive at ALL times against 
Doku! DO NOT attack him head on or you will get smacked up! What you 
want to do is let Doku make the first move against Ryu.

Evade his attacks (especially his Five-Hit combo) and then retaliate 
with a charged UT in his face. When Doku puts his sword to the side, 
he'll go for the Rush attack. Use a well-timed Reverse Wind to roll 
away from the attack. Keep the UT pressure on him while staying evasive 
and you should be able to finish this battle with no problems.

Defeat Doku to obtain a DARK DRAGONSTONE!

++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

There isn't anything useful in Muramasa's Inventory as of yet, so don't 
buy anything! Make your way back to the portal and teleport back to 
Stone Circle Cove. SAVE your game and enter the newly opened black 
portal to a hot new area.


++AREA: MAGMA CAVERN

Equip the Shurikens and enter the next area. STAY where you are and 
start tossing lots of Shuriken at the Fire Bats until all of them are 
dead. When the coast is clear, use Reverse Wind rolls to roll under the 
jumping flames to the next area.

Repeat the tactic above and then exit to the next area.


++AREA: COG OF VIGOOR DOORWAY

--OBJECTIVE: OPEN THE COG OF VIGOOR DOORWAY

SAVE your game at the SAVE STATUE! Now make a left turn to enter a 
couple of magma areas. The next two sections of the cavern will contain 
One-Eyed Pincer Fiends and archer Zombies.

Instead of eliminating the archers, kill the fiends first and then deal 
with the archers last. Do this for both areas until you reach the Blue 
Eye Platforms. Now it's puzzle time!


            +++   PUZZLE: BLUE EYE OF VIGOOR PUZZLE   +++

This puzzle is as easy as it looks. Shoot an arrow at each Eye when it 
turns BLUE to sole this puzzle. If you shoot it when turns RED, Pincers 
and Archers will appear, so get it right!

When the COG OF VIGOOR DOORWAY is opened, make your way back to that 
area while fighting enemies in the way. When you reach the Cog Of 
Vigoor doorway, SAVE your game and then enter.


+++AREA: FLAME CAVERN

This next area will consist of two flame-throwing walls and a couple of 
Pincers. Roll towards the lower right side of the area and battle the 
baddies from there. Remember to use lots of Izuna Drops! After that's 
done, DO NOT LEAVE YET!


--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #44

As soon as you clear this area, the high-pitched shrieking will start 
happening. Stand in the lower right corner of the room and SCREAM into 
the Nintendo DS MIC to unleash the Purple Bird. Kill it to reveal WOOD 
AMULET #44! HAH!

Enter the next doorway to a find couple more flame-throwing walls (and 
floors). Ignore the archers and enter the next room.

In the next room, you will be inundated with lots of Pincers and a few 
Archers. Eliminate the archers first and then take care of the Pincers 
from the corners (so you don't get toasted). If worst comes to worst, 
activate Ninpo to eliminate the last batch of Pincers. WHEW!

After all that hi-larious fighting, exit the caverns to find the SAVE 
STATUE. SAVE your game and exit.


++AREA: MAGMA CAVERN STAIRWAY

A bunch of Wasp Fiends will be floating around the stairway. You know 
what will kill them all? Flock Of Swallows. Do it! Enter the doorway to 
the next area.


++AREA: FLAME HALLS

In this next section, Ryu will be encountering various enemies and then 
using the Bird Flip to reach the next area. When doing the Bird Flip, 
time your jumps after each flame-throwing wall spews its flame and then 
jump to the top. Simple as that! 

Make it to the top of the cavern and SAVE your game at the SAVE STATUE. 
Enter the Hall Of The Flame Dragon because its boss battle time!

Unlike that giant pork-hose of a boss in Chapter 5 and that Pokemon 
dragon from Chapter 2, Smaugan is a bit of a challenge to defeat. Here 
are a few moves he likes to use:

--FIREBALL
--FIRE BREATH
--CHOMP ATTACK

All of these attacks can be evaded with simple evasive rolls. Double-
jump or run in the opposite direction to avoid getting damaged from his 
Fire Breath and Fireball.

If you stand directly in front of him, he will attempt his chomp 
attack. The main point of the battle is to damage his head. If you 
charge for a UT, it will NOT damage him unless you are near his head. 
To lure his head towards you, stand in front of him and get ready to 
roll to the left or right side just before he lunges for the chomp.

Evade the chomp attack and then quickly roll in with a combo and a UT. 
Keep doing this for the majority of the battle until Smaugan keels over 
in pain. When he's down and out, use fully charged UT's to reduce a 
large chunk of his health. REPEAT!


Defeat Smaugan to receive another DARK DRAGONSTONE.

the Counter Attack. Purchase it from him if you have enough cash! From 
there, go back to the portal and teleport back to Stone Circle Cove.

areas will mostly contain of Pincer Fiends. Remember to use the Izuna 
Drop on them all and spam the Ultimate Technique to kill them all.

Eliminate the spiked Eyeball first and then deal with the Pincers last. 
After the whole bunch of them are dead, go to the upper right side and 
use a Bird Flip to the top and enter the next doorway to find the SAVE

to a large icy arena. Another gaggle of Pincers will show up, so start 
bringing the pain on their asses and use the UT. The more UT's you can 
pull off in this section, the better. Clear the area and then enter the 
next room. 

Jump down the chasm and eliminate some more Pincers. Watch out for 
falling stalactites! Kill them all to reveal the ART OF THE ICE STORM 
scroll! Now enter the next doorway to find a secret SAVE STATUE. Hear 
the high-pitched squeal? You know what to do here! Kill that Purple 
Bird to obtain WOOD AMULET #10! WOO-HOO!


--OBJECTIVE: EXTINGUISH THE FURNACE DOORWAY

Now work your way BACK near the Ice Hall entrance and take the other 
path to the LEFT side. When you enter the area, the path will be 
blocked by a fiery furnace. Activate the Ice Ninpo to extinguish the 
flames and continue through.


++AREA: THE ICE CLIFF

This next section will be quite frustrating, but do not let your guard 
down! For this section, stick with using the Flock Of Swallows on the 
Pincers and arrows on the spiked Eyeballs. As you ascend the path, 
repeat the strategy each time until you reach the end of the cliff.

Once you make it to the end of the cliff, you'll be swarmed with more 
Pincers. Again, use the Flock of Swallows and utilize lots of Ultimate 
Techniques to kill them all off.

Once the area is clear, enter the next area to find the SAVE STATUE. 
SAVE your game and then jump down the chasm to a boss battle!

Well, I'll be damned! Smaugan has a brother, who knew! In case you 
didn't already know, the boss uses Ice attacks that are exactly the 
same as his fire-breathing sibling. The only new attack he utilizes is 
the Stalactite Attack where he summons a bunch of stalactites to crash 
down on the floor.

The strategy remains the same from the Smaugan battle: damage the head 
as much as possible! After the boss loses about 10% of his health, 
activate an Inazuma Ninpo to knock him out. From there, use TWO double-
charged UT's on his head. If done correctly, he will get knocked out 
again! Do TWO more fully charged UT's on his head and it will knock him 
out AGAIN! Continue this tactic and the boss won't even have time to 
recover from the attack. It'll be over so quickly!


Defeat this boss to receive another DARK DRAGONSTONE!

++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

Purchase the final upgrade for Ryu's sword from Muramasa. After the 
purchase, Ryu will receive another item: EXPLOSIVE ARROWS. SUH-WEET!

Go to the portal and take it back to Stone Circle Cove. SAVE your game 
and enter the newly revealed black portal to a brand new area.


++AREA: SEA OF TREES

You will encounter another new enemy here: the Zombie Ninja. These guys 
are very grabby and like to run around you. Stay defensive and keep 
mobile so that the arrows don't hit you.

Use Izuna Drops and Flock Of Swallow attacks on all of them to clear 
the area (except for the invisible archers). Exit the area at the other 
end to the next road.

The next two sections of the road will be filled with large rolling 
boulders. Simply run from left to right (or vice versa) to keep from 
being squashed. When you reach the second road, you'll have to dodge 
boulders and tons of arrows. DO NOT use Reverse Wind rolls during this 
boulder run and stick to running in left-to-right directions until you 
make it to the end of the path.


++AREA: INNER PATH/BEACH FRONT

WHEW! Approach the SAVE STATUE and save up! Burn down the webbed 
gateway with an Inferno Ninpo and then exit outside to meet a very 
annoying enemy from the Xbox version: GHOST FISH!!! AAAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ghost Fish only have one attack and it consists of biting you. And when 
you have an entire swarm of fish biting you...you'll see what I mean. 
Utilize the Flock Of Swallows attack and then use nonstop UT's on them 
until they all perish.


--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #19

Work your way down the long beach front while destroying those 
goddamned fish until you reach the end of the isle. After you kill the 
last fish, you'll hear the high-pitched squeal. You know what to do, so 
DO IT! Kill the bird to obtain WOOD AMULET #19! BOOYA-KAH SUCKA!

When you reach the other end of the isle, some more Zombie ninjas will 
appear, so start the reaming by using the Flock Of Swallows and 
splattering lots of UT's in their faces. Kill them all to clear the 
beach front. Go up the stairs to find the SAVE STATUE and save up!


++AREA: INNER ISLE

Cross the pathway to encounter some more Zombie ninjas. Again, use lots 
of Flock Of Swallow attacks and UT's. Once that's done, enter the 
cavern to encounter some more of those zombies. Blah blah blah.

Exit the cavern to a small stairway with Ghost Fish and an annoying 
laser statue. Kill the fish and then quickly exit at the top to find 
the next SAVE STATUE. Save up and continue up the path to encounter 
more Zombie ninjas. BLECH!

Once you've reamed them all, exit outside (SAVE your game first) and go 
up the stairs while killing fish and avoiding that laser. Enter the 
next cavern to encounter Zombie ninjas and Warlocks. Equip the 
Explosive Arrows and use it against the Warlocks and then stick with 
Izuna Drops and Flock Of Swallows for the rest.

Exit outside to the last set of stairs. Avoid fighting the fish and the 
Warlocks and simply run to the end of the stairway. Bird Flip your way 
to the top of the chasm to find the SAVE STATUE and SAVE your game. 


Now use Inferno Ninpo to burn down the webbed gateway and then exit to 
a boss battle!

Fighting Obaba is exactly the same thing as fighting the boss from 
Chapter 3 (y'know, the one-eyed boss). She utilizes the same attacks 
and even uses the same movements from that boss. The only new attack 
that she has is her Black Crows Attack where she flings three black 
crows at you from her fat belly. Simply roll away three times to avoid 
getting smacked.

As usual, her weak spot is her giant blue belly. Wait for her to attack 
and then roll away. After she misses the attack, use a double-charged 
UT on her belly as many times before she attacks again.

That's pretty much it. Evade the black crows she flings, dodge her 
melee combos, and just UT her ass to death. This battle should be SO 
easy for you! Defeat Obaba to complete the mission.


                           MISSION COMPLETED!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Take the glowing item on the floor to obtain a new Ninpo Scroll: THE 
ART OF PIERCING VOID. This attack is a ground-based (and infinitely 
cooler) version of the Inazuma attack. Take it and enter the black 
portal to a new area.


++AREA: OUTER PYRAMID

--OBJECTIVE: FIND WOOD AMULET #34

When you enter the Pyramid area, you'll encounter a semi-new enemy: the 
Red Kiyatt. These pussies aren't that different from the black Kiyatts, 
so just utilize the Izuna Drop and lots of UT's into their fat faces to 
clear the area.

Once that's done...wait, do you hear that high-pitched squeal? Oh yeah, 
you know what that is. Move to the lower left side of the screen (near 
the pillars) and then fling that bird out and kill it to obtain WOOD 
AMULET #34! PLAYA HATER! Now enter the Pyramid.


++AREA: INNER PYRAMID - FIRST FLOOR

--OBJECTIVE: ACTIVATE THE FOUR WINDMILLS

Fight off the Kiyatts if you want or simply go downstairs and exit. 
It's up to you. WHATEVER.

In this next room are FOUR blue-diamond windmills. Activate them all by 
using the Hurricane Ninpo to open the doorway. You can try blowing 
them, but you'd end up looking ridiculous doing that. With the door 
open, go upstairs and fight some more baddies and then exit. As you 
enter the chasm, QUICKLY do a Bird Flip to the top or the protruding 
spikes will slice you up. Jump to the top to find the SAVE STATUE.


++AREA: INNER PYRAMID - SECOND FLOOR

--OBJECTIVE: SOLVE THE BLUE TORCH PUZZLE

Save your game at the statue and exit. Ignore the enemies at the 
stairway and take the next exit to a large room with THREE blue 
torches. You need to extinguish the blue flames and replace it with RED 
flames. If you haven't figured it out already, extinguish the blue 
flames by blowing them out. Once that's done, activate the Inferno 
Ninpo to light the torches with RED flames.


++AREA: KNIGHTMARE ROOM

A new doorway will open when you solve the puzzle, so exit outside. Go 
up the stairs to a large room. Two waves of enemies will appear in this 
room, so be ready! The first wave will consist of red Kiyatts. 

Eliminate them all and the second wave will introduce a new enemy: the 
Knightmare. These guys are aggressive with their large swords and like 
to swarm you. Your best bet at not getting beaten badly is to abuse the 
Flock Of Swallows. If they block the attack, keep trying to break their 
guard. Avoid using UT's since they have powerful combos and fireballs 
to distract you and lastly, stay mobile!

Kill all the Knightmares to open up the next doorway. Go up the stairs 
to the next room to find the SAVE STATUE. Save up and then take the 
chasm and Bird Flip to the top of the room.


--OBJECTIVE: SOLVE THE PYRAMID PUZZLE

The doorway to the boss is sealed shut, so take the opposite stairway 
to the upper room with SIX blue diamonds. To solve the puzzle, toss a 
projectile at each diamond when they turn BLUE. If you hit a RED 
diamond, be ready to face off against a gaggle of Knightmares! Hit each 
diamond when they turn BLUE to solve the puzzle! Now exit out and enter 
the newly opened doorway to find the SAVE STATUE and SAVE up!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Before you face off against the boss, you need to activate the torch in 
the room using the Piercing Void Ninpo. Once that torch is lit, get 
ready for an ambush of Kiyatts and Knightmares. Stick with the Flock Of 
Swallows to kill them all and the boss will show up...

Well, looks like a new boss has finally arrived! This large spider-
looking boss has a few powerful attacks up his sleeve(s):

--GRAB-AND-SLAM
--WHIRLWIND BLADES
--SPIDER POUNCE

The boss has a relentless attitude and is very aggressive, just the way 
I like it! There is no tricky footwork for this battle, so stick with 
the usual formula of charging up for UT's from a far distance while 
evading its attacks.

Avoid using too many combos on him from up front or else he'll pounce 
on you. Stay defensive and evasive and stick with Ultimate Techniques 
to finish off this boss. I can't make it sound any easier than that.


Defeat the boss to obtain another DARK DRAGONSTONE!

++AREA: HAYABUSA VILLAGE

Fighting off those Knightmares should've given you lots of cash in the 
bank. Purchase all of the remaining LIVES OF THE THOUSAND GODS from 
Muramasa to max out Ryu's health bar. Now take the portal back to Stone 
Circle Cove and SAVE your game. 

But BEFORE you take the last portal to fight Ishtaros, make sure to 
complete all the Fiend Challenges in Stone Circle Cove! Get all those 
remaining Wood Amulets and continue the mission. When you're ready, 
take the last golden portal to a new area.


++AREA: UNDERWORLD GATES - FIRST SECTION

This next section will be quite difficult, so be sure to have full 
health and lots of defensive skills ready to go! As you make your way 
up the path, you'll encounter numerous Kiyatts, archer Zombies, and 
Knightmares. I don't what else to tell you but good luck!

Once you make it to the other end, SAVE your game and cross the pathway 
to the next section.


++AREA: UNDERWORLD GATES - SECOND SECTION

You'll encounter mostly Kiyatts and Eyeballs for the next few areas. 
You should already know what to do, so DO IT! Reach the chasm and use 
the Bird Flip to the top (be careful because the chasm contains Ghost 
Fish instead of Bats). Jump to the top to find the SAVE STATUE and SAVE 
your game!


++AREA: UNDERWORLD GATES - THIRD SECTION

This next section consists of caverns with rolling boulders and 
Eyeballs to distract you. Ignore the Eyeballs and quickly dodge the 
boulders to the next cavern. When you reach the last cavern, you'll 
encounter some Kiyatts and a brand new enemy: the MACE-WIELDING OGRE.

The Ogre is the second-most powerful enemy in the game (the Knightmares 
are first) and require lots of hard combos to defeat. Stick to using 
the Flock Of Swallows and keep your distance. Defeat the Ogre and then 
leave the area to find the SAVE STATUE. Rest up because you'll need it 
to fight the next boss.

The FUPA having, muffin-top-abusing, bush-pig boss from the Hurricane 
Pack Volume 2 is back! Here are the moves that she wields:

--BATTLE WHIP
--FIEND CANNON BLAST
--FIEND RUSH
--HIGH HEEL STOMP


When the battle begins, Ishtaros will be invulnerable to your sword 
attacks. After a minute or so, the next couple of cutscenes will reveal 
a new weapon to Ryu: the TRUE DRAGON SWORD. With this new weapon, Ryu 
can now defeat Ishtaros. Here's what to do:

The only time that Ishtaros is vulnerable to attack is when she is 
casting her Fiend Cannon blast attack. Stay evasive by constantly 
rolling around her until she starts to fire up her blast.

Evade the blast and then immediately home in for a hard combo while she 
recovers from the blast attack. After pulling off 2-4 hits, IMMEDIATELY 
keep rolling away to make her repeat the process. Stay as far away as 
possible from Ishtaros because even if you block her attacks, it shaves 
away bits of Ryu's health. Keep baiting Ishtaros into using her blast 
attack so that you can rush in and blindside her.

With quick reflexes and fast combos, you can defeat Ishtaros. Just hang 
in there, you can do it! SWALLOW, YOU BITCH, SWALLOW!!!

(if you don't know how to do it by now, I weep for you) and then 
purchase the final LIVES OF THE THOUSAND GODS from him to increase 
Ryu's health to MAX and then use the SAVE STATUE.

The next couple of arenas will consist of very difficult battles 
against bigger enemies. I won't give anymore tips since you've already 
made it this far, so I'll just tell you what to expect per arena.


--ABYSS ARENA #1: KNIGHTMARES
PRIZE: WOOD AMULET #39 (SCREAM into the DS MIC after the battle)

--ABYSS ARENA #2: RED KIYATTS, GARGOYLES
Use the Flock Of Swallows on the Gargoyle to kill it.

--ABYSS ARENA #3: GARGOYLES


When you reach the fourth arena, SAVE your game and then approach the 
last arena to trigger the boss battle!

+++MASTER NINJA MODE NOTE:
There is ONE additional boss battle in Master Ninja Mode! Before Ryu 
approaches the final SAVE STATUE in Chapter 12, he will face off 
against the Black Dragon Clone. Read the details below for the info.

          |___/\___/|___/___/ |___/_/ \_\_|   |_| |____|___|


This battle is exactly the same as the opening battle with Momiji. Ryu 
CANNOT kill the Clone because it has no life bar. The Clone is prone to 
using lots of Explosive Arrows and abuses the Flying Swallow.

The point of this fight is to survive it! The Clone can kill you in 
only a few combos, so be evasive and defensive! Avoid using Divine 
Cicada Slashes or Flying Swallows and stick to using regular combos. 
Get in as much hits as possible and then fire up a Ninpo attack and the 
battle should be over after that.

This boss was SUPER lame in the Xbox version and it's STILL a lame-ass 
boss in the DS version. GODDAMN LAME! The boss has two primary attacks: 
SKULL BLAST and CHOMP CHOMP.

The main point of the battle is to keep the Emperor from climbing onto 
the platform that Ryu is on. As it jumps towards your platform, roll 
away and then start slicing away at its body as it tries to climb onto 
the platform. If it jumps to your platform and you don't roll away, the 
boss will grab you with its teeth and chomp you! AVOID THAT! Keep 
attacking the body as its climbs up and it'll jump away.

As the Emperor jumps from platform to platform, fling a nonstop barrage 
of Explosive Arrows at it to reduce its health. When it starts to toss 
Skulls at you, use left-to-right Reverse Winds and continue the tactic.


Keep it up for this super easy battle and the battle will be over in no 
time! See? I told you it was a goddamned LAME-ASS boss!

Oh dear god. They just HAD to save this broad for the last part of the 
game?!? If you've played the Xbox version, Nicchae was the exact same 
enemy as Alma and BOTH of them were annoyingly difficult to defeat. 
Here are the moves she likes to use:

--PINK FIREBALL
--FLYING SKULLS
--SNATCH-AND-GRAB
--SUPER FIREBALL


So far, the only strategy I found to be useful is to attack her with 
the Flying Swallow. It doesn't always connect when it hits her but it's 
your best chance since Nicchae doesn't stay on the ground.

Also, charge up for UT's whenever possible! All her attacks can be 
dodged by rolling away, but you need to be quick because she can 
instantly grab or smack you before you know it. 


++NOTE: I have not found a bulletproof strategy that worked for me. (In 
fact, I BARELY got by simply by using nonstop UT's.) If anybody has a 
tactic that worked against Nicchae, please e-mail me at the address at 
the bottom of the FAQ and explain how you did it. I will give you 100% 
credit if the strategy works.


After you defeat Nicchae, the final battle begins! And just for the 
record, the next boss battle is EASIER than the Nicchae battle.

This last boss is quite the powerful dingleberry......NOT! While he may 
have some powerful attacks, that doesn't make him a tough boss. Here's 
a list of his moves:

WHILE AIRBORNE:
--TALON GRAB
--FIREBALL BLAST
--ELECTRIC BLAST

WHEN KNOCKED OUT:
--ELECTRIC BLAST
--WING SMACK
--MOUTH CHOMP


The main tactic to reducing the boss's health is to use Explosive 
Arrows. LAME! While he's flying in the air, start flinging nonstop 
Explosive Arrows until he initiates an attack. When he starts his blast 
attacks, simply run from left to right around the arena. Stay mobile as 
he blasts you and you should get by unscathed.

The boss rarely uses his Talon Grab move but when he swoops down, use a 
Reverse Wind to roll away. Keep flinging arrows until he gets knocked 
out. From there, STAY AWAY from his head! Get a good distance away from 
the head and continue to fling Explosive Arrows as he lays there.

Be careful though, because even though he is knocked out, he will still 
initiate an Electric Blast. When he starts charging up, get ready to do 
a well-timed Reverse Wind. When he misses the blast, fling some more 
arrows, dodge the blast, fling arrows, dodge the blast...you get the 
idea. That's pretty much it! Stay evasive and mobile and continue 
flinging Explosive arrows until he reaches his last bit of health.

When the boss gets knocked out with 1% of his health left, he will not 
blast you anymore. To finish him off, approach his head and dodge his 
chomp attack (if you don't dodge, he will chomp and kill you). Slash 
his head to finish the battle!


      Mon Congrats, you just finished Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword!

--HEAD NINJA DIFFICULTY
Defeat Normal Mode to unlock the next difficulty called HEAD NINJA. The 
battles will be more difficult because the number of enemies will be 
increased per encounter.


--MASTER NINJA DIFFICULTY
Defeat Head Ninja Mode to unlock the final difficulty: Master Ninja 
Mode. In this mode, the enemies are WAY more relentless and a bit 
unbalanced because they all tend to attack all at once, so be prepared 
if you will take on this mode. 


--MASTER KUNOICHI
To play as the mysterious female assassin Rin (oh PUH-LEASE, it's 
obviously Momiji without the mask), you'll need to do a few things: do 
NOT die during the opening battle with Ryu and defeat the Chapter 1 
boss. This will unlock a new difficulty with a "different" female 
character. Also, this mode is NOT the same thing as Master Ninja Mode!
 

--WOOD AMULETS
After you complete the game, you can access Muramasa's safety deposit 
boxes with the collected Amulets in the MENU screen. Each Amulet you 
find in the game unlocks a special item like CUTSCENES, CHARACTER BIOS, 
and DIARIES. To find them all, you'll need to play all FOUR 
difficulties. Sounds like hard work, I know. 


--ADDITIONAL BLOSSOM PETALS
During the End Credits, the Touch Screen on the DS will show falling 
leaves. Tap the Stylus on the screen and more petals will appear where 
you tapped. Yeah, it's a weak discovery that I made, so what?

You've got a LOT of nerve to insult my FAQ, my friend. You want to 
start a flaming war? Bring it on.

--All of you douchebag prick cheaters using Action Replay
Seriously, who do you F*CKING A-HOLES think you're fooling by posting a 
hokey score of 99 million Karma on the Wi-Fi leaderboards? What's the 
matter, was the game too hard for you? Couldn't defeat that last boss? 
If that's the case, then YOU ALL SUCK!

Hey, I know you like to look at pictures of hot women. Don't you deny 
it! I run two websites for two VERY hot women and I'd like for you to 
do me a favor and give my sites a visit:

http://www.jessica-alba.com - World's Most Desired Woman
http://www.karolinakurkova.net - Victoria's Secret Angel

If you like what you see, then you have good taste. If not, then you 
seriously need to read some more Maxim magazines or something.
