---(0. Version History)--------------------------------------------------------


v0.50: This is the first version I uploaded to GameFAQs. The walkthrough is
       about half done, and nearly all the sections are incomplete. More to
       come!


---(1. Introduction)-----------------------------------------------------------


Hello, and welcome to my guide for Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story
for Nintendo DS. I intend for this to be a comprehensive walkthrough of the
game, so I have included a list of attacks, beans, items, enemies, and bosses
in addition to the walkthrough.

I will try to keep the walkthrough as spoiler free as possible, but there are
sure to be a few. If you are worried about spoiling the story, please wait
until you beat the game before reading this guide. If you aren't worried about
that, feel free to read the entire thing if you want to!

For completionists, I have noted in the walkthrough when new items, gear, etc.
appear. If you need to get to a particular part of the guide quickly, use a 
find box coupled with the above table of contents to navigate.

game.

---2.1 Controls----------------------------------------------------------------


Here, you will find the basic controls that you will use over the course of
the game. Some of the actions won't be available to you at the beginning,
so you will have to earn them before they become available. I will mark
these actions with a '*'. There is a potential for spoilers in this section.

---(2.2 Stats)-----------------------------------------------------------------


In this area, I will list what each stat means on the character info screen.

Name:          This is the name of the character you are looking at. It will 
               either be Mario, Luigi, or Bowser.

LV:            This is your current level. The higher it is, the stronger you 
               are.

HP:            Health Points. If you have ever played any other RPG, you know 
               what these are. Basically, this is your health. Keep it above 0
               if you don't want to see a game over screen.

SP:            Special Points. You need these to execute special attacks.

POW:           Attack power. Higher numbers mean more damage dealt.

DEF:           Defense. Higher numbers mean you take less damage.

SPEED:         The speed of your character. This determines who gets to attack
               first in battle. Higher numbers win.

STACHE / HORN: This affects the number of LUCKY strikes you get in battle and
               how high your chances are at winning with scratch cards.

RANK:          This is your current rank. These increase as you level, and 
               carry various benefits.

EXP:           Your current amount of experience points.

NEXT LV:       The amount of EXP you need before you go up another level.


---(2.3 Menu Items)------------------------------------------------------------


These are the items on the menu you can access in the game.

ITEMS:    Displays a list of the items you have acquired in the game. 
          Eventually, it also lists how many beans you have collected in each 
          area.

GEAR:     Displays the gear you have equiped on each character.

INFO:     Displays detailed information about each character you control.

BADGES:   This is where you set what badges Mario and Luigi equip. This menu is
          locked until you get your first badge.

SPECIALS: Displays a list of your current special attacks and allows you to
          practice with them. This is locked until you earn your first attack 
          piece.

MAP:      Views the map of the current area as well as the world map. The area
          map can also be viewed by pressing the Select Button.


---(2.4 Leveling Up)-----------------------------------------------------------


After Mario, Luigi, or Bowser gains enough EXP, they will level up! Leveling
Up gives various stat boosts, and after enough levels, will cause your rank to
increase. When you Level Up, you will also get to play a small minigame to
earn extra stat points!

Basically, this is a roulette game. Press the indicated button to stop the
wheel and claim your bonus. Careful, though. If you constantly boost one stat,
your bonuses will get smaller. To prevent this, try to balance your bonuses
across different stats!


---(2.5 Status Effects)--------------------------------------------------------


Every so often, you will come across a status effect that affects you or an
enemy. They are listed here along with their effects.

Poison:      Mario Brothers only. This status effect causes Mario or Luigi to
             take damage at the beginning of their turn. Bros afflicted with
             this will turn purple. Poison wears off after a few turns.

Sick:        This is Bowser's equivalent of poison. It does the same thing to
             him, but he turns light-blue when affected.

Burn:        Same as Poison or Sick, but also prevents whatever is affected
             from doing anything until it wears off. Brought on by fire-based
             attacks.

Fury:        Bowser only. If Bowser gets hit enough times in a single fight, HE
             WILL HAVE FURY! Fury causes his attack to double, but it also
             causes his defense to lower a bit. Bowser flashes red when he has
             fury, and it wears off after a few turns.

POW Up:      Gives a temporary boost to POW stat.

POW Down:    This causes whatever is affected by it to have a lower POW stat
             until it wears off.

DEF Up:      Gives a temporary boost to DEF stat.

DEF Down:    Same as POW Down, but for Defense.

Dizzy:       Similar to burn, but causes no damage. Usually brought on by
             attacks that target the head.

Off Balance: Similar to dizzy, but does not last as long.


---(2.6 Equipping)-------------------------------------------------------------


As you progress through the game, you will need to equip new clothes and
accessories on you characters. Changing your equipables can do anything from a
simple stat boost to giving you immunity to status effects. When you just start
out, you will only be able to equip one item per character. As your rank 
increases, you will eventually be able to equip three. However, you can only
equip one item of each type on each character. This means that, if Mario is
already wearing one HP Socks, you can't put EXP Socks on him until you take the
HP Socks off.


---(3. Background Story)-------------------------------------------------------


The Mushroom Kingdom is suffering from a strange new affliction: The Blorbs!
This disease causes all affected by it to swell up into a balloon shape and
roll away. The cause and cure are unknown, and more Toads are becoming 
Blorbed every day. Alarmed at this strange malady, Princess Peach calls an
Emergency meeting at her castle to decide what to do...


---(4. Character Intros)-------------------------------------------------------


This is a list of introductions written by me for several of the main
characters in this game. I am not going to attempt to cover minor characters
or characters that are not introduced early in the story.


Mario:
Everyone's favorite plumber! Mario has saved the Mushroom Kingdom countless
times and is always ready for anything. He has a kind heart and will readily
risk his life to save others. When Peach called a meeting at the castle,
she requested that Mario attend to help solve the problem of the Blorbs.


Luigi:
Mario's lesser known brother. Luigi is friendly, has a luxurious mustache,
and is a bit more timid than his brother. However, his timidness will not
stop him from helping Mario when he is needed! When Mario is called to
Peach's castle, Luigi tags along to see if he can help, too.


Princess Peach:
The benevolent ruler of the Mushroom Kindom. She cares deeply for her
loyal subjects, the Toads, and is troubled by their new sickness. Always the
target of kidnappings by Bowser, Mario has saved her from his clutches
countless times.


Toadsworth:
Princess Peach's advisor. He has been guarding and watching over her since
she was a baby and has panic attacks any time she goes missing.


Starlow:
A representative of the Star Sprites who watch over the Mushroom Kingdom.
She has a chipper and peppy personality and does not like being ordered to do
things. Peach requested her presence at the meeting to try to solve the
problem of the Blorbs. In the game, she functions as a sort of guide and gives
hints and tips along the way.


Bowser:
The self-proclaimed "King of Awesome" and ruler of the Koopas. Bowser's
primary goal in life is to kidnap Peach and rule the Mushroom Kingdom with an
iron grip. His plans are constantly foiled by Mario and "green-stache," so
Bowser hates the two of them with a burning passion. Always believing he is
more important than he actually is, he angrily storms into Peach's castle
when he learns of a meeting he wasn't invited to. After another defeat at
the hands of Mario, he is thrown out of the castle and into a forest. In
the forest, he is tricked by a shady mushroom merchant...


Fawful:
The vengeful, furious, hilarious antagonist of the game. In the original
Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, he was a minion of Cackletta. After a
crushing defeat at the hands of the Mario Brothers, he spent the next several
years in the sewers under the Mushroom Kingdom plotting his revenge.
Accompanied by his right-hand pig, Midbus, Fawful rises once again to seize
power.


Midbus:
Fawful's right-hand pig and ever-present bodyguard. Not much is known about
Midbus' past or why he joined Fawful, but he is completely loyal. He often
confronts Bowser so Fawful won't have to.


---(5. Walkthrough)------------------------------------------------------------


OK, this is probably the reason you're here. Remember, even though I'm trying
to keep this as spoiler free as possible, you are bound to see some if you
read this. Before we begin, I would like to share a few tips that will help
you progress in the game.

1. Use the save blocks! Any time you see one of these, you should hit it.
It may be a while before you get a chance to hit another one, so don't pass
them up!

2. Don't avoid enemies! Unlike most RPGs, the Mario RPG series has no random
battles. Instead, you enter battles by coming into contact with enemies in
the field. The only time you should skip enemy encounters is if you are low on
battery or time and need to get to a save block fast or if the enemy you are
about to fight will provide an insignificant amount of experience.

3. Never run from fights! If you run from a fight. you will lose coins and
miss out on valuable experience points. If you have been following tip #2
above, there should never be an instance where you need to run from a fight.

Now that I've mentioned those, on with the walkthrough!


---(5.1 The Blorbs)------------------------------------------------------------


Every good RPG needs an introductory sequence, and this one is no different!
When the cut scene is over, you will be given control of the Mario Brothers.
Take the action-icon tutorial offered by the Toad if you need it. Otherwise,
skip it. It doesn't offer any other critical information. When you are ready,
exit the room through the door to the north.

As soon as you enter the room, another Toad will talk to you. Feel free to
wander around this room and talk to anyone you want to. Before you leave this
room, get everything out of the four blocks floating in the room. To get the
contents of a box, simply jump while under it and hit it with your fist or 
head. The box in the northeast corner of the room contains 10 coins, but you
will have to jump repeatedly to get them all. If you take too long, you won't
get them all. It's not a big deal if you don't get some of them, but remember
for future blocks that this same thing can occur. After you hit all the 
blocks, exit through the doorway at the north.

Now, you are in Peach's throne room. In this room, there are more Toads to 
talk to, another floating block, and a new block that has many colors and a 
large "S" on it. This is a save block. Any time you want to save your game, 
you should hit one of these. There will be times when you can save in other 
ways, but save blocks are the most common. The other block contains a 
medium-sized coin worth 5 small coins. Grab that, and hit the save block.
As a general rule of thumb, you should save any time you see one of these.
There is a Blorbed Toad blocking the exit to the northwest, so we can't leave
that way. Instead, take the exit to the northeast.

After another brief cutscene, it's time for your first (and easiest) boss
battle!

===New Attack==================================================================

Jump: A basic jump attack

===============================================================================

===Boss: Bowser (Tutorial)=====================================================

This is a pretty basic fight. Toadsworth will offer you tutorials in how to
fight. Listen if you need them, skip them if you don't. Defeat Bowser by
jumping on his head until he collapses.

===============================================================================

After the fight and another cutscene, you will switch to controlling Bowser.
There is nothing you can do in this area right now, so go south.

As soon as you enter this area, you will be told how to smash rocks. Use the
X Button and smash the rocks as you make your way to the exit leading south
in the southeast corner. There is another exit leading east, but we should
ignore that for now since there is nothing we can do there at this time.

As with the previous area, you will be instructed on a new action when you
enter this area. This time, it's fire breath. Press Y and burn the trees as
you make your way to the east exit in the southeast corner.

In this area, proceed east and watch the cutscenes.


---(5.2 A Nasty Surprise)------------------------------------------------------


***Trash Pit*******************************************************************

Welcome to the Trash Pit. There is nothing to do in this area, so proceed to
the right to exit.

In this next area, you will need to jump over some pits of slime to get to
the far upper-right side. If you fall in any of them, you will be returned to 
the pipe above the entrance to the area. About midway through the area and 
above a platform, you will see a question mark block. Hit it repeatedly to get 
10 coins. There is another block in the alcove at the lower-right side of the
room that contains 3 mushrooms. Near the exit at the upper-right, you will
see a new type of block that sort of looks like it has a face. That is an
Emoglobin. Emoglobins provide hints, tips, and sometimes the ability to heal
your HP and SP and save the game. Jump and hit one to activate it. After
using the Emoglobin to save, exit to the right.

===New Item====================================================================

Mushroom: Restores 30 HP

===============================================================================

When you enter the next room, you will see a cutscene and a familiar face.
When the cutscene is over, walk over to the pipe at the far right side of the
pit and jump on it. Once on top of the pipe, press down to rocket yourself
into a ! block and activate another pipe. Do the same thing on top of this
new pipe to activate yet another pipe. Finally, enter the third pipe to begin
your first fight inside Bowser.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Goombule: A Goomba-like enemy that exists inside Bowser.

===============================================================================

Most enemies have the potential to drop items when defeated. This is random 
and not guaranteed to occur. When a new enemy will drop an item that has not 
been introduced yet, I will note it below the enemy.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

Syrup Jar: Restores 10 SP

===============================================================================

After the fight is over, Mario will have a short conversation with Starlow.
When that's done, use the platforms on the right to hop up to the exit.

In the next room, use the Emoglobin to save and proceed upwards. Kill any
enemies you encounter along the way. You can get an advantage in the battle
by jumping on the enemies before the battle instead of running into them.
After you jump up a few platforms, you will be able to go right or left.
Going left only takes you to a single Goombule. Kill that if you want, then
head right and get the coins out of the blocks. Afterwards, fall into the hole
and take the pipe leading left.

In the room the pipe leads you to, you will see a new type of Emoglobin. This
one can completely refill your HP and SP, but you can't use it to save. Use it
if you need to, then follow the path leading to the left. This path zig-zags
downward and eventually ends in an exit on the left. Be sure to get the coins
and mushroom out of the blocks along the way.

In this next room, you will encounter another cutscene and Luigi will join
your party! And, you get to fight another group of group of Goombules. Starlow
will teach you how to do a first strike and how to control Luigi. Defeat the
enemies like you have been, and an pipe will appear on the left side of the
room. Before you go in there, though, Starlow will show you how to use the
menu. If you want, she will also show you how to use items. Since you now have
access to the menu, you can see that you have some things that didn't show up
before...

===Item========================================================================

1-Up Mushroom: Revives a fallen bro with half HP.

===Gear========================================================================

Thin Wear:     Basic overalls

===============================================================================

Afterwards, Starlow will offer a tutorial on how to use the map. Accept or 
decline, and head through the pipe to the left of the room.

In here, save at the Emoglobin and proceed to the right. Kill the enemies as
you go, and get the 1-Up Mushrooms out of the block next to the exit on the
far right.

In the next room, go down the steps and talk to the Emoglobin if you want to.
It will tell you how to better move around with Mario and Luigi if you want.
It just tells you how to properly jump as the duo, so you don't have to listen
if you already know how. Before you leave the room, head up the platforms
in the middle of the area to get 3 more Mushrooms. When you are ready, hop
across the pits and leave through the exit on the right.

Here, you will find an elevator platform (Metroid, anyone?)that will take you
upwards. To make the elevator work, have the Bro whose block is lit up jump. Do
this repeatedly, and you will eventually be able to leave through the top right
exit.

Proceed to the right in the next room, and you will come to a box with a
picture of a hammer on it. We can't do anything with it for now, so save at the
Emoglobin and proceed through the middle right exit.

In the next area, you will see yet another new type of block: an attack piece
block! Each of these blocks contains one or more attack pieces. Collect all 10
in an area for a new special attack! After you get the attack piece, grab the
3 Syrup Jars out of the ? block and head through the right exit.

In the next room, there are 8 more attack pieces. You won't be able to go
any further until you get them all, so do that. Afterward, head through the
door on the top left.

In this room, collect the final attack piece. Congratulations, you have earned
your first special attack!

===New Special Attack==========================================================

Green Shell: An attack where the Bros. kick a green shell back and forth 
             between them. Costs 3 SP to use.

===============================================================================

Watch the demo or practice your new attack, if you like. When you are finished,
exit the menu to enter a battle against some enemies and try out your new
attack!

===New (one-time) Enemy========================================================

Elite Goombule: Looks like a blue Goombule, but wears a helmet that stops
                damage from jumps. Kill it with the Green Shell!

===============================================================================

When the fight is over, head through the exit on the left to go back to the
room with the hammer box.

In here, hit the ! block, watch the scene, and get your new hammers! 

===New Key Item================================================================

Hammers: Allows Hammer attack and is used to smash stuff.

===============================================================================

Watch the tutorial about how to use them, and smash the boxes to continue to 
the exit on the lower right.

Fall down into the pit. If you need to get back up for any reason, you can use
the pipe you land near. For now, though, you should proceed right and whack the
thing sticking out of the wall with your newly acquired hammers. This will
cause a door to open above you, and an egg will roll out of it. Whack the egg
with a hammer to trigger a battle with a new type of enemy.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Spike Blop: A green blob with spikes on its head. Don't jump on it; doing so 
            will only hurt you!

===New Attack==================================================================

Hammer:     The current Bro will swing a hammer backwards and strike an enemy. 
            Useful for enemies that can't be jumped on. Wait for the right time
            to strike, but don't overcharge it!

===============================================================================

This is another tutorial battle set up to teach you how to use the hammers in
combat. Starlow will show you how to attack / defend with the hammers, but you
can skip her tutorials if you want to. When the fight is over, a pipe will
appear from the ground. Use it to get to the ledge above and go through the
exit at the top right.

In here, grab the coins from the block and proceed to the right. You can get
first strikes on the Spike Blops in this room, but don't jump on them! You will
take damage just like you do in battle! Instead, hit them with your hammer.
This rule applies to any enemy that can't be jumped on, so watch out! At the
right end of the room, there is a block that contains 3 Syrup Jars. Grab them
and head through the exit to get out of the Trash Pit!

Now, you will be looking at a "world map" of Bowser. There's not much available
right now, but more areas will open up later. To continue the story, need to
go to the Funny Bone. You could also visit the Challenge Node, but there's
nothing that you can do there right now. For now, you should go to Toad Square.

***Toad Square*****************************************************************

This is, basically, a "town" area inside Bowser. Here, you will find a couple
shops, be able to fully restore your HP and SP, and talk to a few Toads about
what's going on.

===New Item Shop===============================================================

Toad Square Item Shop: The Item Shop in Toad Square. See the Shops section for
                       inventory!

===New Items===================================================================

Nut:                   Restores 20 HP to both Bros.
Refreshing Herb:       Cures status effects

===New Gear Shop===============================================================

Toad Square Gear Shop: The Gear Shop in Toad Square. See the Shops section for
                       inventory!

===New Gear====================================================================

Picnic Wear:           Better than Thin Wear
Leisure Wear:          Better than Picnic Wear
Gall Socks:            Makes enemies 50% more likely to target you
Starched Socks:        Boosts your defense by 10%
HP Socks:              Boosts your HP by 20%

===============================================================================

When you are done with everything in here, exit the way you came in and head
to the Funny Bone.

***Funny Bone******************************************************************

This is a really small area that we will only need to use once. After you enter
the room, head to the far right side and whack the protrusion with a hammer.
Then, hit it again. Finally, hit it a third time and take control of Bowser!

***Cavi Cape*******************************************************************

===Gear========================================================================

Shabby Shell: A basic shell for Bowser.

===============================================================================

You are now in a large, cavernous room. There is nothing to do here for now, so
head through the exit to the east.

When you enter this next room, Starlow will show you how to switch between the
Mario Brothers and Bowser. Note that, if you are in an area as the Mario Bros.
and switch to Bowser, it will usually reset the position of the Brothers to the
beginning of the area. After the tutorial, smash the rocks and head toward the
door at the north end. The door is closed, so we need to open it. Time a punch
so that you hit one of the falling balls to do so, and head north.

In the next area, head west to have Bowser uncover a startling truth, then go
north again.

This next area has a save block, so use that and walk onto the grey, cheese-
like block and ride it to the east, smashing rocks as you go. If you fall off,
walk back up the ramp and try again. Smash the block to get 3 Hot Drumsticks
and head east to get out of the cave.

===New Item====================================================================

Hot Drumstick: Restores 80 HP to Bowser.

===============================================================================

In this next area, head east to trigger a cutscene and a boss battle!

===New Attack==================================================================

Punch: Bowser's basic melee attack. Bowser will walk up to an enemy and begin
       charging a punch. Press X as he finishes to hit the enemy with full
       force. Overcharge it, though, and Bowser will fall on the enemy.

===Boss: Midbus (Tutorial)=====================================================

This is a basic tutorial fight to teach you how to use Bowser. It only lasts
for a few turns, so don't worry about how much damage you take. The first
attack he will use is a roll. As he nears Bowser, press X to knock him away.
Throughout the battle, Fawful will give Midbus advice. Try to use Fawful's
advice for your advantage, but make sure you do the opposite of anything he
directly says to you. There is no way to dodge Midbus' bouncing slam attack.
The battle will end after he does it.

===============================================================================

After the fight, continue onward to the east.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Chuboomba: A fat Goomba with a huge lollipop on its back.
Borp:      A little, purple blob that can not fight Bowser. If Bowser kills it,
           it yields 1 coin.

===============================================================================

In this area, head a little to the east and kill the Borp for some coins. Small
enemies in the field will be instantly KO'd by Bowser, so don't be afraid to
run over them! You won't get any EXP for this, but you will gain a few coins.
Punch the block for 10 more coins, then walk toward the south. Punch the block
in the southwest area for 2 more Hot Drumsticks, then head through the
southwest path.

In here, follow the sloping path downward. There is a block on the path with
five coins in it, and a block hidden behind a boulder with a Hot Drumstick. We
can't go past the trees that border the southwest portion of this area yet, so
head along the southeast path.

===New Chakroads===============================================================

Cavi Cape Exit: Warps you to the exit of Cavi Cape.
Cavi Cape Cave: Warps you to the room where the falling balls were.

===============================================================================

In this next area, you will uncover your first Chakroads and learn how to use
them. Chakroads will be really handy later in the game. When the sequence is
over, head east.

In this tiny area, walk into the cave.

The path leading north won't take you anywhere yet, and you can't use the huge
button in your current state. So, head through the southeast exit and enter
Plack Beach.

---(5.3 Blocks, Flames, & Dogs)-----------------------------------------------

***Plack Beach*****************************************************************

As soon as you enter the area, you will see a normal block and a save block.
Smash the normal block for 2 Hot Drumsticks and save at the save block. When
you are ready, head along the north path.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Drillbit Crab: A hermit crab with a drill for a shell. It can not fight Bowser.
               Yields 5 coins if killed by Bowser.

===============================================================================

You can't go past the trees in the middle of this area yet, so you will need to
take the long way around the rock structure. Head east, and hop on the raft.
Punch the wall to your left to sail east into the next area.

In this next area, you will keep going until you hit a wall at the far east.
Punch the southern block here, and get ready. You need to hit the east set of
blocks near the coins to get back to the path, but the raft doesn't stop for
you. Punch the wall while you are moving! If you miss it, punch your way around
and try again.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Toothy:          A column of teeth that roams Plack Beach. Looks like the 
                 cactus enemies from previous Mario games.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

Fiery Drumstick: Restores 150 HP to Bowser.

===============================================================================

Now, you will be back in the area with the rock structure, but you will be on
the other side. The west exit has nothing for Bowser, so ignore that for now.
Smash the block for 10 coins and head to the north.

As soon as you enter this area, a cutscene will start. When you get control
again, you will be playing as the Mario Bros. Select Arm Center from the map
and get ready for a minigame.

***Arm Center******************************************************************

This is another tiny area in Bowser. Whack the cannon with a hammer to start
the game. Mario and Luigi will have to hit a ball of light into Bowser's 
muscles to power them up. Mario should hit it if it's orange; Luigi should hit
it if it's green. If you miss a swing, you will lose some coins. When the game
is over, you will go back to controlling Bowser.

***Plack Beach*****************************************************************

Bowser will walk ove to Broque Monsieur and receive an awesome new block!

===New Key Item================================================================

Vacuum Block: Allows Bowser to control the power of the Vacuum Shroom and use 
              in battle!

===============================================================================

And, of course, Broque Monsieur gives you a tutorial on how to use your new
power in the form of a tutorial boss battle

===New Attack==================================================================

Vacuum: Not really an attack so much as a feature of Bowser. Bowser can inhale
        small enemies and take things from some larger enemies. Small enemies
        that are inhaled will be sent to the Mario Brothers to be dealt with.

===Boss: Broque Monsieur=======================================================

Before the fight really starts, Broque Monsieur will give you a retry clock.
Fight him like you would anyone else. Have Bowser punch him, or you can inhale
him and let the Mario Brothers deal with him. The only real attack he uses is
to grow with a Mega Mushroom and rush toward you. Just punch him to stop the
attack and then hit him some more for free coins. Any time you hit him, he will
drop one coin.

===New Item====================================================================

Retry Clock: Allows you to retry a battle with full HP / SP if you lose.

===============================================================================

When the fight is over, you can head to the west for some extra experience if
you want. Whether or not you do, though, you will need to go to the north in
this room to continue on.

In the area directly north of the Broque Monsieur fight, smash the block for 3
Hot Drumsticks and go north, again.

Partially obscured by the trees in the center of this area, there is a block
that contains another Hot Drumstick. Grab that, then head north again.

The next area has quite a bit of scenery that Bowser can't do anything with,
but there is a save block. Save, and continue north once more...

After a brief cutscene in the next area, you will get to fight another boss.

===Boss: Sea Pipe Statue=======================================================

This is your first real boss fight. You won't be able to do any damage to the
statue by attacking it directly, but the Stone Blooper on top of it is
vulnerable. When you start the fight, inhale the Stone Blooper and have the
Mario Brothers deal with it. After it takes enough damage, it will fly toward
one of the Brothers. Smack it with a hammer to send it flying out of Bowser
and into the statue's base! Afterward, Bowser can punch the Stone Blooper for
added damage. Repeat this process until the boss is dead. Of course, you should
dodge its attacks as best as you can. Detailed information about the boss'
attacks can be found in section 10.2.

This boss may drop a 1-Up Deluxe.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

1-Up Deluxe: Revives a fallen Bro with full HP.

===============================================================================

After the fight, the statue will return to normal and the Mario Brothers will
be able to access a new area inside Bowser.

On a side note, you can now access your first challenge in the Challenge Node.

===New Cholesteroad Challenge==================================================

Green Shell:     This challenges you to kick a green shell back and forth
                 between Mario and Luigi as many times as you can without
                 missing. B Rank score is 100, A Rank is 150. If you pass A 
                 Rank, you will get a Challenge Medal.

===New Challenge Gear==========================================================

Challenge Medal: This medal increases all the stats of the enemies, but also
                 makes them drop more coins. Use this if you want tougher
                 fights or more money!

===============================================================================

Whether or not you choose to take it on is up to you. When ready, head to the
Pump Works.

***Pump Works******************************************************************

In this area, swim up and over the wall and head right.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Bubble Blooper: A Blooper that has been filled with water. They only appear
                the Pump Works is underwater.

Dried Blooper:  A Bubble Blooper that has lost all of its water content. They
                only appear when Pump Works os dry.

===============================================================================

Save at the save block, and continue along the path. Swim up and get the 3
Mushrooms out of the ? block, then press down on the orange pipe to go to a new
room.

There is a lone ? block in this room. Hit it, and it will multiply into a
pattern of red and green blocks. Memorize the order, then hit the blocks in the
order they appeared. Mario should hit the red ones; Luigi needs to hit the
green. If you mess up, you will have to start over. Do it successfully, and you
will get the first attack piece of the area! When you're done, head back into
the pipe to go back to the room with the save block.

As soon as you emerge from the pipe, swim up to get a Retry Clock from the ?
block over your head and continue through the exit on the right.

Grab the Attack Piece as soon as you enter this room, and keep heading right.
When you come to a hole in the floor, drop into it and move Bowser away from
the statue to drain the area of water. Then, whack the button to your left with
a hammer to open a door to the right. Bowser will need to drink water again
before you can get past the bone, but make sure you are out of the area with
the first button to keep from getting trapped, first. You will need to drain
the area again to hit the other button, but you should go into the pipe on the
right, first. This will take you to the lower part of this room where you can
get a Mushroom and some coins out of a couple of ? boxes. After you grab those,
head left to go into the lower part of the room you were just in.

In here, grab the coins and 1-Up Mushroom out of the three ? boxes and proceed
to the left. Hit the button on the wall to open a path leading back to the
upper area, then swim up through it and head right into the room with the
moving bones again.

Proceed to the right side of the room again and swim up onto the bone next to
movable bone. Drain the area, then hit the button with a hammer. Drop into the
hole, then fill the area with water again so you can get past the movable bone.
After that, swim over to the pipe that just appeared and go down it.

When you emerge from the pipe, you will be in a room with a large door. We need
to get a key item before we can open it, so don't worry about it for now. Save
at the Save Block and continue to the right.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Protobatter: Looks like a caveman with a spiked club. It grows when it is
             attacked.

===============================================================================

In here, swim up the into the alcove above the entrance for two more Attack
Pieces. After getting them, drop back down again and continue to the right.
Swim up and around the wall. You can go to the left if you want some extra
experience, but when you are ready, you should swim up to the exit on the right
and grab the fifth Attack Piece before leaving.

There's nothing to do in this next room yet, so just keep swimming to the right
until you go through one of the exits.

In here, swim to the right and hit the pink ! block to deactivate the gate.
Go right, again.

As soon as you enter this room, grab the sixth Attack Piece. Proceed along the
platforms t the right until you come to an alcove above the exit. Hit the ?
block here for 5 coins. Then, drop down and head through the exit on the right.

When you enter this room, swim up high and get the syrup jar out of the ?
block. The scary-looking worm thing in this room is called a Chombone. You may
have seen one a few rooms ago, but this is the first time you will use one for
something. Hit the button on the right wall to make an object float out of the
floor. Push it from the right side, and it will float into the Chombone's
mouth. The Chombone will leap out and smash through the bone that was keeping
you from going further down. Now that that's out of the way, drop into the hole
and hit the ? block to start a memory game like the one you played for the
first Attack Piece in this area. Complete it to get the seventh Attack Piece,
and head right.

Drain the water in this room, then keep going right. A cutscene will start, and
you will learn the Mini Mario technique! Make Mario tiny, and proceed left to
hit the switch on the wall. Another short cutscene will happen. When it's over,
make Mario normal sized and hit the switch on the wall to your right to open a
path through the floor. Have Bowser drink water to fill the area again, then
proceed through the opening. Swim and hit the ? block for a Nut, then drop down
and make Mario tiny to send him through the narrow space. Make Mario go to the
right. There is a ? block here that contains a Picnic Wear. Grab that, then go
up and hit the button to open the path on the lower left side of the room.
Take Mario back to Luigi, make him normal sized, save at the Save Block, and
head through the bottom left exit.

When you enter this room, swim all the way up to get some coins out of a ?
block. Then, drop back down and go left to get the eighth Attack Piece. Go
upwards and get a Mushroom out of the block to your right, then head through
the left exit.

There are two Chombones in this room. One will let you get an Attack Piece, and
the other will help you progress through the area. Hit the button to the left
to release another object from the floor, then push it to the right to feed
the Chombone. Fall down into the hole it opens up to get the ninth Attack
Piece, then swim back up and repeat the process for the Chombone on the left.
Drop down the new hole, and use Mini-Mario to go through the narrow passage
and hit the button. Change Mario back, then swim up and go through the path
you just opened up.

Grab the final Attack Piece for a new Special Attack!

===New Special Attack==========================================================

Fire Flower: Mario and Luigi will each get a Fire Flower and hold a fireball.
             Press the button of the brother with the big fireball to throw
             fire at random enemies. At the end of the attack, Mario and Luigi
             may be able to throw firebsalls simultaneously. Costs 4 SP to use.
             May cause burns to your enemies.

===============================================================================

Now, advance to the left and hit the button on the wall to release a giant
object. Swim up after it, but there's a wall stopping you from feeding it to
the giant Chombone. Push it left and follow it into the next room.

In here, push the object as far left as you can so that it stops over top of
the cannon. Then, drain the area so that the object falls into the cannon.
Fill the area again, then send Mini-Mario into the area with the button. Grab
te coins out of the block, then hit the button to fire the cannon. Make Mario
normal again, and continue into the room on the right you were just in.

The object became stuck on a lip attached to some bones! Swim around it and
push it to the left to feed the giant Chombone and open the path to the item
that acts as a key for the big DNA door from earlier. Follow the path, and grab
the Stingler!

===New Key Item================================================================

Stingler: An item that might shock something. Where should you use it?

===============================================================================

Now that you have the Stingler, it's time to head back to that DNA door to see
what's inside. Swim back up and head to the left to re-enter the cannon room.

There's a ? block in this room, but we can't get it from here. Head left again.

Drop down, then swim up and around the wall to get to the passage that leads to
that ? block I just talked about. Make Mario mini, and send him in.

Hit the ? block for a Fighter Wear!

===New Gear====================================================================

Fighter Wear: This pair of overalls has less defense than the Leisure Wear, but
              gives a small POW boost.

===============================================================================

Now, send Mario back to the left to reunite with Luigi.

Make Mario normal again, then follow the path all the way down to the bottom
left exit.

Save at the Save Block again, then press up on the door to use the Stingler to
open it and head through it to leave the Pump Works and open new areas in
Bowser.

The area you need to go to now is the Flame Pipe. Move the Brothers there, and
enter the area.

***Flame Pipe******************************************************************

This area is pretty small; there are only two rooms. In this first room, climb
up to the top of the area and send Mini-Mario through the passage so he can
hit the button on the left wall and remove the barrier. Then, send him back,
make him normal, and head right.

Climb up to the top of this new room to start a cutscene and a boss fight!

===Boss: Scutlet===============================================================

This bug is blocking the great Bowser's flame pipe! Squash it to restore
Bowser's flaming awesomeness! 

This will be your first real boss fight as the Bros. It's not too hard, but
don't let your guard down. It only has three attacks, and none of them are too
hard to dodge. Pay attention to the eyes. It attacks whoever its looking at.
Toward the end of the fight, it will start getting two attacks per turn, but
that just means you can deal more damage from counterattacks.

===============================================================================

After another brief cutscene, you will switch back to (the now flame-enabled)
Bowser. 

***Plack Beach*****************************************************************

Burn the trees in the area with the Y Button to try out your new power. You can
head south to use the save block if you want, but come back here and go east
when you are ready.

Flame the trees, then proceed east to start another cutscene and tutorial boss
fight.

===New Attack==================================================================

Flame: Bowser unleashes his flame breath upon the enemy. This attack hits all
       enemies on the bottom screen and has a chance to inflict burn status.
       Press and hold X when Bowser reaches full charge to deal the highest
       amount of damage.

===Boss: Broggy================================================================

This is a tutorial fight to teach you how to use Flame Breath in battle and
defend with your shell. Broggy isn't too tough, but you can't attack him head
on. Flame him to get him to expose his back, then punch him to inflict massive
damage. Just like Broque Monsieur, he will drop one coin for each time he is
hit.

===============================================================================

After the fight, go south a bit and get 5 coins and a Hot Drumstick out of the
blocks. Then, go east and flame the trees so you can go north.

Save at the Save Block, then proceed north into Dimble Wood.

---(5.4 Over the Wigglers & Through the Woods)---------------------------------


***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

===New Enemy===================================================================

Treevil: An evil tree that roams Dimble Wood. It throws branches at its foes,
         and is weak to fire attacks. Sometimes, it will have a fruit on its
         branches that Bowser can inhale to recover some HP.

===============================================================================

Burn the trees to the west and get 50 coins out of the block. Then, go a little
ways north and get 2 Hot Drumsticks out of another block. Afterwards, proceed
along the north path.

Punch the head on the Wiggler stone in here and memorize the combination it
displays. Flame the bushes next to the stone for some coins, then head east.

Here, punch the body segments on the Wiggler statue in the order the stone in
the previous room displayed to activate it. On my playthrough, the order was:

1, 3, 2, 4

Go east a bit and burn the bushes for a couple more coins, then hit the block
for 50 more. When you are finished, head back west.

Head north a bit through the newly opened passageway to reach a new store!

===New Item Shop===============================================================

Monsieur Broque's Item Shop: This is the only item shop that will do business
                             with Bowser.

===New Gear Shop===============================================================

Broggy's Gear Shop:          Broggy sells gear to Bowser. This is the only
                             gear shop that will sell to Bowser.

===New Gear====================================================================

Special Shell:               Better than the Shabby Shell
Safety Shell:                Better than the Special Shell

===============================================================================

Monsieur Broque also offers information about battles. When you try to leave,
he will call you back and explain about Blitties. After that, head north.

Burn the tree and head west.

Smash the blocks in this area as you make your way around the pillars and to
the west. Burn the bushes at the end for a couple of coins, then take the ramp
down into the next area.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Scutlet: A smaller version of the Scutlet boss that the Mario Brothers had to
         fight in Bowser's Flame Pipe. It can't fight Bowser. Yields 5 coins if
         Bowser kills it.

===============================================================================

Use the Vacuum on a Treevil in this area to get your first Blitty!

===New Key Item================================================================

Blitty:    A Blitty from a monster.

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #3: Gotten by using Vacuum on a Treevil.

===============================================================================

Proceed to the west, torching everything in your path. Burn the bushes for
coins, then get a Retry Clock out of the block in the southwest corner. Once
you're done with that, head west again.

In this area, stand on the yellow pad and flame the fuse to send Bowser flying
three screens to the east.

There's a save block here that you can use if you want. Torch the tree next to
it to reveal another Chakroad!.

===New Chakroad================================================================

Dimble Wood: A Chakroad that transports you into the middle of Dimble Wood.

===============================================================================

Now, it's time for a bit of backtracking to get some nice equipment. Step into
the Chakroad, and select Cavi Cape Cave.

***Cavi Cape*******************************************************************

When you reappear, you will be in the area directly east of the cave Bowser
woke up in. Head north one screen.

Remember that flimsy-looking material that blocked the west exit of this area
because Bowser couldn't torch it? Not a problem, now! Flame that thing and go
through the exit.

There are two blocks in this area. One contains the Judge Shell, and the other
contains Red-hot Fangs.

===New Gear====================================================================

Judge Shell:   Better than the Safety Shell. Free, too!
Red-hot Fangs: Boosts the strength of Bowser's Flame attack by 20%

===============================================================================

Head east one screem then north one screen to get to a Save Block. Use it if
you want, then head east two screens.

Use Vacuum on a Chuboomba for another Blitty!

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #1: Gotten by using Vacuum on a Chuboomba.

===============================================================================

Head south one screen, then torch the trees in the southwest corner of this
area to open a path to a new area of the map.

In the southwest and northwest corners of this area, there are two boxes that
each contain some coins. Grab those, then head back the way you came in.

Head east two screens, enter the cave, then go through the southeast exit to
get to Plack Beach.

***Plack Beach*****************************************************************

Use the Save Block if you need to, then burn the trees to reveal another
Chakroad. Then, head north one screen.

===New Chakroad================================================================

Plack Beach: Takes you to the entrance to Plack Beach near Cavi Cape.

===============================================================================

You don't need to use the raft any more, so burn the tree on the west side of
the stone wall for a shortcut. Use Vacuum on a Toothy to get another Blitty!

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #2: Get this by having Bowser use his Vacuum on a Toothy

===============================================================================

Head north two screens, then burn the trees in the northeast corner of the area
to access a new part of the map.

Go all the way east to reach another raft. Punch around on it to reach a shore,
then hop off and head west.

Punch the block in this area for 50 coins, then head east again, take the raft
back, and head west to get back on the main path.

Burn the trees again, then follow the path back into Dimble Wood.

***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

Head north two screens to get back to where you were before we started
backtracking. You can drop off the Blitties at Monsieur Broque's shop on your
way if you want, but he won't give you anything yet. When you are ready, head
north again.

There's nothing in this next room except for a couple of Treevils, so head
north again.

A cutscene will start as soon as you enter this area. When it's done, burn the
nearby bushes for a couple of coins and head north.

Press X on the giant Wiggler statue in this area to cause Bowser's Arm Center
to react, then send the Mario Brothers over there to help out.

***Arm Center******************************************************************

Hammer the button next to the cannon to start the Arm Center mini game.Play the
mini game just like last time. The only difference is that it will be a bit
faster. When you finish, you will be in control of Bowser in Dimble Wood again.

***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

Head east one screen.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Trashure:  A treasure box enemy that attacks by throwing stuff. Don't avoid the
           Mushrooms or coins it throws at you, but be sure to punch the other
           stuff! After a certain amount of damage, the lock will fly off and
           you will be able to inhale coins from it. The Trashure will randomly
           run away.

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #4: Get this by using Vacuum on a Trashure.

===============================================================================

Use Vacuum on the Trashure in this room to obtain the 4th Blitty, then head
back to Monsieur Broque's shop for a Block Band.

===New Gear====================================================================

Block Band: Gives a 20% DEF boost to Bowser when equipped. This is a reward for
            giving 4 Blitties to Monsieur Broque.

===============================================================================

Afterwards, head back to the area with the Wiggler bridge, cross the bridge,
and head south.

Punch the cage full of Goombas until it breaks to earn Bowser's first Special
Attack!

===New Special Attack==========================================================

Goomba Storm: Goombas will rush toward an enemy. Touch them with the stylus to
              set them on fire and deal additional damage! Costs 6 SP per use.
              May inflict burn status.

===============================================================================

A battle will start against a couple of Treevils to give you a chance to
practice your new move. When it's over, head north.

Cross the bridge, then go north again. Before you go through the north exit,
there is a bush that you can burn for 10 coins. Torch that, and go north again.

Burn the bushes when you enter this area for 11 coins, then torch the trees and
get a Syrup Jar out of the block behind them. Go a little east and burn another
bush for another coin and get the Hard Ring out of the block.

===New Gear====================================================================

Hard Ring: Boosts Bowser's defense by %20.

===============================================================================

The west exit won't take us anywhere right now, so head north.

Hit the block in this area for 10 coins, then go north again.

Save at the Save Block if you want, then head north once more.

A cutscene will start as soon as you enter this area. When it's over, head
along the path to the east.

There are stone columns blocking all paths in this area except for the one
leading south, so go that direction.

Flame the bush near the bridge here for 10 coins, then cross it. On the other
side, there is a Wiggler stone similar to the one you saw in the first part of
Dimble Wood. Punch the head, and memorize the order of the flashes. The south
path won't take us anywhere we need to go yet, so head east.

Just like last time, there's another Wiggler statue here. However, the body
segments are in reverse order compared to the stone in the last area. Punch the
body segments in the correct order. On my playthrough, it was:

4, 1, 3, 2

Head west one screen to get back to the last area, then cross the bridge and
head north.

You will see a patch of carrots in this area, but there's nothing you can do
with them. Head east.

There's nothing more than a bit of nice scenery and a few monsters in this
area, so head east again.

As you enter this area, a cutscene will start. After that, go south a bit and
smash the block for a Retry Clock. Then, head north.

Save at the Save Block, then head north again.

Walk up to the huge carrot in the ground to start another cutscene and control
Mario and Luigi again. Send them back to the Arm Center once more.

***Arm Center******************************************************************

Whack the button to start the mini game again. This time, however, the cannon
will fire several balls at once. Remember the order, and use rhythm to smack
them back and power Bowser up. When it's over, there will be another cutscene,
and you will need to send Mario and Luigi to the Gut Check area in Bowser.

***Gut Check*******************************************************************

Walk up to the cannon in this room to start the Gut Check mini game. Tap the
chunks of carrot with the stylus to break them up. If an enzyme appears when
you break a chunk, tap it to break up several other chunks!

Keep an eye on Bowser while he is eating. If his mouth flashes, remember which
chunk of carrot falls at that time. Tap that chunk to reveal a super-enzyme
that will break a LOT of carrot chunks! 

After the practice session, send the Brothers back to the cannon to start
things for real. If you fail, you will have to try again.

When the game is over, you will be in control of Bowser again.

***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

Wiggler will give you an opportunity to save. You should probably do that. 
When you are ready, talk to Wiggler to start a boss fight!

===Boss: Wiggler===============================================================

This is kind of an interesting fight. Before you can deal any damage, you will
need to turn his body segments yellow by attacking them. Then, you can hurt him
by punching his face. After a few turns of yellow-mode, Wiggler will go back to
normal and you will have to start the process over again.

Occasionally, a couple of Leaf Guys will fly in carrying a giant turnip. Inhale
them to drop the turnip on Wiggler and turn him completely yellow. The Brothers
will have to defeat them, then. If you don't inhale them, they will drop the
turnip on Bowser.

===============================================================================

After the fight, Wiggler will give you the Banzai Bill!

===New Key Item================================================================

Banzai Bill: This landed in the Wigglers' fields several years ago. Fire it at
             the castle!

===============================================================================

Head south, use the Save Block, then head south again.

A cutscene will start. When it's over, send the Brothers to the Nerve Cluster.

***Nerve Cluster***************************************************************

Advance to the right in here to trigger another boss battle!

===Boss: Durmite===============================================================

This worm was hiding inside the giga-carrot. It's not too tough, but feel free
to check the bosses section for detailed information.

If it eats a Bro, it will probably fire him above the other Bro's head. Don't
jump.

===New Gear Drop===============================================================

POW Gloves: Raises attack power by 10%. Dropped by Durmite.

===New Guantlet Class==========================================================

Durmite X:  This is the first class of the Guantlet in the Challenge Node.
            Costs 200 coins to attempt. Must KO enemy within 5 turns.
            Recommended level: 18 and up.

===============================================================================

After the fight, continue to the right.

Nothing to do in this room, so go right again.

Step onto the blue floor to be sent into the pit. A cutscene will start, and
Bowser will learn how to do the Sliding Haymaker. 

***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

Move Bowser a bit south and talk to the tiny Wiggler. Then, smash into all the
boulders with your new move to clear them out. Go through the northwest exit.

Nothing to do here but fight Trashures. Go west again.

Smash the columns to clear the way to the west exit, then head west once more
to get back to the cannon.

A cutscene will start when you enter this area. When it's over, you will be in
control of Mario and Luigi. Send them to Rump Command, quickly!

***Rump Command****************************************************************

Use the Save Globin in here to save your game, then walk to the boats to learn
about Bowser's condition and how to help him. Board the boats, and begin the
mini game.

Starlow will give you a tutorial on how to do this. Focus on shooting the balls
with the correct Brother, and try not to get hit. When the meter fills up, you
will need to shoot at a large, blue ball several times. This one can be shot
by both Brothers. It will also try to shoot back at you, so watch out!

After you win, you will be in control of Giant Bowser.

***Dimble Wood*****************************************************************

===Giant Bowser Battle=========================================================

Bowser's Castle

This is a fight against Bowser's Fawfulized castle. You will be offered a
tutorial that explains how to fight. Take it if you need to, don't if you
already know how.

The Castle takes the same amount of damage from punches and flames, so use
whatever you are more comfortable with. If Spinies come out of the front,
flame them before trying to punch it to avoid taking damage.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

Star Candy: Completely restores HP and SP.

===============================================================================

When the fight's over, Bowser will return to normal size. Head north into
Bumpsy Plains.

---(5.5 To The Castle!)--------------------------------------------------------


***Bumpsy Plains***************************************************************

There are several boulders blocking your path in this room. Use the Sliding
Haymaker to clear them out, then save at the Save Block. Head north.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Flifit:      An enemy that lives in Bumpsy Plains and looks like a Sunflower.
             Vacuum it to drain it of its leaves and disable it until it gets
             watered.

Lakitu King: A Lakitu with a crown on its head. This enemy never appears in the
             field, but it may appear alongside a Flifit. Vacuum it to send it
             to the Brothers!

Sneed:       A baby Flifit that looks like a sunflower seed. It can't fight
             Bowser. If Bowser kills it, it will yield 5 coins.

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #5:   Get this by vacuuming a Flifit.

===New Gear====================================================================

Gold Ring:   This has no use except for selling. Dropped by Lakitu King.

===============================================================================

Vacuum the first Flifit you see in this area for the fifth Blitty. The bushes
in the northern part of this area contain a few coins. When you are ready, go
to the west.

Smash the block in this area to reveal a new Chakroad.

===New Chakroad================================================================

Lake-Plain Border: This Chakroad is a warp to Bumpsy Plains.

===============================================================================

After you activate it, go east again. 

You can go to the north if you want some experience, but there's nothing else
there. When you are ready, go south.

On the east side of this area, there is a raft. Hop on it, and punch around
until you get to the area to the north.

Continue punching, and you will get to an island. Break the block for a Safety
Ring.

===New Gear====================================================================

Safety Ring: Boosts Bowser's HP by 20%.

===============================================================================

Take the raft back, and head through the northeast exit.

There are a couple of bushes in this area with coins hidden in them. After you
get them, go up the ramp and use the Sliding Haymaker to cross the gaps. Hit
the block west of the north exit for 50 coins, then go north.

Go up the ramp to your east and burn the bush for a few coins. Then, use the
Sliding Haymaker to cross the gap and reach the exit. Go into the cave to enter
Bowser Path

***Bowser Path*****************************************************************

Use the Save Block in here. The funny TV-looking block in here is actually a
remote Monsieur Broque shop. You can buy stuff from it as well as get your HP
and SP restored. There are some new gear and items in there, so be sure to
check it out. While you're at it, the item shop in Toad Square also has some
new stuff.

===New Gear in Shop============================================================

Armored Shell:  Better than the Judge Shell.
Lucky Band:     Doubles your chance of getting a lucky hit.
Iron Fist Band: Increases the power of Bowser's Punch by 20%.

===New Item in Shops===========================================================

Super Mushroom: Heals 60 HP
Supersyrup Jar: Restores 20 SP
Super Nut:      Heals 40 HP to both Brothers

===============================================================================

When you are ready, go north.

Head up the ramp to the east. At the top of the ramp, break the block for some
coins. Then, cross the gaps and continue to the east.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Chain Chawful: A Fawfulized Chain Chomp. If you inhale the Fawful clone off of
               its head, it will leave.

Fawful Guy:    A Fawfulized Shy Guy. It is too small to fight Bowser. It will
               yield 10 coins if Bowser kills it.

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #6:     Obtained by vacuuming a Chain Chawful.

===============================================================================

There is a Chain Chawful in this area. Use Vacuum on it to get the sixth
Blitty. The conveyors around here will push you in whatever direction they are
rolling. You can use the Sliding Haymaker to clear them faster. The block in
the southeast part of this area contains a Power Band.

===New Gear====================================================================

Power Band: Boosts Bowser's POW by 10%.

===============================================================================

Go through the northeast exit.

Free the Shy Guys in the southeast part of this area for a new special attack!

===New Special Attack==========================================================

Shy Guy Squad: A squad of Shy Guys will appear, and Bowser will roll into a
               ball. Move the stylus across Bowser from right to left to make
               them push him further into it and power up the attack. When time
               is up, Bowser will fly toward the enemy for massive damage.
               Costs 8 SP to use.

===============================================================================

Go through the northeast exit to get out of the cave.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Fawfulcopter: A remote UFO used by Fawful to spy and communicate. It appears
              alongside Chain Chawfuls outside of the cave. Inhale it to let
              the Brothers deal with it. If you don't, it will call more Chain
              Chawfuls to the fight.

===============================================================================

You can take the southeast exit as soon as you enter if you want a view of the
castle, but when your are done, you should cross the bridge to the north and go
through the northeast exit.

Ignore the path to the north, and go through the southeast exit.

A cutscene will start as soon as you enter this area. Looks like you won't be
able to enter the castle, yet. Save at the Save Block, and continue east.

Nothing to do in this area. Go east, again.

Cross the bridge to the south, and go through the southwest exit.

Go a bit west to start a cutscene. When it's over, send Mario and Luigi to the
Arm Center.

***Arm Center******************************************************************

Whack the button, then play a more complicated version of the rhythm game you
played the last time you were here. When it's over, you will be in control of
Bowser again.

***Bowser Path*****************************************************************

Go one screen east, take the northwest exit, then head west again to get back
to the castle.

Save at the save block again, then go north to get to the door. Before you go
through it, burn the Fawful poster on the east side with the flap coming loose
to reveal a path you can use later. Head through the door.

***Bowser Castle***************************************************************

You will be greeted by a few Goombas when you enter. Talk to the various
minions in the lobby. Then, head west.

Talk to the minions in here, too. Then, head east.

The door at the north end of the room will open. You can go east and talk to
more minions, if you want. When you are ready, go through the door.

Save at the Save Block, then continue along the path. Take the first west path
you see to come to a block with 2 Fiery Drumsticks. Then, take the next east
path to get to a block with a Supersyrup Jar. Head north.

Proceed to the north to learn that you have nowhere to sit. Then, walk up to
the stage to completely establish that there are no open seats left. Walk back
to the center of the room to start a cutscene. When it's over, a boss battle
will start.

===Boss: Midbus================================================================

This is no tutorial battle! Midbus means business, this time. This fight takes
place in front of a live audience. If you land solid hits, you will be given
coins. If Midbus lands solid hits, he will be given coins and food. Vacuum the
food to restore your HP and stop him from recovering. If you vacuum a ham, you
will also get a POW Up status effect.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

TNT Drumstick: Heals 280 HP for Bowser.

===============================================================================

After you win, Bowser will be treated to the magic feast of honor. Eat the 6
delicious dishes to trigger another cutscene. When it's over, it will be Mario
and Luigi's turn. Send them to the Flab Zone.

***Flab Zone*******************************************************************

Climb up to the top of this room and go to the left. Hit the ? block for a
Retry Clock, then use the Save Block on the right and go through the exit on
the right.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Tenderling: A piece of meat that has a bone sticking through it. It attacks by
            rolling.

Calorite:   Looks like a flame holding sticks. Don't jump on it!

===============================================================================

Grab the first Attack Piece as you enter this room. You can bounce high on the
bouncy floors if you time your button presses correctly, but it's difficult.
Bounce into the ? block for some coins. As you reach the end of the bouncy
floor, bounce into the other ? block for a Super Mushroom. Go right, again.

A cutscene will happen as you try to proceed in this room. When it's over,
continue through the exit on the right.

Another cutscene will trigger as you enter this room. When it's over, you will
have your first badges!

===New Badges==================================================================

Good Badge:     A badge for Luigi. This causes your meter to rise when you pull
                off any Good to Excellent strike. It is the weakest of Luigi's
                badges, but also the easiest to use.

Mushroom Badge: A badge for Mario. This causes the Brothers to be healed when
                the badge is used.

===============================================================================

You will get a tutorial on how to use the badges. When it's over, climb up the
flab to the left and cross the bridge to avoid the mucous pit. Then, head right
again.

This area is the entrance of a maze of pipes. There's some good stuff hidden in
here, so we will be going to all the rooms. Start by entering the green pipe in
the upper right.

The two blocks at the top of this room contain a Super Mushroom and 5 coins.
Upon hitting the block in the lower right, a challenge will start. You will
have to hit hit it with a Brother, then it will fly to the other. Hit it again,
and it will fly back again. Continue this process until the counter reaches 0
to get 4 more Attack Pieces. The block will speed up as it is hit. After you
get them, go through the green pipe on the lower right.

Drop down to the bouncy floor and bounce high to reveal some invisible blocks.
Keep revealing them until you have a complete path. Then, go back up there and
hit the three blocks for a Super Nut, POW Boots, and 10 coins.

===New Gear====================================================================

POW Boots: Gives a 10% boost to POW.

===============================================================================

After you get those, go through the red pipe on the lower left.

Heading along the platforms to the left, you will see 2 blocks that contain a
Supersyrup Jar and some coins. Get those, then drop down and head to the right.
The blue Emoglobin in here is called a Nutsoglobin. He will offer to show you
the correct way if you can answer his questions. Talk to him, and use the
information below to pass the quiz.

Bowser's body is normal
His throat is kind of dry
His head feels fuzzy
He's paranoid, and other places are feeling kind of weird
His stomach is gurgly and hot because of the giga-carrot
He doesn't want to talk about it anymore because his whole body could shut down

Bowser's castle is the best castle ever made
It is powerful and awe-inspiring
It's like looking at Bowser
The best part is a treasure chamber underneath it
He took the treasure by force
It sleeps like a giant, golden baby
Fawful remodeled the whole thing
Fawful turned his military training facility into Fawful Theater
When Bowser gets out, he will make it the Bowser Theater

If you miss a question, you will have to fight an enemy. When you win, you will
be given 50 coins and told the correct path. However, we want to explore this
place. Go through the green pipe at the lower right.

Suspended above each floating, bouncy platform in this room is a ? block. The
left one holds coins, the right one holds a Syrup Jar. Get those, then go back
through the green pipe you used to get in here.

Hop up to the red pipe on the upper right, and go in it.

Talk to the Nutsoglobin in here, and use the information from before coupled
with the new information below to pass his test.

Fawful is a cooking prodigy
His flavors are unbelievable
Bowser liked his General Fawful's Spicy Chicken the best
Inside the spice was delicacy and body
Bowser could eat it forever
The flavors in Fawful's cake blew Bowser's mind
The cake had rich cream and fluffy sponge exploding like a taste volcano
Bowser was shocked that a guy that weird had such skills

Bowser is not a fan of Chippy
She is always yapping about stuff
She comes off kinda superior
Bowser doesn't even know what she is
He wants to know where she is, just once
He can't complain, though, because she's in there fixing him up
He will have her work for a few more shifts

When you pass the quiz, Nutsoglobin will give you 100 coins and tell you that
the correct path is through the green pipe on the top right. However, we are
going through the red pipe on the bottom right.

Save at the Save Block, then hit the ? block to start another block challenge
like before. Complete it for 4 more Attack Pieces. Just 1 more! Go down the
green pipe on the right side.

Jump as soon as you come out of the pipe to reveal two hidden blocks. Then,
advance to the left. Jump across the gap, then jump again on the ledge to
reveal two more hidden blocks. Then, Whack the bump sticking out of the ground
to release a puff of air and learn the Spin Jump. Follow the tutorial to learn
how to use it. Use the whirlwind to cross the gap, then fall into the mucous
pit. You will land on top of the second set of hidden blocks. Spin Jump across
the gap and walk into the wall to enter a hidden room.

The two ? blocks in this room contain an Ultra Nut and EXP Socks.

===New Item====================================================================

Ultra Nut: Heals 80 HP to both Brothers.

===New Gear====================================================================

EXP Socks: Boosts EXP gained by 30% if the wearer takes no damage in a fight.

===============================================================================

Go left to get back to where you were after getting the stuff out of the
blocks.

Cross the gaps and go all the way left. Hit the Attack Piece block for the
final Attack Piece of this area and a new special attack!

===New Special Attack==========================================================

Jump Helmet:     Luigi will wear a helmet with a spring platform, and Mario
                 will try to jump on it repeatedly. Move Luigi so he is under
                 Mario, and press A as Mario lands to power this atttack up.
                 Press A as Mario lands on the enemy to power it up even
                 further. This attack costs 6 SP to use.

===New Cholesteroad Challenge==================================================

Juuuuump Mode:   This is the Jump Helmet Cholesteroad challenge. Unlike other
                 challenges, this one doesn't speed up or get much harder as
                 time goes on. Collect red timers to increase your time, and
                 avoid the blue ones that decrease your time. If you get a
                 yellow timer, time will freeze and the blue timers will
                 disappear for a bit.

                 If you get an A Rank on this challenge, you will get Daredevil
                 Boots.

===New Gear====================================================================

Daredevil Boots: Causes you to deal 2x damage with all attacks, but a single
                 hit will knock you out.

===============================================================================

You can also do a new Cholesteroad challenge now, but I recommend waiting until
after you finish the Flab Zone. Go down the green pipe.

Drop into the bouncy floor of this area and bounce near the middle to reveal
four hidden blocks. Then, climb up the platforms to the right. There are two
blocks up here that have 5 coins and a 1-Up Mushroom in them. Grab those, then
cross the gaps to the left and go down the red pipe.

Make Mario mini and send him into the corridor on the right. Navigate your way
to the top, then bounce around until you reveal 7 hidden blocks. Bounce up to
them, then hit the button on the wall. Take Mario back to Luigi and make him
normal again. Then, jump on the newly revealed bouncy floor to be rocketed to
the top of the room. Talk to the Nutsoglobin up here for another quiz, and use
the information from before as well as the new info below to answer the
questions.

Bowser is immobile
Even if he wants to do evil, he can't move
He won't strut out in front of Peach and everyone like this
Especially not Mario
Bowser really doesn't want Mario to see him like this
That'd be insane
If Bowser fights Mario in this condition, he will just pancake him into dust
Not a bad evil plan

Bowser has a few solid ideas about how to KO Fawful
His current plan is to get up on Fawful Theater again and fight him
He will throw stuff at Bowser, but Bowser will laugh and inhale him
Fawful might try to escape on his flying thingie
However, the Paratroopa Squadron will blast him out of the sky as he flees
Fawful uses a lot of weird machines
But, Bowser will just use his Bob-omns to blow them up
But, first, Bowser has to escape from the floor
That's a problem

After you win, you will be given 200 coins and told that the correct path is
through the red pipe. We're done exploring, so take his advice and go down the
red pipe.

The first ? block you see in this room holds coins. The second holds a
Supersyrup Jar. The third holds more coins. Use a Spin Jump on the platform at
the end to get to cross the gap, then go down the green pipe.

The left block in here contains a Supersyrup Jar and the one on the right has
2 Super Mushrooms. Save at the Save Block, and head right.

Proceed up the platform, and use the Spin Jump on the group of enemies to
disperse them. Then, fight another boss!


===Boss: Alpha Kretin==========================================================

This fight is divided into two parts. In the first part, you will have to
destroy several small parts. The orange parts can only be harmed by Mario; the
green can only be damaged by Luigi. In the second part, you will have to deal
with one true enemy and several fakes. The real one will swap places with the
fakes, so make sure you remember which is which!

If you take too long on the second part, you will have to repeat the first
part.

See the Bosses section for detailed info.

===New Item Drop===============================================================

Max Syrup Jar:  Recovers 40 SP.

===New Guantlet Challenge======================================================

Alpha Kretin X: This is the second guantlet challenge. It's a powered up
                version of Alpha Kretin. Costs 400 coins to attempt.
                Recommended level: 22.

===============================================================================

After the fight, proceed to the exit on the right.

You'll get another cutscene as you try to progress in this room. When it's
over, climb up the platforms. Hit the ? block for 100 coins, then head right
again.

Another cutscene will start as you enter this room. After it ends, you will be
in control of Bowser.

***Tunnel**********************************************************************

Save at the Save Block, and be sure to check out Monsieur Broque's shop.
There's some new gear available. Also, there is a new challenge in the
Challenge Node.

===New Gear in Shop============================================================

Vampire Band: On punch attacks, restores 8% of Bowser's HP.

Glutton Ring: Allows Bowser to eat two Drumsticks at once.

===New Challenge===============================================================

99 Block:     This is a VERY tough challenge. The 99 Block is located in the 
              upper part of the Challenge Node. It's basically a block
              challenge like the ones in the Flab Zone, but it goes all the way
              to 99. It continually speeds up until it hits about 75, and it's
              very tricky to keep it going until the end.

              If you successfully complete it, you will be given the option to
              double your coins. You don't have to do it immediately, so it's
              best to save it for when you have a large amount of them. The
              bonus will only be given out once.

===============================================================================

The pipe leads to a dead end, so go along the path to the southeast.

Flame the bomb to blow up the wall, then use the Sliding Haymaker to cross the
gap and go east.

===New Enemies=================================================================

Choomba:   A train-like mecha-Goomba. It attacks by charging toward Bowser. If
           there are Coalbits on the screen, it may eat them to power itself 
           up.

Coalbit:   A lump of coal with pinchers. Inhale them to send them to Mario and
           Luigi. If you don't, they will be eaten by the Choomba. Coalbit's
           can only be fought alongside Choombas. This enemy can not be harmed
           by fire.

===New Blitty==================================================================

Blitty #7: Gotten by vacuuming a Choomba.

===============================================================================

Drop down and go down the ramp. Use Vacuum on the Choomba in here for a Blitty.
Smash the boxes near here to reveal another Chakroad.

===New Chakroad================================================================

Underground Tunnel: This warps you to the first part of the Tunnel.

===============================================================================

The pipe in here will take you back to the first room, so ignore it for now.
Head through the west exit at the top of the ramp.

Flame the bomb, then head west again.

Punch the block you see as you enter this room for 5 coins, then go a bit west
and smash another for Special Fangs.

===New Gear====================================================================

Special Fangs: Boosts Bowser's max SP by 20%.

===============================================================================

Go down the ramp and smash the block in the southwest corner for a few more
coins, then go through the southeast exit.

The two blocks on the north side of this room contain 10 coins and a Supersyrup
Jar. Grab those, then go down the first ramp. On the far east side of this
platform is another block with 10 coins. Go down the remaining ramps and
through the southeast exit.

Go all the way east in this area to get to a strange machine and a block. Break
the block to get 10 coins, then press the button on the machine to make it
release a bomb. Light the fuse on the bomb and immediately punch it to blow
open a hole in the wall to the west. Then, release another bomb. Light the
fuse, then punch it when the countdown reaches 3 to blow open another hole.
Finally, release and flame another bomb and punch it when the countdown is at
2 to open the last hole. Go through the westernmost one.

The boxes on the north side of this room contain a Rock Shell and 100 coins.

===New Gear====================================================================

Rock Shell: Better than the Judge Shell, but not as good as the Armored Shell.

===============================================================================

Go back into the room with the machine, and go in the hole on the east side.

Break the block in here for a Cheap Ring.

===New Gear====================================================================

Cheap Ring: Reduces the SP cost of a random special attack by 30%.

===============================================================================

Go back to the room with the bomb machine again, and this time go in the middle
hole.

Smash the block you see as you enter this room for 50 coins. Then, break the
boulders to continue. Flame the bomb to the north to create a shortcut back to
the start. If you want, you can take the shortcut back to use the Save Block
before continuing. When you are ready, walk up the ramp, and cross the gap to
the south. Keep crossing gaps and work your way around to the exit at the
northeast corner. Go through it.

A cutscene will start as you enter this room. When it's over, send Mario and
Luigi to the Leg Outpost.

***Leg Outpost*****************************************************************

A tutorial will start as you enter this area. Follow it to learn how to play
this mini game. When Mario is on the bottom, stomp with A. When Luigi is on the
bottom, stomp with B. If they split up, stomp with both buttons. Hold the
buttons for a bit before releasing to increase the power of the stomp.

The mini game is timed. You will have 1 minute and 30 seconds to finish it. If
you don't, you will lose 50 coins and have to start over. When you reach the
end, you will be in control of Bowser again.

***Toad Town*******************************************************************

You are now in the caves beneath Toad Town. Walk into the doorway.

Step into the center of the platform to start a cutscene. When it's over, send
the Brothers to the Pipe Yard.

***Pipe Yard*******************************************************************

Hop over the fallen red pipe to the left and go down the purple pipe.

***Toad Town*******************************************************************

Congratulations! You have just left Bowser's body and are in the same caves he
collapsed in. Use the Save Block, and head west.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Nooz: These enemies look like the noses of Mario and Luigi. This enemy may drop
      a Happy Charm.

===New Gear====================================================================

Happy Charm: Boosts your chance of getting a lucky hit by 50%.

===============================================================================

Walk into the east yellow pipe.

You are now out of the caves. Hop up the steps and go west.

Hit the ? block on the west side of this area for up to 100 coins, then go down
the steps and head east.

Hit the ? block in here for a Thrift Charm.

===New Gear====================================================================

Thrift Charm: Reduces the SP cost of a random special attack by 40%.

===============================================================================

Go west again, and head back up the steps. Use the Spin Jump on the air blowing
out of the ground near the bridge to be shot into the air. Continue to use it
on the other pocket up here, and make your way to the pipe on the west.

Do the same thing in this area to make your wau to the pipe leading east at the
top.

Go east a bit and hit the blue shell block to release blue shells flying across
the Mushroom Kingdom. Some blue paratroopas will teach you how to use them.
When Mario has a blue shell, whack him with Luigi's hammer to send him flying
forward. Use this to hit the paratroopas and earn another special attack.

===New Special Attack==========================================================

You Who Cannon: Mario and Luigi will multiply and jump into several barrels.
                Remember their positions! As the cannons bounce up, press the
                button of the Bro within to fire him out!

                To make it easier to remember which cannon has which Bro, only
                try to memorize the position of the Bro with the easier
                pattern. If a cannon lifts that doesn't match the pattern,
                press the other button!
                
                This attack costs 7 SP per use.

===New Cholesteroad Challenge==================================================

Yoo Who Cannon: This will test your mastery of the Yoo Who Cannon special
                attack as well as your eye speed and ability to control
                yourself. Like all Cholesteroad challenges, this will speed up
                to unimaginable levels as you near that coveted A rank. Stay
                calm, and feel free to read the detailed hints in the
                Cholesteroad section further down in this guide.
 
                If you get an A rank, you will be rewarded with 500 coins and
                a pair of Bro Socks.

===New Gear====================================================================

Bro Socks:      Boosts your DEF by 100% if you are holding a KO'd Brother.

===============================================================================

Work your way back to the pipe and go back through it. Head west.

Go into the doorway to see Bowser and start a short cutscene. When it's over,
you will be back outside the room. Go east one screen and head north.

===New Enemy===================================================================

Fawflant: A Fawfulized ant. It has a drill on its abdomen that can poison.

===============================================================================

Cross the bridge and head a bit north to get to two ? blocks that contain a
Super Nut and up to 50 coins. Continue working your way around and head north.

Hit the Shell Block in here to get a Shell, then go down the steps. Don't jump,
or you will lose it. Have Luigi whack Mario with the hammer when he is facing
the switch that looks like a faucet to rotate the bridge. Cross over to the
other side and whack the northwest and southeast switches to make a bridge near
the Toad at the entrance of this area. Hit the ! block to activate the first of
three lights above the north door, then cross your new bridge and go through
the exit at the southwest.

Kill the enemies in this room, then circle around to the northwest corner to
hit a ? block containing 50 coins. Then, go back to the southwest corner and
get the Shell. Go back to the block you just passed hovering above the water
and send Mario into it with the hammer for 100 more coins. Then, hit the !
block on the east side of the area to light up the second light. Go through the
northeast exit.

Grab the Shell from the block, and hit the switch to make a bridge back to the
main part of the room. Go back to the three switches on the east side of the
area and hit all of them to rotate the bridges so you can get to the last !
block. Hit it, then go through the door that opens to the north.

Save at the Save Block, then talk to the Toads to the north. Surprise! They are
actually Fawflants! Defeat them, then watch the cutscene. When it's over, go up
the path to the east to get up to 100 coins from the block. Go west.

Hop up the platforms and Spin Jump across the gap to get to a pair of blocks
that contain a Star Candy and up to 50 coins. Then, go back to the east and
head through the open door to the north.

There are two ? blocks in this room. The one on the west contains 2 Super
Mushrooms and the one on the east has 50 coins. Grab them, and head north.

This room has a lot of ? blocks. Hit the block above the platform to the east
for 50 coins, then hop up the platforms to the north and Spin Jump across to
the tall, eastern platform and hit the block there for 50 more. Spin Jump back,
then Spin Jump into the gap in the wall and hit the block for a Supersyrup jar.
Spin Jump out of the gap and go to the platform to the west. Repeat the process
in the next gap for another Supersyrup Jar from the block in there, then Spin
Jump back out and go to the next west platform. Cross the gap to the far
western platform and hit the ? blocks there for 100 coins and a pair of Coin
Socks.

===New Gear====================================================================

Coin Socks: Increases the coins earned in battle by 50% if the wearer takes no
            damage during the fight.

===============================================================================

Finally, go east.

The 2 blocks above the ramp at the east end of this area contain a total of 60
coins. After you get them, go through the pipe to get to the main part of Toad
Town.


---(5.7 The Hunt For a Cure)---------------------------------------------------


Coming soon!


---(6. Attack List)------------------------------------------------------------


---(6.1 Mario / Luigi)---------------------------------------------------------


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Jump:
This is a basic jump attack. Press the action button just before landing to
deal extra damage and initiate a second jump. Press the action button again
just before landing a second time to stomp and do even more damage.
***CAUTION***
Jumping on enemies that use their heads to damage you will do no damage to the
enemy. Instead, you will receive 1 HP of damage!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hammer:
This is a basic hammer attack. After you select your target, Mario or Luigi
will run up to it and begin charging their strike. Press the action button to
make them strike when the hammer is at full power, but don't wait too long or
the hammer's head will fall off and you won't do much damage. This attack is
useful for attacking enemies that can't be harmed by jumping. The Hammer may
inflict dizzy status on your foes.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Green Shell:
Mario and Luigi will kick a Green Shell back and forth between them. Press the
A or B Button as the shell gets close to Mario or Luigi to make them kick it
again and deal more damage! Acquired in Trash Pit. Requires 3 SP per use.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fire Flower:
Mario and Luigi will each get a Fire Flower and fireballs. Press the button of
the brother with the big fireball to make him throw fire at random enemies.
At the end of the attack, Mario and Luigi may both have big fireballs, so press
A and B together repeatedly for masive damage. Acquired in Pump Works. Requires
4 SP per use. This attack may inflict burn status.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Jump Helmet:
Luigi will wear a springboard helmet, and Mario will jump on it. Move Luigi
so he is under Mario, and press A as Mario lands to power the attack up. Press
A again as Mario lands on the enemy to do massive damage. Acquired in Flab
Zone. Requires 6 SP per use. As with other jumping attacks, you should not use
this against enemies that use their head to attack.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yoo Who Cannon:
A bunch of barrels will fall down, and Mario and Luigi will pop out of them.
Memorize their positions! As the barrels lift, press the button of the Brother
that's in the barrel.

To make memorization easier, only pay attention to the Brother with the easier
to remember pattern. If a barrel lifts that doesn't match the pattern, press
the other button!

This attack costs 7 SP per use.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


---(6.2 Bowser)----------------------------------------------------------------


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Punch:
Bowser will walk toward the enemy and begin charging a punch. Press X as he
finishes charging to punch the enemy with full strength. If you overcharge,
though, Bowser will fall on the enemy and not do much damage.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Vacuum:
Bowser will try to inhale any enemy onscreen. Press X to make him inhale
better. Most enemies can not be inhaled, but the Vacuum Block will flash when
you have an opportunity. This can be used to collect Blitties, but the Vacuum
Block won't give you any hints about those.

If an enemy is inhaled, it will be sent to fight the Mario Brothers in Bowser's
gut.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Flame:
Bowser will begin charging his flame breath. When he is at full charge, press
and hold X to make him spit it at the enemy. This is an attack that hits all
the enemies on the bottom screen, and it has the potential to inflict burn
status. The longer X is held down, the more damage the flame will deal.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Goomba Storm:
Goombas will rush toward the specified enemy. Light them on fire by tapping
them with the stylus to power them up! Acquired in Dimble Wood. Requires 6 SP
per use. May inflict burn status.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Shy Guy Squad:
A bunch of Shy Guys will appear and use rubber-band action to launch the
ball-morphed Bowser into an enemy. Slide the stylus across Bowser from right to
left while they are readying the attack to power it up. Acquired in Bowser
Path. Requires 8 SP per use.

            If this attack is successfully completed, a new Flifit will be
            born.

Sneed Spit: The Flifit will spit a Sneed onto the ground. The Sneed will bounce
            toward Bowser, so duck to avoid damage. This attack makes a
            different sound than Sneed Shot, so pay attention to tell what will
            happen.

             it, you will have to destroy each part separately. Then, you will
             have to destroy the core Beta Kretin.

             During the Alpha Kretin stage, the orange ones can only be harmed
             by Mario. The green ones can only be defeated by Luigi. The colors
             will change as they take damage.

             In the Beta Kretin stage, there will be one true Beta Kretin and
             several fakes. Pay attention to the real one, since fighting the
             fakes is a waste of time. After a few turns, the Beta Kretin may
             reform into another Alpha Kretin. If it does, you will have to
             repeat the Alpha Kretin Stage.

Attacks: Alpha Kretin-

Energy Ball: The Alpha Kretin will fire balls of energy at Mario and Luigi. Pay
             attention to the order that the initial ball of light moves in,

             targeted in. This attack can cause DEF Down status.

Attacks: Beta Kretin-

Lightning Bolt: The Beta Kretin will multiply itself and fire lightning bolts
                back and forth between itself and the other Beta Kretins. When
                one jumps, that means it will be fired at by the last one to
                be hit. Jump over the bolts!

EXP:   N/A
Coins: N/A
Drops: N/A

Description: Midbus is Fawful's right-hand pig. In this fight, he basically
             gets to (sort of) teach Bowser how to fight. There is no way to 
             win the fight, so just deflect his attacks and deal damage until
             it ends.

Attacks-

Roll:          Midbus will roll toward Bowser. Quickly press X as he gets close
               to punch him and knock him back.

               slam Bowser from above. There is no way to dodge this in this

Attacks-

Mushroom:      Broque Monsieur will hit a ? block and a mushroom will pop out.
               He will then recover 30 HP. Sometimes, he will step the wrong
               way and the Mushroom will go to Bowser instead.

Mega Mushroom: Broque Monsieur will eat a Mega Mushroom and charge into you.
               Punch him as he gets close, and his body will fly away. Take
               this opportunity to hit his head repeatedly for free coins!

Coin Block:    Broque Monsieur will punch a ? block like he does for his other
               attacks, but sometimes he will just get a coin instead of a

             Beach. It takes no damage from attacks to its body, but the Stone
             Blooper on its head is vulnerable. Inhale it as Bowser, then
             fight it as the Mario Bros.

Attacks: Sea Pipe Statue-

Blooper Shot: The Sea Pipe Statue will point its arm toward Bowser and fire the
              Stone Blooper at him. Punch as the Blooper emerges to knock it
              back!

Blooper Lob:  The Sea Pipe Statue will point its arm above Bowser's head and
              fire the Stone Blooper out of it. The Stone Blooper will then fly
              over Bowser's head and reappear on the other side of the screen;
              where it will make a slow descent toward Bowser. Punch it as it
              gets close!

Attacks: Stone Blooper-

Drill:  The Stone Blooper will turn itself upside down and drill into Bowser,
        damaging him. There is nothing you can do to stop or counter this.

Drop:   The Stone Blooper will jump a few times and try to land on the head of
        Mario or Luigi. Hit it with a hammer to avoid damage!

             Broque Monsieur, he will drop a coin each time he is hit.

Attacks-

Pounce: Broggy will leap high in the air and try to land on Bowser. Then, he
        will make a second attack from behind. Duck into your shell to dodge
        the first attack, then listen for eight beats before ducking to avoid
        the second part.

Charge: Broggy will lean forward, then charge at Bowser. Punch him to counter!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wiggler

Wiggler EXP:    340
Wiggler Coins:  150
Leaf Guy HP:    57
Leaf Guy EXP:   20
Leaf Guy Coins: 0

Drops: 1-Up Deluxe

Description: Wiggler is angry about that giga-carrot! Before you can deal any
             damage, you will need to turn each body segment yellow. Do this by
             attacking each segment, then turn loose Bowser's power on
             Wiggler's face. Occasionally, a couple of Leaf Guys will appear on
             the top screen. Vacuum them to send them to the Bros and turn
             Wiggler yellow.

Attacks: Wiggler-

Grow 'N Throw: Wiggler will pull out a watering can and water the ground. Then,
               he will pull what grows out and throw them at you. If he throws
               a Leaf Guy, duck. If he throws a turnip, punch.

CHARGE!:       Wiggler will rush toward Bowser. As he approaches, punch him 3
               times. Then, duck to finish the evasion.

Round & Round: Wiggler will run around Bowser in a circle. Punch his flashing
               face to send him away. If you don't, he will charge into Bowser
               after 6 circles. You can use this attack as an opportunity to
               change Wiggler's body segments yellow if you time your attacks
               right.

Attacks: Leaf Guy-

Turnip Drop:   This is the only attack they will use against Bowser. If you
               don't inhale them, they will drop a giant turnip on him. There
               is no way to dodge this.

Copter:        The Leaf Guys will fly toward the Brothers. Hit them with the
               hammers!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Midbus

HP:    950
EXP:   550
Coins: 300
Drops: TNT Drumstick

Description: This is no tutorial battle. This time, Midbus means business. The
             fight takes place in front of a live audience. The audience will
             reward well done hits and dodges with powerups. If they give food
             to Midbus, vacuum it away to heal yourself and keep him from
             recovering. If you vacuum a ham, you will get POW Up status.

Attacks-

Ball & Chain:  Midbus will diasappear offscreen and reappear swinging a ball
               and chain. As he nears you, duck! Midbus will step back. Then,
               he will throw the ball at Bowser. If it goes low, punch it. If
               it goes high, duck.

Bouncing Slam: This is the same attack he used to end the last fight you had
               with him. This time, however, it can be blocked! If he lands in
               front of you, punch him before he hits the ground. If he comes
               down on top of you, duck. You can tell where he will land by
               watching the top screen as he jumps.

Wind Up:       Midbus will inhale air and walk toward Bowser. After a set
               amount of time, he will unleash an uppercut. To stop this, punch
               him repeatedly! After you stop the attack, punch him again as he
               bounces toward you to deal damage to him.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


---(11. Mini Games)------------------------------------------------------------


There are several mini games in Bowser that you will have to play to power him
up throughout the game. They are listed here along with tips for how to win
them.

Although the Giant Bowser fights are technically boss battles, I have listed
them here since they are so mini game-ish.


---(11.1 Inside Bowser)--------------------------------------------------------


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Arm Center:
This is a rhythm-type game where Mario and Luigi have to hit balls of light
with their hammers. Mario hits the orange balls, Luigi hits the green ones. The
balls have to be hit in the order they are fired, and the orange ones make a
different sound from the green ones. Pay attention to the order, and you should
be fine.

The first time you play this game, however, you will only bounce a single ball
of light back and forth. It will change color periodically, so be sure to hit
it with the right Bro!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Gut Check:
You will only play this game once. Bowser will eat chunks of carrot, and you
need to tap them with the stylus to break them up. There is a 1-minute time
limit, so work quickly! If you tap a chunk and a circle appears, tap it to
break up several other chunks.

Keep an eye on the top screen when Bowser is eating. When Bowser's mouth
flashes, remember which chunk falls. That chunk will contain a super-enzyme
that will break up a lot of carrot!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rump Command:
You will need to play this game any time that Bowser is about to die out of
battle. Basically, you will shoot colored balls as Mario and Luigi aboard the
Boats of Revival. Mario shoots the red, Luigi shoots the green. If you shoot
one with the wrong Brother, the ball will rocket toward you. Your boats can
only take three hits before they go down, so watch out!

Occasionally, you will see a large, blue ball. Shoot it with both Brothers!

When the meter is filled, you will have to shoot a huge blue ball. This one
will shoot back at you, so be careful! You can repel the shots by shooting them
with the appropriate Brother.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Leg Outpost:
This is kind of like the Spin Pipe special move. Mario and Luigi will spin
around in the air and land on Bowser's muscles. Press the button of the Bro on
the bottom to stomp and power Bowser up. Hold the button in for a bit for more
power. If Mario and Luigi split up, press both buttons to stomp both muscles.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


---(11.2 Giant Bowser)---------------------------------------------------------


Bowser will turn giant at certain points in the game. When he does, he will
have to take on some giant enemies. When he does, you will need to turn the DS
on it's side. Here's how to play as him.

Before I go into detail about specific fights, I'll list some basic moves.

Punch:       This is one of Bowser's basic attacks. Slide the stylus quickly
             from the left side of the screen to the right. This may also be
             used in defense.

Flame:       Another of Bowser's basic attacks. Inhale until you get the
             message to blow, then blow air into the mic as long as you can
             until the attack ends. Stay at your current distance from the
             screen. If you get too close, the sound may not be read correctly.

Fireball:    This is only used in defense. Enemies will fly toward Bowser. Tap
             the screen to fire at them! Don't fire too quickly, though. If you
             do, the fireballs will be too small to do any damage.

Refreshroom: If you collect a Refreshroom in battle, you can use it to recover
             half of your health.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bowser's Castle

This is Bowser's Fawfulized castle. Punches and Flames do the same amount of
damage to it, so use whatever you are most comfortable with.

EXP:   380
Coins: 200
Drops: Star Candy

Attacks-

Slam:            The Castle will fly towards Bowser and try to slam into him.
                 Punch it and deflect!

Shy Guy Copters: Several Shy Guy Copters will fly out of the castle. They will
                 shoot at Bowser with metal balls. Shoot them down with
                 fireballs!

Spiny Shield:    Several Spinies will come out of the castle and sit in front
                 of it. You won't be able to punch it while they are there.
                 Use Flame breath to burn them!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


---(12. Optional Stuff)--------------------------------------------------------


The stuff listed here is, for the most part, optional. You will automatically

---(12.4 Cholesteroad Challenges)----------------------------------------------

Before I list any of these, I need to make a disclaimer. The challenges in here
are TOUGH! They are not necessary for beating the game, and I am not
responsible for any damage done to you, your game system, your surroundings, or
anything else if you attempt them. You have been warned.

---(12.4.1 Endless Mode)-------------------------------------------------------

General Endless Mode Tips:

#1: Don't look at the score counter!
#2: Don't look at the Cholesterons!
#3: As the pace increases, so will your pulse. Don't panic!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Green Shell

B Rank: 100, Prize: 50 Coins
A Rank: 150, Prize: 250 Coins + Challenge Medal

Tips: This is your first Cholesteroad challenge, but don't expect it to be
      easy! As with all of them, a single miss = fail. Kick the shell when it
      gets to Mario or Luigi, never before. The rhythm will slowly build up
      speed as time goes on, but you can do it if you stay focused.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yoo Who Cannon

B Rank: 80,  Prize: 100 Coins
A Rank: 120, Prize: 500 Coins + Bro Socks

Tips: This challenge could either be easy for you or hard depending on how fast
      your eyes are. At the later stages, the Bros will pop out of the barrels
      as fast as a flicker of light and you won't have time to memorize them
      individually.

      Pay attention to one character. Watch for the one that has the pattern
      that is easiest to follow. If a barrel raises from that pattern, hold the
      button of the Bro inside. If a barrel raises from outside that pattern,
      hold the other button.

      Don't wait for the barrel to finish raising before pressing the button!
      At the later stages, you will only have 0.05 seconds to press the button
      once the barrel finishes rising. Hold the button as it starts to rise.

      Don't try to guess which barrel will rise next. If you do, you will find
      yourself pressing the wrong button!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


---(12.4.2 Juuuuump Mode)------------------------------------------------------


This is the Jump Helmet's Cholesteroad Challenge. Use the Jump Helemt to try to
advance as far as possible! Grab the red timers to increase time, avoid the
blue ones because they decrease time. If you can find a yellow timer, time will
freeze and the blue timers will disappear for a bit.

B Rank: 30, Prize: 100 Coins
A Rank: 60, Prize: 500 Coins + Daredevil Boots

Tips: Don't worry too much about the timer. You are a lot more likely to fail
      from missing a jump than you are from running out of time. You can
      control how high or far Mario jumps by moving Luigi under him. If Mario
      lands on the back of the platform, he will fly high into the air. If he
      lands on the front, he will jump far forward. Use this information in
      combination with pressing the A button to gather red timers and avoid
      blue ones.

      Keep your focus on Mario, not Luigi. Once you get the hang of things, you
      will move Luigi almost by instinct. You NEED to know where Mario is,
      though.

      Unlike other challenges, this one doesn't speed up or get much harder as
      time goes on. Just stay calm and hang in there. You will get the A rank
      if you can endure.


---(12.4.3 99 Block)-----------------------------------------------------------


OK, so this isn't really a Cholesteroad Challenge. It's equally frustrating,
though, so I'm putting it here.

The 99 Block is located on the top floor of the Challenge Node after you clear
the Flab Zone. It's similar to the block challenges in that area, but it
challenges you to hit it 99 times. This is a LOT harder than it sounds, but you
will be rewarded with the ability to double your coins once you complete it.
The coin doubling doesn't have to be done immediately after clearing the
challenge, and it only works once. Save it for when you have a lot of coins to
get a lot more!

One of the most important things to remember about the 99 Block is that Luigi
is taller than Mario. You will need to make him jump slightly later than Mario
does. The speed will continue to increase throughout the challenge. As it does,
your pulse will probably speed up as well. Try to stay calm and focus on the
timing. Try to time your jumps so that the block is hit by your fist, not your
head.

After the block hits about 75 it won't speed up any more. At this point, it's
all about how calm you can stay and how well you can keep up the rhythm. It's
bery easy to jump early at this stage, but don't do it!

If you find yourself frustrated at this, take a deep breath and take a break
from it. You can do it with enough practice and patience, but don't stress
yourself.

When you finally win, treat yourself to a soda or something. You've earned it.
