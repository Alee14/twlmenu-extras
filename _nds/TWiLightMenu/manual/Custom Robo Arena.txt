3.) Walkthrough
----------------------------------------

Start up your game and enter the name you want to be called.  You'll start off
in a battle against a huge tank.  Don't worry, you can't beat him, yet.  After
you die, you'll see a figure roll out of bed. That's you.  When you get dressed
walk out of your room to talk with Tamara, your older sister.  Walk downstairs
for more talking. Yay!  Talk to Dad for your first custom robo, a Ray Mk II.
You'll also get the Basic Gun, Standard Bomb, Standard Pod, and Standard Legs
parts.  Replace these parts as soon as possible, as they are the most basic
parts.  Dad will then give you a Garage to customize your robo in, along with a
cloth to clean your robo and its parts.  You'll also get a Cell Phone.  Now eat
your breakfast you hungry little piggy.  Answer yes to the question.  Walk
outside for your first day of Custom Robo.

========
Day # 1
========

You should walk to Midheart High, your new school, but if you want to invade
other people's homes, go right ahead.  I'll wait for you. Dum dum dum, de de 
bop.  Done? Good, lets go to >gulp< school.  As soon as you walk in, CUTSCENE!
DS visuals are getting better.  Anyway, walk straight through the big glass
doors to the clerk and talk to her.  You'll get your School ID Badge and a 
School Map.  Walk down the hall to the right and talk to the dude in the blue
suit.  This is Mr. Stubbs, one of your teachers.  He introduces you to the
class and tells you to sit next to Dennis.  After class is over, go talk to 
Dennis and tell him that your interested in Custom Robo.  He'll leave, and so 
should you.  Walk to Midheart's entrance and you'll see Liv and Dennis talking
with Bull, the school's best commander.  After their heated argument, talk to
Liv and tell her that you want to fight for Team Numero Uno.  Then you'll have
to do an eye-scan registration for your Ray Mk II.  Touch the red part of the
cube, and then spin the robo.  Touch the indicated spot on the Ray, and make
sure you make eye contact.  Wait, you didn't!  Now hows it gonna listen to you!
Nevermind.  After that comes your first fight, with Terry.  Terry!  Man I can't
believe it, Terry.  Go talk to the kid tossing his robo cube and you'll fight.

Battle # 1 - Terry

Body - Pike
Gun -  Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod -  Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Total NOOB.  Just tap battle and get ready. This is an easy battle

Bull gets mad and challenges you, but Stubbs stops him.  Tell Dennis you'll
join the team, and then they will bring you to Team Numero Uno's clubhouse.

Battle # 2 - Dennis

Body - Mantis
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

No wonder Team Numero Uno stinks, look at this kid.  Anyway, just beat him.

After the battle, Liv will give you some new parts.  They are Flame Gun,
Tomahawk Bomb B, Twin Flank Pod F, and High Jump Legs.  She brings in two other
commanders for you to fight

Battle # 3 - Girl

Body - Amy
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Standard Legs

Time to customize!  Tap Garage and you'll be brought to none other than your
garage.  What a surprise.  Here you should change your legs to the High Jump
Legs, your pod to the Twin Flank Pod F, the bomb to the Tomahawk Bomb B, and
the gun to the Flame Gun.  Don't forget that you can test fire your parts by
hitting the R button.  Hit Start to battle.  This is another easy battle.  Liv
will give you more parts.  The 3-Way Gun (0ne of my personal favorites), the
Straight Bomb G, and the Reflection Pod.

Battle # 4 - Boy

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Its up to you whether or not to customize.  I chose to change to the 3-Way Gun,
but thats because its one of my favorites.  Its also good to test out new parts
against easy characters.  Another easy battle, thanks to the extreme slow speed
that is known as Seal Kid.  Liv will now give you the Vertical Gun, Gemini Bomb
B, and the Cockroach Pod H.

Battle # 5 - Mr. Stubbs

Body - Borane
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Speed Pod D
Legs - Standard Legs

Don't forget to clean your robo when it gets dirty.  If it gets too dirty, then
you will lose performance.  Stubbs' robo is very big, so its a very easy
target but try to keep it on the ground.  His robo is much more maneuverable
in the air.

Walk out of school and then Liv and Dennis will ask to see your house.  Say
yes and they will show you their houses.  Walk to your seat from breakfast and
prepare for some good old cooking from Momma.  You'll be seeing this scene
quite often, so get used to it.  After dinner is done, Tamara will go to her
room, and you should do the same.  No, don't go into her room, into yours.  Oh
man.  She's your sister!  Time for night-night.

========
Day # 2
========

Eat your breakfast and walk outside and go to school.  There will be a few robo
battlers in school.  Its up to you whether or not to fight them, but they're
good for extra cash and experience, so I will battle them for you.  Well, not
really.

Battle # 6 - Boy (In Front Yard)

Body - Mantis
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Battle # 7 - Girl (Front of clubhouse)

Body - Amy
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Standard Legs

Battle # 8 - Boy (Front of classroom)

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

You can get a video chip by pressing A on the highest book shelf in the main
entrance of school.  Go to the menu and open your notes. Then open movies and
you can watch it  Go sit through class and meet Dennis and Liv at the front
gate.  You will be going to the Robocenter for some battling.  You'll meet
Tanya, who will give you your Commander's Band.  Then you'll meet Dickie, who 
wants to battle you.  But, you have to go through some other battles, before 
you go to face Dickie and his jeans.

Battle # 9 - Girl (Top right corner)

Body - Luna
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Formula Legs

She's not too tough, just fast.  As long as you can keep getting her down, her
speed won't be a problem.

Battle # 10 - Boy (Top left corner)

Body - Hurricane
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Standard Legs

Watch out for this one.  The Hurricane robo transforms during its second jump.
It is still able to fire in this mode, so watch out.  It will transform back
to normal when it lands.  Otherwise, this is an easy battle.

Battle # 11 - Boy (Bottom left corner)

Body - Fogey
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

This robo is very maneuverable in the air, but much less so on the ground.
Keep him out of the air, as he is hard to hit there.

Battle # 12 - Dickie

Body - Oracle
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Standard Legs

Dickie hits hard and fast, so do the same.  He isn't too hard though, but
probably the best you have faced so far.  Just watch out for his bomb, since
it will fly from his right and force you to move.

Tanya will show up and give you a Checklist.  This is for seeing all the
mission battles.  And you will finally be able to visit the parts shop.  You
should buy as much as you can, just make sure you only get one or two good guns
because they are expensive.  Two good parts that you should buy are the Formula
Legs and the Satellite Pod.  The Satellite Pod is definitely my favorite pod,
but choose what you want and test fire before you buy it.  Remember one
strategy doesn't always work for everyone.  Talk to Liv or Dennis to get going.
They will want to hang out at your house, so let them.  Don't be shy, introduce
them.  After that, eat your dinner and go sleep

========
Day # 3
========

The day of the big tournament.  Head to school and go to the clubhouse.  Talk
to Liv and she'll tell you to meet her in the main hall.  Talk to Dennis, and
then Liv will arrive.  Head left and talk to Mr. Stubbs.  You can't leave the
room until all the battles are done.  Get ready for your battle. ...Nnnnow!

Battle # 13 - Girl

Body - Amy
Gun - Afterburner Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Jumping Pod G
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

Clean up your robo if you need to.  This course has a sinking center so watch
it.  If you hit the magma, then you will get down, and your robo will get dirty
so make sure you keep away from the center.  And everyone hates a dirty robo.

Battle # 14 - Warren

Body - Metal Ape
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Left Flank Bomb H
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

This battle is actually kinda tough.  Warren's Metal Ape robo has high defense
and it increases the power of the parts that he equips.  You may want to use
a strong gun to compensate for the defense, but you really should exploit his
speed, or lack of it.

Battle # 15 - Terry

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Flame Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Throwing Pod D
Legs - Standard Legs

Heyyy, Terry's back and just as bad as ever.  In fact, its so easy, I almost
got perfect health without even trying.

Battle # 16 - Bull

Body - Rock Hound
Gun - Drill Gun
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb B
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

You finally face Bull.  Watch out for his Drill Gun, its a monster.  If it hits
you, it will pull you closer to him, so watch out.  It just lets him hit you
even more.  His Rock Hound is in the group that Warren's Metal Ape was.  His
defense is high, and his power is increased.  As long as you can combo him,
he won't be too hard.

Thats it.  You won.  You beat the entire game.  Now time to throw it away.  Nah
just kidding.  We got a lot more ahead of us.  You get the Tournament Award.
Tell Dennis you're ready, and then walk all the way left to NeoBrain, where
your sister and dad both work.  Talk to the receptionist, and then head
upstairs and talk to that receptionist.  Press A on the elevator and look
around the building.  See the kid with blue hair in the left room.  Yeah.  Well
remember his face, because you'll face him soon enough.  Talk to Liv, Dennis,
and then Kindjal, the purple-haired scientist.  Head to Pop Pop after you do
this.  Then get ready to face the computer, bum bum bum, bom bom. >Weird 
ominous music sounds<

Battle # 17 - Computer

Body - Pike
Gun - Flame Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

Be prepared for this battle.  The Pike model disappears when it jumps, so it is
good at avoiding shots.  Get close up and combo the heck out of it.  It is
strong so watch out for his shots.

Follow the dinner time routine and then sleep.

=======
Day # 4
=======

Head straight up into the central district.  Then go into the top-left house in
the section of 3 houses.  Talk to the guy in there and he will ask if you want
to help clean his robos.  Say yes and clean it as fast as you can.  You will
get some money for doing this.  You can do this 3 times a day.  It will get
easier when you can buy super cloths, which clean much faster.  It is a good
way to make some money.  Make sure you do it every day. Head to Midheart and 
fight the guy near the park.

Battle # 18 - Man

Body - Hurricane
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Standard Legs

He's got the Hurricane robo, so remember about his special transformation in 
the air.

Now head to school for more battling action.  Answer yes to the Chef's
question.

Battle # 19 - Chef

Body - Borane
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Speed Pod D
Legs - Standard Legs

Nothing special.  Head into Bull's team room to face the beast.

Battle # 20 - Bull

Body - Rock Hound
Gun - Drill Gun
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb B
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Crush him again.  You're better.

Go to the Cafeteria and talk to the boy in the red shirt in the lower-left.
He'll give you a video chip.  Head on back towards your class.  Face the kid.

Battle # 21 - Boy

Body - Mantis
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Standard Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

This kid stole Dennis' robo!  He has the same (horrible) parts.  PWN him just
like you did to Dennis the first day you met him.  Then head to class.

After class go to the clubhouse and listen to Dennis ranting about things.  He
heads off to Midheart's rival school Forester Prep.  Leave school and head
right to meet up with Dennis.  Dennis will show you Forester, so go there.
Go into the building on the left once inside of Forester to see Liv surrounded
by Forester kids.  Now you have to fight a Forester kid.

Battle # 22 - Boy

Body - Fogey
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb D
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

Remember that Fogey has horrible ground movement.  Keep that in mind and win.

Then, uh-oh!  Serene shows up. But she sorts everything out.  She is the best
commander at Forester, and knows a dark secret.  Well, its not really dark,
just good.  She knows the secret of SOULBOOST!  Dun dun dun.  Leave here and
go to the Robocenter.  Talk to Dickie, and he will tell you a little about
Soulboost.  Tanya will try to find the video of the battle where Soulboost was
used.  In the mean time, battle Dickie.

Battle # 23 - Dickie

Body - Oracle
Gun - Afterburner Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Cockroach Pod G
Legs - Standard Legs

Watch out for his Afterburner Gun.  It will quickly annoy you.  Otherwise, he
isn't hard.

Tanya will come back with the chip, but you are going to have to battle it from
her.

Battle # 24 - Tanya

Body - Swift
Gun - Vertical Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Dolphin Pod
Legs - Ground Legs

Prepare for this battle.  She pilots the Swift well.  But you should exploit
the Swift's low defense to no end.  She will almost always be running, so you
must trap her into a corner and unload all of your firepower.

Now you got the Soulboost video chip.  Oooh, powerful.  Go home.

========
Day # 5
========

Dennis comes to pick you up, but you end up walking him.  Whatever.  Head to
Forester for the tournament.  While Dennis and Liv and waiting at Forester,
go back to central district.  Go into the parts store and talk to the robot in
the corner.  It sells super cloths, which clean much better.  Buy 10 of them
and go to the robo polish guy for some extra cash.  Go back to Forester and
talk to everyone.  They will then finish preparing for the contest.  So talk
to Liv and go into the building.  Dennis is up first, but of course he loses.
Show them Foresters how its really done and win.

Battle # 25 - Girl

Body - Amy
Gun - Hornet Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Speed Pod D
Legs - High Jump Legs

The Hornet Gun is another really annoying gun.  It shoots out 5 bees and they
home onto you.  They are REALLY ANNOYING.  But it doesn't have a long range,
so exploit that with bombs and pods.  Then when she goes down, combo the snot
out of her.

Battle # 26 - Boy

Body - Fogey
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Keep in mind that he has Satellite Pods.  These pods stay in the air until
your enemy comes to close to them and they explode.  Just exploit his low
ground maneuverability and he should go down easily.

Battle # 27 - Serene

Body - Miranda
Gun - Scorpion Gun
Bomb - Wave Bomb
Pod - Cockroach Pod G
Legs - Formula Legs

Watch for her Soulboost.  It increases her speed, power, and defense among
other things.  A little cutscene will happen when she activates Soulboost.  She
will turn gold.  The best thing to do is to stay far away from her attacks, as
they will easily down you.  Once her Soulboost is over, her robo will turn
black and respond just like an extremely dirty robo.  Then is your chance to
unload all of you power.

After the battle, the Bayside (other high school) Super Novas will come in.
Lunax is the "leader".  They will introduce themselves to you.  They want to
fight you in 4 days.  Lunax asks Serene if she Soulboost from Stark on Mt.
Zephyr.  Heh, heh.  Time to go to Mt. Zephyr.

Head up to Mt. Zephyr and you will see a police officer.  Don't worry, he's
good.  Head up the mountain.

Battle # 28 - Police

Body - Metal Ape
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Jumping Pod B
Legs - High Jump Legs

Don't get careless and run into his fire.  Use a powerful gun to counter his
defense.  Otherwise he is an average commander.

Then you'll see another officer who says you must battle someone before you go
see Stark.  Left is weak, middle is average, and the right is the strongest.
Take the right path.  But if you want an easier challenge, go left or middle.

Battle # 29 - Police (Right)

Body - Luna
Gun - Hornet Gun
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Formula Legs

Annoying Hornet Gun, but win anyway.  She's not too hard.

Battle # 29 - Police (Middle)

Body - Robin
Gun - Vertical Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Dolphin Pod G
Legs - Ground Legs

Not too hard.  He's just average.  The Robin is very fast, but has no defense.

Battle # 29 - Police (Left)

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Left Spike Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb P
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Well, they didn't lie.  He is easy.

Whichever one you battled, head straight up the mountain.  You'll meet Stark, 
Shipley, and Winchell.  Stark denies and you have to go home.  Duncan will
visit your house after dinner.  He is a police officer.  He and Tamara know 
each other from school.  He asks for a battle after class in the Robocenter
tomorrow.  Whoo!  Good night.

========
Day # 6
========

Head to Central District.

Battle # 30 - Man

Body - Oracle
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Standard Legs

Not hard.  Move on to cleaning robos, then head into Hillside for another
battle.  She is next to the lake.

Battle # 31 - Girl

Body - Luna
Gun - Basic Gun
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Formula Legs

Easy.

Go to school.  In front of your class will be another challenger.

Battle # 32 - Boy

Body - Pike
Gun - Flame Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

Easy.

Then head to class. After class, go to the Robocenter.  Tanya has a present for
you, but you have to wait.  POOP!  I hate waiting.  Go inside and talk to
Duncan.  He'll get ready to fight.  But first we have others to take care of.

Battle # 33 - Boy (Lower-left corner)

Body - Metal Ape
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Left Flank Bomb H
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

Not hard at all.  Go to Duncan.

Battle # 34 - Duncan

Body - Klimt
Gun - Vertical Gun
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

He's not too bad.

But then a little girl comes in.  She is Serene's little sister Polly.

Battle # 35 - Polly

Body - Nano
Gun - Slide Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Jumping Pod B
Legs - Ground Legs

Another low defense robo.  Unleash the fury within and WIN!!!!

After this, Dennis and Liv come in.  Along with Duncan's boss Kris.  Duncan
and Kris then leave to respond to criminal activity.  Tanya will show up, but
she wants a battle for the gift.  Get ready.

Battle # 36 - Tanya

Body - Swift
Gun - Right Spike Gun
Bomb - Left Flank Bomb H
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Formula Legs

A tough battle.  Watch out for her dash and other powerful attacks.

She'll give you the Robocade Key.  The Robocade are all battles against
computers.  Thats your surprise.  But its worth it to check it out later. Now,
its sleepy time.

========
Day # 7
========

Get up and go to class.  Liv and Dennis want to tag along with you to NeoBrain
also.  But first, TEST!!!  Its really easy.  Don't worry, here are the answers.

Head to Bull's team room, Duncan is waiting for you there.  Talk to him, and
Liv will talk him into letting you walk with Duncan while he's on patrol later.
Walk on towards the front gate, and your dad will call you.  Keep on going.
Stubbs comes over and makes Liv and Dennis stay after school. HAH HAH.  Sorry.
Head on over to NeoBrain's 2nd floor receptionist.  After you talk to her and
walk to the elevator, Liv and Dennis show up.  Go and see your Pops in his lab.

Battle # 37 - Computer

Body - Hurricane
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Divide Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Much harder than last time.  Watch out for his deadly combos, and you should be
fine.

After the battle, the President of NeoBrain, Dr. Kindjal, and Dr. Mars show up.
You'll finally get a new robo, the Ray Mk III.  Do the eye-scan registration,
and get ready to destroy your sister.

Battle # 38 - Tamara

Body - Comet
Gun - Thunderbolt Gun
Bomb - Straight Bomb G
Pod - Dolphin Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Not too bad ... for a girl. HAH, just kidding.  She isn't too tough.

Leave NeoBrain and head towards the giant clock tower in Central District.
Talk to Duncan and he will explain illegal parts.  He'll take you to the back
of Central District, and you'll see some weird dude named Marv with his pet
bird Cheepers.  He is easy, but he seems to be the only enemy who doesn't have
fully polished parts.  

Battle # 39 - Marv

Body - Gigantron
Gun - Blade Gun
Bomb - Charge Bomb
Pod - Jumping Pod B
Legs - High Jump Legs

Easy.

Duncan will walk down towards the Robocenter.  Two criminals show up, but the
important one is named Cleaver.  Duncan fights the criminal, but gets hit by a
stray round from the enemy's robo.  This is because they aren't fighting in a
Holosseum, they're fighting in the real world. Duncan is down, so you have to
take over.  REMEMBER, THERE IS NO ROBO CANNON TO LAUNCH YOU IN REAL WORLD
BATTLES.

Battle # 40 - Criminal

Body - Zola
Gun - Meteor Storm Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Speed Pod D
Legs - Standard Legs

Watch out, remember there is no robo cannon.  He is a pretty good commander.
Just remember to win, and you should win.

In Police HQ, Kris will come over and she is angry.  Liv turned off the
security lock and thats illegal.  But, she'll let you off the hook, and plus
she'll give you the "Intro Letter" that will make Stark listen.  Cool.  Sleep.

========
Day # 8
========

Battle time.  Head to the right side of Midheart and face the boy under Liv's.

Battle # 41 - Boy (Midheart)

Body - Pike
Gun - Flame Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

He is easy, so head up to the park, and on the left, there should be a girl.
Polish your robo fully.  She'll only battle a fully clean robo.

Battle # 42 - Girl (Midheart)

Body - Amy
Gun - Meteor Storm Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb S
Pod - Diving Pod
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

She is pretty tough, so save if you want before you battle her.  I guess Amy
and Meteor Storm Gun is a good combination.  You win a Super Cloth for beating
her.

Head into the upper left of Harbor District to fight another person.

Battle # 43 - Man (Harbor)

Body - Fogey
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Submarine Pod D
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

Another Fogey.  They're easy.

Head on up into Central District, and fight the boy there.

Battle # 44 - Boy (Central)

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Left Spike Gun
Bomb - Submarine Pod D
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Another Seal Kid.  Just let this be a reminder to you when you can buy extra
bodies.  Seal Kid stink.  REEEAALLY badly.

Head into the Robocenter and talk to Tanya at the counter, she'll battle you.

Battle # 45 - Tanya

Body - Swift
Gun - Right Spike Gun
Bomb - Left Flank Bomb H
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Formula Legs

Tanya, still just as good as ever.  You've beaten her before, do it again.

Head up into the Holosseums and fight the boy there.

Battle # 46 - Boy (Robocenter)

Body - Oracle
Gun - Afterburner Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Cockroach Pod G
Legs - Standard Legs

Think of Dickie's parts, just with a worse commander.  Weird, he's your fan,
but he's using Dickie's parts.  Beat the lying traitor for this.

Speak of the Dickie, its time to beat him again.

Battle # 47 - Dickie

Body - Oracle
Gun - Afterburner Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Cockroach Pod G
Legs - Standard Legs

Same old, same old.

Go on down to Hillside and fight the girl and the man by the lake.  The man
requires you to have a clean robo, so don't forget.

Battle # 48 - Girl (Hillside)

Body - Luna
Gun - Hornet Gun
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Speed Pod P
Legs - Formula Legs

Battle # 49 - Man (Hillside)

Body - Tricerion
Gun - Rising Gun
Bomb - Freeze Bomb
Pod - Satellite Pod H
Legs - Booster Legs

All right, now its finally time for school.  AFTER you clean the dude's robos.
The extra cash is always good.

Battle # 50 - Boy (Front yard)

Body - Fogey
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Battle # 51 - Girl (Top left Midheart High)

Body - Seal Kid
Gun - Left Spike Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb P
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Standard Legs

Man I hate Seal Kids.

Battle # 52 - Boy (Front of class)

Body - Metal Ape
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Jumping Pod B
Legs - High Jump Legs

Not hard at all.  Metal Ape are too slow.

All right, go sit through class again, and then go to the front gate.  Liv has
already left for Stark, and Dennis leaves you on your own.  Nice.  Jerks.
Anyway head on over to NeoBrain.  Their shop is finally open, and you can buy
bodies.  I recommend the Metal Ape and the Hurricane.  Buy whatever you want.
The legs are decent, but otherwise, there are quite a few decent parts.  Head
on over to the girl for a fight.

Battle # 53 - Girl (NeoBrain)

Body - Swift
Gun - Vertical Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Dolphin Pod
Legs - Ground Legs

Watch for her shots, some of them will clear walls.  She can deal some decent
damage, so be careful.

Now its time to go to Stark on top of Mt. Zephyr.  But if your are a Fellow
or lower, than Stark WON'T accept you.  You need to be Master class or higher
for Stark.  If you aren't, head for a rematch, or try out the arcade in the
Robocenter.  So now head up to the top of the mountain to meet Stark.  Show
Stark the letter and he'll let you into his secret room.  But to learn
Soulboost, you'll need to find and fight Shipley, Winchell, and Kris.  Winchell
is in the Diorama shop in Harbor District.  You'll have to talk to him twice,
but you also have to give away one of your dioramas.  Triassic Trouble, Mummy's
Curse, or Penguin March.  You must also get a combo of 160, while also killing
him.  Man, whiney little boy huh?

Battle # 54 - Winchell

Body - Pipit
Gun - Flame Gun
Bomb - Left Flank Bomb H
Pod - Satellite Pod H
Legs - High Jump Legs

Don't worry, Pipit has very low defense, so combos aren't too hard to get.

Now for Shipley.  Talk to him next to the sea next to NeoBrain.  He'll run off
to the clock tower, so head on over there.  He is directly behind the clock, so
press A and he'll talk.  He'll run off again, this time to park in Hillside.
He wants to fight on a course with insta-death poison in it.  If your
robo touches the poison, your health instantly drops to 0 and you lose.

Battle # 55 - Shipley

Body - Carlyle
Gun - Afterburner Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb P
Pod - Divide Pod
Legs - Feather Legs

As long as you stay near the back of the course, you'll be fine.  There are
conveyor belts that will try to move you to the poison, but if you stay behind
a block, you'll be safe from moving.  Defeat him normally, or try and down him
near the end of the course and hopefully he'll fall in.

Time for Kris.  She's up in the Police HQ training center in Central District.
It is right next to the Police HQ, which is the larger building.  She'll be the
only one in there.  She gives you a test 1st, so here are the answers.

   1) I draw the line at illegal parts
   2) Go outside and find him
   3) Tell him to stop
   4) Nope
   5) I always follow the rules
   6) Rescuing the hostage

Battle # 56 - Kris

Body - Amy
Gun - Meteor Storm Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Cockroach Pod G
Legs - Feather Legs

Beat her within the time limit.  She is strong and fast, which is a very deadly
combination.  You may trouble with this one.

You'll notice a bar show up on the bottom of your screen once you beat all 3
of them.  This shows how much Soulboost power you have.  The bar has to be full
in order for you to use a Soulboost in battle.  After every battle, your bars
will fill up.  Now go back and talk to Stark.  You must face him.

Battle # 57 - Stark

Body - Gramps
Gun - Left Arc Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Throwing Pod D
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Stark will use his Soulboost.  Now you can counter by using Soulboost yourself
or wait.  I recommend using it as soon as Stark's wears off.  That way you get
practice with Soulboost and so you can do maximum damage.  Just remember that
when Soulboost is done, you will be slower and weaker for a couple of seconds.
The bar on top of the screen is the same one that appears on the bottom in
the overworld.  When the bar empties, Soulboost is over.

Alright, go sleep.

========
Day # 9
========

Today's the day of the big Super Nova contest.  So go and get ready to fight.
Go to Central District, clean robos, and then clean yours.  To the left side,
there will be another boy who requires your robo to be clean.  Fight him.

Battle # 58 - Boy (Central)

Body - Pike
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Seeker Pod F
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Easy as cheese.  Just save your Soulboost for the Super Novas later.

Go talk to Liv and Dennis outside of Midheart High.  Head on over to Bayside,
which is in the Harbor District.  But, we'll be meeting an old friend again.
Yup, its Cleaver and another crony.  SAVE BEFORE BATTLING.  He'll be using
ILLEGAL PARTS.  Get ready this fight is serious.  Remember no Robo Cannon.

Battle # 59 - Criminal (Harbor)

Body - Bit
Gun - Wyrm Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Standard Bomb
Pod - Seeker Pod F
Legs - Standard Legs

Go and check the enemies Wyrm Gun.  It is ultra powerful and dangerous.  Be
sure to avoid it at all costs, but try not to use Soulboost if at all possible.
Bit has low defense, so this battle won't be hard to damage him, just running
away from the gun will be.

Now save again.  You'll be facing Cleaver this time.  You won't have enough
mental energy to do so though.  Liv will give you some of hers though.  Crush
that criminal now!

Battle # 60 - Cleaver

Body - Crazy Baboon
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Throwing Pod D
Legs - Standard Legs

What a doofus.  He's a criminal, but he's using all legal parts.  Watch out for
the Crazy Baboon.  It has high defense and raises the power of equipped parts.
Its better than the Metal Ape.  This is a very tough fight, but try to not
use Soulboost.

He still gets away anyway.  Head on over to Bayside and get ready to fight.
They'll let you choose who you want to fight.  You can fight them in any order.

Battle # 61 - Lunax

Body - Apollo
Gun - Flare Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Jumping Pod G
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

Watch out for the magma in the middle.  He is strong, but as long as you fire
first you'll be fine.

Battle # 62 - Terrax

Body - Javelin
Gun - Glider Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Seeker Pod F
Legs - High Jump Legs

This course will turn invisible a few seconds after you are shot out.  It is
only annoying.  Terrax is the weakest of the 3 in my opinion.

Battle # 63 - Solax

Body - Leon
Gun - Mega Burst Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb D
Pod - Twin Flank Pod F
Legs - Plus One Legs

His holosseum fills with water every so often.  He happens to like jumping, and
will be doing that a lot.  As long as you hit him whenever he lands, you can
win easily.  His gun is horrible, as it is very slow.

Go home.

========
Day # 10

Body - Fogey
Gun - Gatling Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

When you walk into school, you'll see Dennis and Liv talking to Kindjal.  She's
a new teacher at your school now.  So, go to class.  When class is over, leave
and some kid will tell you to go to Bull's team room.  Do so.  You'll see Bull
battling a man named Hunter Fraser, who is very strong and knows Soulboost.
Take him to see Liv in your Clubhouse.  Long story short, he wants Liv to help
him in the Robo Cup, Liv says no, Stubbs says police want you.  So head on over
to the HQ for a special surprise.  Kris decides to give you a special license,
that way you can legally fight criminals outside of holosseums.  Stark wants
another battle, so go on to Mt. Zephyr and fight him for the license.

Battle # 71 - Stark

Body - Gramps
Gun - Eagle Gun
Bomb - Volcanic Bomb
Pod - Diving Pod
Legs - High Jump Legs

He is a little tougher than last time.  Remember that he uses Soulboost.  His
Eagle Gun launches shots into the air.  They stay there for a few seconds and
then home onto you.  Watch them.

Otherwise, you got your Special License!  When you go home, eat dinner, and
then go outside for some criminal hunting.  You'll get a call from Duncan.  Go
out and up into the middle of Midheart and you'll find a criminal.  FIGHT HIM!!

Battle # 72 - Criminal (Midheart)

Body - Shadow
Gun - Blade Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Shadow is a Shining Fighter robo like the Ray Mk III is, but he is a horrible
commander.  You'll win without trying.

Go over to the Hillside District, and you'll find another criminal who is
trying to break into a window.  Stop him.

Battle # 73 - Criminal (Hillside)

Body - Crazy Baboon
Gun - Stun Gun
Bomb - Submarine Bomb K
Pod - Ground Freeze Pod
Legs - High Jump Legs

He's strong, but he'll just keep on running into your shots.  Onto the next.

Walk past the Diorama shop in Harbor District, and a criminal will rush out and
steal your License.  He'll give it back, but fight him anyway.  This criminal
uses a holosseum.  Why?

Battle # 74 - Criminal (Harbor)

Body - Glaive
Gun - Gravity Gun
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb G
Pod - Double Wave Pod
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

Punish this sucker for using a holosseum.

This is it for today.  Keep in mind that whenever Duncan says that there won't
be anymore criminal activity, you can head home, or pick up your reward.  Yeah,
lets do that.  Go the Police HQ, and walk to the right side.  There is a little
sliding door that will move when you get close.  Walk through there and talk to
the man behind the small desk for your reward.  WOOOOO Earth Moneys!  Lots of
Earth Moneys!

Time to sleep.

========
Day # 11

Alright, head on up to the Police Training Gym.  A boy will tell you that
Liv and Dennis have already left, so, lets go.  When you get in, Liv will see
her brother.  The famous Eddy, who happens to be very good at battling.  Kris
will give you a new robo, Klimt, a police robo.  A decent robo.  And now you

folks.  As long as you can get used to the Klimt pretty fast, she won't be too
hard.

Head home, and you'll remember that Momma and Pops aren't home from their date
yet.  Start to walk up the stairs, and Liv will come in.  Follow her.  After
the conversation, you'll see Mom and Dad being attacked by criminal commanders.

Walk down to the Diorama store, and you'll see Kris.  Talk to her.  She is on a
lookout for criminals, but wrong store.  Head down to the Diorama store in
the Harbor District, looking into the window like Kris did.  You'll see Coyote
walk up on the side.  Beat his right-hand man, Surly.

Battle # 82 - Surly

Body - Zola
Gun - Right Arc Gun
Bomb - Wave Bomb
Pod - Spider Pod G
Legs - High Jump Legs

Man, this course is insane.  STAY IN THE MIDDLE.  He will usually stay on the
outside of the course, but when he comes in close, down him.  Then shoot him
into the poison.  HA HA.

We're done for tonight.  Go collect your reward, and then sleep.

that is done, go to your Clubhouse, and talk to Liv.  Stubbs will walk in,
wanting you to play hide-and-seek with Kindjal and him.  Polly, Serene's sister
wants to play also.  Head up to the bookshelf, and you'll see Kindjal.

Now that thats all over with, head on back down to class to pick up Liv.  You
will get a call from Dad that says he wants you at NeoBrain.  So lets go.  But
you'll meet Eddy's friend Billy when walking out of school.  Head on over to
NeoBrain and then up to your Dad's lab.  You'll find Dad, Jacobs, and Kindjal
are there.  Tama and Dr. Mars are away.  Jacobs wants you to fight Sling, the
company's sort-of test dummy.  So, lets fight him.  He is pretty strong, so
watch out.

Battle # 97 - Sling (#1)

Body - Robin
Gun - V Laser Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Stabilizer Legs

Sling is a good commander, so watch.

Once you beat him, he'll go into loser mode and demand to fight you again,
this time with an illegal part.  Sore loser. Planning his vengence, that he
will soon unfurl.  Bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum.  Yeah, its supposed to be
a bad allusion to Iron Man.

Battle # 98 - Sling (#2)

Body - Robin
Gun - Rear Front Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Dual Bomb
Pod - Trio Pod H
Legs - Stabilizer Legs

His gun is extremely powerful, so be on the move at all times.  His shots are
two giant pink things in the sky.  His Robin downs very easily, so as long as
you can keep him down, this fight won't be too hard.

Walk to NeoBrain's first floor, and you'll see Dennis.  He and Liv will make
UP, not OUT.  Go on home now, cause its criminal catching time.

Head straight up into the central part of Midheart.  Coyote will be standing
in the middle.  He uses the chef Mr. Masher to fight you.

Battle # 99 - Mr. Masher

He uses a Seal Kid.  Come on, how tough could he be?

Go up to Central District.  Remember where Shipley was?  Coyote is there now.
Walk behind the Clock Tower and fight Coyote.

Battle # 100 - Coyote (Central)

Body - Tempest
Gun - Rear Front Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Wall Bomb
Pod - Charge Pod
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

Save.  This walnut head jumps up and down like a stinking rabbit.  Remember the
technique we used the first time on this course?  Good, do the same.  Stay in
the middle, and wait for him to walk close enough to down him into the poison.
Don't worry if you keep on getting hit by the gun.  He will just approach you
when you are down, so hit him there.  For me, he jumped into the poison himself
so hope for the same.  I recommend using the Metal Ape, or another high defense
robo, that way you can take the shots without getting too much damage.

Walk down to Midheart's park, and he's behind the flowers.  Press A.

Battle # 101 - Coyote (Small Park)

Body - Tempest
Gun - Wyrm Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb B
Pod - Divide Pod
Legs - High Jump Legs

Save before the fight.  Be prepared to use Soulboost.  He is very hard.  Watch
out for his gun.  It is strong and will constantly be hitting you.  Remember,
no remorse.  Just keep on shooting him.  This is a very tough fight.  Combo
the heck out of him.

Okay, no go to Hillside, and press A at the right lower corner of the lake
until Coyote pops out.  Get ready.

Battle # 102 - Coyote (Hillside)

Body - Tempest
Gun - Wyrm Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Winder Bomb
Pod - Beast Pod
Legs - Plus One Legs

Save.  Again, combo the heck out of him, and you should win.

Go to the accountant for some moolah.  Masher gets you $120.00, but Coyote only
gets you $80.00.  Oh well.  They will give you the X-Ray for all of your help.
Cool.  Go sleep.

Pod - Satellite Pod

So now head to the Robocenter and register at the front desk.  Talk to a few
people, and then Mom will show up.  Talk to her, and then the contest will
start.  Talk to Dennis or Liv for it to start.  Stubbs would have been your
first opponent, but his wife takes him out.  Marv runs in to save you from a 
"hollow victory".  Thanks Marv.

Battle # 104 - Marv

firing.  Don't worry, its not too hard.

Battle # 108 - Hunter Fraser

Body - Wolfen
Gun - Shotgun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Ground Freeze Pod
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

Watch, he uses Soulboost.  He is the robo that used Soulboost in the movie that
Tanya gave you.  He really isn't too hard, mainly because he uses Soulboost
very early, so the rest of his performance lacks.  Continually hit him, and you
will win.

Yay, we won.  You also get a cool trophy.  Sweet.  Marv will also give you the
robo Body he uses, Gigantron.  Cool.

ship.  Mom and Tama will board, leaving you free to do what you want.  When
you're done with that, go to the ship.  Winchell, Shipley, and Stark show up.
Winchell and Shipley are going to the Cup also, but not battling.  Listen to
Stark's warning of doom, and then board.  Talk to Liv and Dennis for the ship
to set sail.  After it does, go to the place where you entered (green carpet),

When Liv wakes you, go outside and talk to her.  Go back inside and check on
Dennis in his room (#2).  After the conversation, you'll leave the ship and the
staff member will show you the hotel and NeoBrain.  Go to the hotel.  Liv will
go to her room, and you'll go to yours.  Head left and go up one set of stairs.

Go back into the lobby and check out the shops.  They are full of great parts,

and go to NeoBrain.  She'll go to the training area, while you should head to

should, however, head to the tournament ground.  Look around and then talk to
Liv and Dennis when you want to leave.  Then go to sleep.  But Dennis will wake
you up and say that he saw Liv walk to NeoBrain.  Follow her.  She was

Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Divide Pod 
Legs - Standard Legs

Walk up to 203 and across to 204 to face a roaming G-Robo.  After that head
up and 205

Battle # 149 - G-Robo (9th)

Body - Shadow
Gun - V Laser Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Float Pod F
Legs - Ground Legs

Battle # 150 - Greybaum (7th)

Body - Vanessa
Gun - Right Spike Gun
Bomb - Burrow Bomb D
Pod - Wave Pod
Legs - Feather Legs

Head directly left after room 205 to save a woman.

Battle # 151 - G-Robo (10th)

Body - Hurricane
Gun - Left 5-Way Gun
Bomb - Delta Bomb
Pod - Caboose Pod C
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

She'll give you the President's Key, so you can get into Jacob's office.

Head right after this.  You'll see a man being chased by two robos.  This is
pretty funny stuff man.  Head up near Jacob's office, and you'll see yet
another stinking robo.

Battle # 152 - G-Robo (11th)

Body - Crazy Baboon
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb G
Pod - Diving Pod
Legs - Ground Legs

Head up to Jacob's office and Dennis will come back.  After the conversation
our old buddy Sling will be back for another rematch.  Beat the little snotface
and show him who really is better.  Watch, he uses all illegal parts.

Battle # 153 - Sling

Body - Snipe (Illegal)
Gun - Sling Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Sling Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Sling Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Sling Legs (Illegal)

He isn't hard at all if you beat him to a bloody pulp.  I would have gotten
perfect if there wasn't stupid lava shooting up.  Sling isn't a threat.

Dennis will help Jacobs open the elevator, so head on down to it.  Head through
the previously locked door down the hall until Dennis meets up with you.
You'll see Billy and Eddy fighting robos, but Billy will get hit from behind.
Eddy will run after the robo, so follow him.  You'll have to fight Cleaver.  He
uses all illegal parts.  Save.

Battle # 154 - Cleaver

Body - Violent Boar (Illegal)
Gun - Cleaver Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Cleaver Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Cleaver Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Cleaver Legs (Illegal)

He is much better than Sling, but the same strategy should work.  To get
through his shots, use you dash attack, and then unload you weapons on him.

Billy will come and go into the elevator with you.  You'll find Eddy right
there in B1.  That robo was the one that killed Eddy's father.  You'll split
up.  You'll go right, but there is a Greybaum there to fight.

Battle # 155 - Greybaum (8th)

Body - Pike
Gun - Blade Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Feint Pod F
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Go right and into the side where you'll find a Greybaum training place.  Save.

Battle # 156 - Greybaum (9th lower left)

Body - Vanessa
Gun - Right Spike Gun
Bomb - Burrow Bomb D
Pod - Wave Pod
Legs - Feather Legs

Battle # 157 - Greybaum (10th lower right)

Body - Oracle
Gun - Dragon Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Jumping Pod B
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

There are three robo sellers here.  They are in the top right of the room.  The
left one sells dioramas, while the other two sell the parts from the hotel.
Buy some if you want.  When you're done head back out and go up this time.  Go
up again, and straight to the left.  The room will have a red bar above the
door.  The scientist will tell you to fight the Greybaum to save a hostage.
It is your Pops.

Battle # 158 - Greybaum (11th)

Body - Oracle
Gun - Trap Gun
Bomb - Geo Trap Bomb
Pod - Charge Pod
Legs - Formula Legs

To find the key that unlocks your father's room, you must press A on the
computer in the back of the room.  Head out and go into the first door you see.

Battle # 159 - Greybaum (12th)

Body - Borane
Gun - Sniper Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb S
Pod - Cockroach Pod H
Legs - Feather Legs

Now go down and out of that section.  Head to the left-most room, and a
Greybaum will come at you.

Battle # 160 - Greybaum (13th)

Body - Amy
Gun - Needle Gun
Bomb - Burrow Bomb P
Pod - Umbrella Pod
Legs - Wide Jump Legs

Go into the room he was blocking to find your Dad.  Now once you get out of
the elevator SAVE.  You have to face 4 gatekeepers so that they can unlock the
elevators.  Get ready for these guys.  Head left and follow the path.

REMEMBER:  SAVE AFTER EVERY BATTLE

Battle # 161 - Gatekeeper (DR-Serpent)

Body - Shadow
Gun - Hornet Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb B
Pod - Jumping Pod G
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

This course will annoy you to no end.  The course will constantly be splitting
up and plus, there is magma everywhere.  The Gatekeeper is pretty good also, so
this will be a tough battle.

Go back to the elevator and head straight up.

Battle # 162 - Gatekeeper (DR-Homra)

Body - Oracle
Gun - Dragon Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb P
Pod - Beast Pod
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

This course doesn't split, but there is still magma.  This battle is easier
than the previous one.

Go back to the elevator and follow the path downwards.

Battle # 163 - Gatekeeper (DR-Mayfly)

Body - Vanessa
Gun - Rayfall Gun
Bomb - Straight Bomb S
Pod - Float Pod F
Legs - Ground Legs

This course is modeled after a mountain slope, so it is slanted.  This battle
isn't too hard.

Go back to the elevator and head right for the final gatekeeper.

Battle # 164 - Gatekeeper (DR-Genome)

Body - Zola
Gun - V Laser Gun
Bomb - Standard Bomb F
Pod - Feint Pod G
Legs - Stabilizer Legs

This is on the same shadow course that fought Terrax on.  He isn't too hard.

SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE.  You are about to face the giant tank monster that
you saw in your dreams the first day that you moved to Midheart.  This thing
is a monster.  Be prepared and save.  Leave the Gatekeeper and walk down.

Battle # 165 - Gatekeeper system J (Amun) #1

Body - Jameson (Illegal)
Gun - Amun Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Amun Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Amun Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Amun Legs (Illegal)

This thing has insanely high defense, so consider using the Crazy Baboon, or
something like it.  Try to stay as far away from it as possible.  Long-Range
Guns are a must.  You should use Soulboost to inflict a lot of damage.  Use the
3-Way Gun because it homes better the farther it is shot, and because it shoots
many shots.  This is (in my opinion) one of the hardest battles in the game.
Use the Charge Bomb to deal around 75 damage (if you charge it).

After beating that monster head left to see Dennis face another giant tank.
Yes, we have to face this one again.

Battle # 165 - Gatekeeper system J (Amun) #2

Body - Jameson (Illegal)
Gun - Amun Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Amun Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Amun Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Amun Legs (Illegal)

Good, these are done.  Now save.  Run around your house like 5 times to
celebrate.  Done?  Okay good, lets go.  Remember where you found the key to
unlock your father's room?  Go back that way, and you'll see the Super Novas.
Go past them, and into the hall to the right.  The wall will split, revealing
an elevator.  Go into it.  Save again, you'll be facing Kindjal right now.

Battle # 166 - Kindjal

Body - Freya (Illegal)
Gun - Kindjal Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Kindjal Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Kindjal Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Kindjal Legs (Illegal)

Follow the same tactics as you did with the tanks.  You don't have to use the
Crazy Baboon, though.  Her defense isn't through the roof.  Stay away from her
and attack from a distance.  She'll often go onto the ice, which will make her
reaction time slow and she will slide.  Launch you bomb and pods at her when
she is like this.  When she comes close, shoot your gun.  When she shoots at
you, use you dash attack to escape it.

Save and then walk.  You'll find the robo that killed Eddy's father, Katana,
sitting there.  Eddy will fight it, but its a fake.  The real one attacks him,
so you must defeat him.

Battle # 167 - Katana

Body - Scythe (Illegal)
Gun - Scythe Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Scythe Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Scythe Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Scythe Legs (Illegal)

This course has giant swords that pop up in it.  They will damage and down you.
Katana isn't too hard.  He is fast, but he vanishes way too much.  Show him
the error of his ways and kill him for Eddy and Liv.

Go into the next room.  Don't worry, this is hard.

Battle # 168 - Hadron

Body - Hadron (Illegal)
Gun - Hadron Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Hadron Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Hadron Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Hadron Legs (Illegal)

You must consistently hit this guy.  He is extremely hard, as he is fast,
strong, and has low down time.  There isn't much I can help you with, so I will
just give you my Robo.

Body - Tempest
Gun - 3-Way Gun
Bomb - Charge Bomb
Pod - Satellite Pod
Legs - Booster Legs

Leave the Satellite Pods everywhere.  When Hadron comes near you, shoot your
gun or bomb, and then dash attack him.  Run, lay down the Satellite Pods, and
repeat.

After you beat him, he will absorb all of Scythe's energy and knowledge.
Hadron can now speak, and is ultra powerful.  YOU CANNOT WIN THIS BATTLE.  I
mean it.

Battle # 169 - Hadron

Body - Hadron (Illegal)
Gun - Hadron Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Hadron Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Hadron Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Hadron Legs (Illegal)

Liv will take all of your friends' energy and give it to you.  Aww, how nice.
Save before the battle, and get ready to face the hardest battle.

Battle # 170 - Hadron

Body - Hadron (Illegal)
Gun - Hadron Gun (Illegal)
Bomb - Hadron Bomb (Illegal)
Pod - Hadron Pod (Illegal)
Legs - Hadron Legs (Illegal)

You will stay in Soulboost from the instant that both of you are up until the
end.  This is almost like battle # 168, just as both of you in Soulboost.
Follow the same strategy.  If you stay close to him and continually hit him,
you should be able to win.  Oh, and if you play the song "Free Bird" by Lynyrd
Skynyrd, you should be able to win.  It worked for me.

WOOOOHOOOOO!!!!  You beat Hadron.  Now read what happened after the battle, as 
told by Dennis, and then sit through the credits.  But you aren't done yet.

========
Day # 17
========

Save as soon as possible.  Then head outside.  When you're at school, Angelica
will be there to talk to you.  She'll take you, Liv, Dennis, and the Super
Novas on to the ship.  Head on down to the green carpet and Angelica will come
out.  After her speech, talk to Liv and get some sleep.

=========
Day # 18
=========

Ahhh, your final day.  Go out onto the ship's deck.  After all that stuff is
over, go to the tournament grounds.  Stand in line between Liv and Dennis.
The rules will be the same as last time, just with much fewer fighters.

Once you are in the forest, take that path below you and follow it.  You'll
talk to Lunax across the river.  Liv will tell you to head east, so do it.
You'll see Solax and Terrax, so lets battle them.

Battle # 171 - Solax

Body - Leon
Gun - Mega Burst Gun
Bomb - Right Wave Bomb
Pod - Sky Freeze Pod
Legs - Short Thrust Legs

No problem at all.

Battle # 172 - Terrax

Body - Javelin
Gun - Glider Gun
Bomb - Wall Bomb
Pod - Beast Pod
Legs - Plus One Legs

Same old course, same old Terrax.

Alright, so head up now.  Go into the clearing and you'll see Marv again.  Lets
fight the little loser.

Battle # 173 - Marv

Body - Gigantron
Gun - Gravity Gun
Bomb - Right Flank Bomb H
Pod - Twin Flank Pod G
Legs - High Jump Legs

This walnut-face is fighting on that stupid splitting course with the magma.
Show him the error of his ways and win.

Head out of this screen, and down and out of the next.  You'll be out on the
side of a river now.  Head east and into the big clearing in the next screen.
Go down, and talk to Serene.  Now you can battle her.

Battle # 174 - Serene

Body - Miranda
Gun - Scorpion Gun
Bomb - Direct Bomb
Pod - Satellite Pod H
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

Don't forget that she knows Soulboost.  That will be your only problem in this
fight.

Now that is three wins (Marv doesn't count).  Head out of this screen.  In the
next, go to the right and down across the bridge.  Save.  Go fight Hunter.

Battle # 175 - Hunter

Body - Wolfen
Gun - Magnum Gun
Bomb - Crescent Bomb C
Pod - Seeker Pod F
Legs - Quick Jump Legs

Don't forget that Hunter also knows Soulboost.  This course is very small, so
you may have difficult with it.  Use a good dogfighter, like Amy or Comet.
Stay away from his Magnum Gun, because it will knock you down in one hit.  When
he is in Soulboost, try to stay away from him because he will deal massive
damage.  Good luck.

Okay, go down and out of this screen.  In the next, head to the bottom left and
leave.  In the next, you can help Angelica squish bugs, but you don't have to.
Now go straight up in the next screen.  Once through that one, head left and
exit the new screen.  Keep walking left in the next screen, and you'll find
Dennis.  He is the 5th battle.  Sorry buddy.

Battle # 176 - Dennis

Body - Mantis
Gun - Hornet Gun
Bomb - Tomahawk Bomb G
Pod - Dolphin Pod G
Legs - Long Thrust Legs

Wow, he really has come a long way.  But, we need to win more than he does.
He is good at combos though.

Follow Dennis out of this forest.  You don't have to battle Billy, but you can
if you want.

Battle # 177 - Billy

Body - Anne
Gun - Dragon Gun
Bomb - Delta Bomb
Pod - Spider Pod G
Legs - High Jump Legs

She isn't too tough.

Head out of the forest. You'll be taken to another place to decide the Robo
Cup winner.  Your first opponent is Lunax.

Battle # 178 - Lunax

Body - Apollo
Gun - Flare Gun
Bomb - Gemini Bomb P
Pod - Wave Pod
Legs - Booster Legs

Lunax now knows Soulboost, and he'll use it almost as soon as he opens up.

Save if you want, you're going to face Eddy.

Battle # 179 - Eddy

Body - Mistral
Gun - Sagittarius Gun
Bomb - Volcanic Bomb
Pod - Jumping Pod G
Legs - Booster Legs

Eddy isn't too hard.  He knows Soulboost though, so watch for that.

But otherwise, you WIN!  You'll get the Robo Cup for winning!  Congratulations!
You beat the game!  But you still aren't done!

10.) FAQ
----------------------------------------

So after 10 months since this "FAQ" has been published online, there has been
no "FAQ" in this "FAQ".  Wait no longer my friends, here it is.  Well, not
here, it is down a couple of lines, but you know what I mean.  Or do you?

Note:  This will be edited somewhat (for ease of reading and understanding)
Note 2: I DO NOT want hateful and vulgar emails.  I am not your slave.  In fact
        you are probably mine.  Go get me some tacos!  :P

From Dan
Q: My son is playing the Custom Robo Arena game and is stuck on a certain
   section.  We went to your website to look for answers and still cannot seem
   to find what we need.  I hope it is okay for us to E-Mail you directly
   because he is really frustrated and needs some direction.

   Specifically, he is stuck on Day 10 because he cannot find Team Numero Uno's
   Clubhouse.  Can you give us an idea of what to do at this point or where to
   look on the internet for an answer?

   Sincerly,

   Dan

A: The Clubhouse is in MidHeart High.  When you walk into the school, go
   immediately to your right.  The clubhouse (Team Numero Uno's) is the only
   building in that screen.

   To get to Bull's clubhouse, you must walk into the main central part of
   school.  Head left from there and go into the first door you see.

From Bobby
Q: Hey dude, I read your walkthrough in GameFAQs.  It was very helpful but, I
   didn't understand you in one part.  Can you please tell me again how I can
   get to the underground?

A: First you need to be in the grudge match section of the game.  You need to
   get the Dark Commander's Mark from the hologram of you.  He is located
   outside of your clubhouse after about 10-13 completed grudge battles.  When
   you beat him, he will give you the Mark.  Then go to the lower left house in
   Harbor District.  Talk to the man inside, and underneath his bed, will be a
   ladder opening to the underground.

From R FISH
Q: What is your most recommended customization with no illegal parts?

A: Well, I would recommend trying to find parts that best fit your playing
   style.  Not everyone is going to be amazing with the same set up.

   Personally, I like:

   Metal Ape
   3-Way Gun
   Charge Bomb
   Satellite Pods
   Quick Jump Legs

From Paul
Q: Hello,

   My name is Paul and I love Custom Robo Arena.  I am battling Coyote in the
   pond area in Hillside.  I couldn't beat him so I went to sleep.  Will he
   still be there?  What would you recommend fighting him with because I bought
   the Robin especially for him.  What guns should I get at the harbor parts
   store?

A: If you went to sleep, he is gone for now, and that probably wasn't the best
   decision.  I recommend using a Metal Ape, as it increases the power.  For
   strong guns, I use the Magnum Gun, but my favorite is the 3-Way Gun.

From Henry
Q: Is it OK if I download your FAQ?  If so, can you please send it as an
   attachment (if possible)?

A: Download for what?  Personal use?  If so, then you can just copy it straight
   from GameFAQs and paste it into notepad.  If not, then no.

From Jesper aka jespoOo
Q: Hey James (I can say James right??)
   
   I got a suggestion for your FAQ on Custom Robo Arena.  When you have to beat'
   Winchell for Stark's test you have to give him a diorama right?  He wants
   Triassic Trouble, Dolphin March, or Mummy's Curse.  when you give him
   Dolphin March you don't have to fight him.  You'll pass his test and (here
   comes the best part) 10,000 cash/credit whatever.
   
   I hope you can use this info. (Put credit on behalf of jespoOo)

A: Really?  That's pretty cool.  I will add it, it'll probably take me a while
   though.

Q: One thing... you're the first FAQ writer who actually sent me a reaction to
   one of my e-mails......:P

A: Really, that's pretty funny.  I have work and stuff, and I'm pretty lazy,
   but I'll add it within the next ten years or so.

Q: That's a lot faster than usual....:P

From Jon
Q: To blcklblskt,

   I used your walkthrough for Custom Robo Arena and it rocked.  I just have
   one question.  After you complete all of the mission battles, all of the
   grudge battles, and all of the underground battles, and then beat Eddy and
   Liv, what do you do then?  Do you go to Liv's house for the party?  Do you
   get accepted into the IPC?  I'm kinda confused because I thought that you'd
   be accepted into the IPC like Kris said.  If you could answer this, that
   would be great.

   From,

   Jon

A: I haven't played in forever.  But I believe that you still don't get into
   the IPC.  You just get the license.  Did you beat it yet?  I'm pretty sure
   that the game is pretty much over after you beat Liv.
