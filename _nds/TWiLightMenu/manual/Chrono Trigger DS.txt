              ~Introduction~
==========================================
Welcome readers! I'm Deathborn 668 on the message boards and this is
a walkthrough for Chrono Trigger, the port of the SNES classic of the same
name, with a true English translation, for the Nintendo DS. Hopefully 
you'll enjoy this walthrough as much as I enjoyed playing this game. Some 
Do's and Don'ts to keep in mind:
DO:
-Use this walkthrough as a refrence tool
-Tell people about it
-Print it for personal use
-Give to other people for no profit

DON'T:
-Plagerize this walkthrough without any credit
-Call this walkthrough "yours"
-Sell this walkthrough for profit

ONLY the following sites have permission to use this walkthrough without
the need to contact me:

Anybody else wishing to use this walkthrough will need to e-mail me at
someguy668 (at) yahoo (dot) com
Those wishing to leave me comments and corrections should also e-mail me.
I generally won't respond to e-mails, and probably won't update if you send
me a correction unless it extremely important. Don't feel offended if I 
don't respond or update with a change.
Thanks for your concern.

**And remember, use Ctrl+F to search for what you need.** I definitely do
not respond to e-mails asking about something you can more than easily find
with Ctrl+F. Also, DO NOT ask me about "What level should my characters be
at point X". I will not respond to these either. If you are getting 
destroyed by enemies, obviously you're underleveled. If bosses are way too
easy, you're overleveled. It's an RPG. You can, literally, beat the game at
any level with the right equipment. If you can't beat something, just level
up. Or buy better equipment.

=============================================

===========================================================================
                           ~1.Basic Storyline~
===========================================================================
It's the year 1000 AD, and it happens to be the day of the Millenial Fair,
celebrating one thousand years of prosperity in the kingdom. Crono wakes up
in his house near the fair, and meets the young girl Marle while on his way
to see his friend Lucca. After Marle tags along with Crono, the pair head
off to see Lucca's newest invention, a short range teleportation machine.

Eager to try it out, Marle steps in. However, instead of being teleported
to the pod nearby, a reaction with a pendant she is wearing occurs, and she
disappears into a blue portal. Crono rushes off to save her, and ends up
getting thrown into a trip through time.

Little do they know that they are the only ones who can travel through the
time streams, and overall prevent an apocalyptic future from occurring.

===========================================================================
                               ~2.Controls~
===========================================================================
Note that these are simple the default controls. In the Options tab you 
can switch around what the A, B, Y, and X buttons do. All of the other
buttons on the DS cannot be changed. 

A Button-Confirm decisions, scroll through text boxes, examine objects

B Button-Cancel decisions, hold to run/walk (dependant on settings)

X Button-Bring up main menu

Y Button-Makes Time Compass appear (only while onboard the Epoch)

Start-Dimly lights the screen and pauses the game

Select-Make a blurry view of the era you're in appear (only while roaming
the World Map)

L/R Buttons-Hold both in combat to escape from battle (doesn't work in some
fights, and has a bit of a delay to it)

Control Pad-Move characters, move cursor in menus and text decisions

===========================================================================
                               ~3.Main Menu~
===========================================================================
Press the X Button at any point in the game, other than when in dialogue 
or in battles, to bring up the Main Menu. Here there are seven options on
the touch screen, while the current status of all of your party members
(current HP and MP) are displayed on the top screen. You will often be 
using the Main Menu for various things, so get used to the seven options 
you choose while it is open.

--------------
~3A.Equipment~
--------------
Familiar to anyone who has ever played an RPG, the Equipment tab is where
you will, naturally, equip all of your party characters with weapons and
armor to boost their stats and aid in combat. You will find a ton of 
equipment through the game, both purchasable and findable through chests in
dungeons, and rewards for sidequests. That last way of finding weapons/
armor, generally, results in much better armor than the ones purchasable.

Press the L or R buttons to shift between everyone's current equipment.
Also, the top screen notes what level the character is at, current amount
of Experience, and the Experience needed to reach the next level. Check
this info whenever curious how much Exp is needed to level up. As with all
RPG's, leveling up boosts your stats, providing a better chance at 
surviving in battle.

You can equip only four pieces of equipment--weapon, helm, armor, and 
accessory. Choose the piece of equipment and you can swap it for another
type in your inventory. The top screen will show what stats are effected if
you switch equipment with whatever the cursor is pointing to. Numbers in
blue represent an increase in a stat while red represents a decrease. 
Sometimes you may need to sacrifice a stat or two for increases in other
stats. Also note that some helms and armor are limited to certain
characters (for instance, a few pieces of armor can only be worn by the
females).

Weapon--Every party member uses a unique type of weapon. One uses swords,
another katanas, and another uses crossbows. Characters can ONLY use their
own catagory of weapons. For instance, Crono can wield any katana, but he
cannot wield crossbows (Marle's weapon). 

Helm--Classified as generally helmets, these items primarily boost 
Defense and Magic Defense. Higher tiered helms can also boost additional
stats, as well as grant useful battle bonuses such as immunity to all
status effects, halved ATB gauge fill time, and more.

Armor--Identical to helms; these also boost Defense and Magic Defense.
Again, additional stats can be boosted such as Strength and Speed. Also
like helms, top tier armors feature additional bonuses, still including
immunity to status changes, among other abilities.

Accessory--You will easily find a ton of accessories in chests throughout
the game. Every character is capable of wearing any accessory, and the 
effects are generally immidiate in battle. Some boost Strength, Speed,
give status immunity, increase attack power, and so on. Several sidequests
give out some of the most useful accessories as rewards, so try to do these
sidequests at some point in the game when you are strong enough to take
them on.

--------------
~3B.Inventory~
--------------
In this tab you can view every single item you currently possess. You can
use L and R to shift through the various catagories of items, them being
Consumables, Weapons, Helms, Armor, Accessories, and Key Items. Consumables
in yellow text (which only happens when you're not in battle) can be used
to heal your team, or boost their stats in the case of Capsule items.

----------
~3C.Techs~
----------
Use this tab to view the learned Techs of each character. If a Tech is
greyed out, the character is trying to learn it and requires more TP (the
required amount left to learn that Tech will be to the right of that name).

Double and Triple Techs that each character is part of will also be listed.
Techs with a star next to the name are magic attacks (these are described
by players as "story related magic techs" as, for instance, Lucca's 
Flamethrower attack is a magic attack, but doesn't have the star next to it
and she knows it right away).

You'll learn magic-related Techs from Spekkio in the End of Time. Complete
his annoying little test and he'll teach everyone in your current party,
at least those compatible, their basic magic Tech. Swap in members who need
their magic techs and talk to him again and he'll teach it to them.

-------------
~3D.Bestiary~
-------------
Exactly as it says:A list of every enemy you've encountered in the game.
And by encountered, I mean you just need to have fought it in battle. If 
the foe runs away, or you run away, it'll still be logged into the 
Bestiary.

The Bestiary gives info on the foe's HP, Defense and Magic Defense, items
they may drop after being killed, the item stolen from them if they are hit
by Ayla's Charm attack, as well as info on the Techs they use, the magic
type attacks they are weak/immune/absorb and replenish their own HP, and
finally the locations of where you can fight the foe.

-------------
~3E.Settings~
-------------
This tab allows you to tinker with all of the settings in the game. There
are four pages of settings.

Page 1:
Game Mode--If you choose Classic, the battle system will function exactly
like it did in the SNES version. If you choose DS, the Attack/Tech/Item
buttons appear on the touch screen, allowing for a much easier method to 
choose options for all characters. Their HP and MP values are also shown on
the touch screen, and so is the Attack Bar.

Battle Mode--Just like in the SNES version, you still have this option. If
set to Active, enemies can attack you as you are making menu decisions in
battle. If set to Wait, enemies will not attack you if you are choosing a
Tech, Item, or selecting which enemy to attack. If on this mode, enemies
can sometimes attack you while making decisions, generally because they 
were already in the processing of walking up to attack you just before you
choose the Attack/Tech/Item command.

Battle Speed--Set how fast the ATB gauges fill, as well as how quickly
enemies will attack. At a slow setting the ATB will take an agoninzingly
long time to fill up, but enemies will also take a long time to attack in
comparison. If set on a fast setting, the bars fill up absurdly fast, but
enemies will also attack quickly if you hesitate. Mess with this option a
bit and find what best suits you.

Battle Message Speed--Set how fast the messages in battle appear. At a fast
setting they will appear and disappear quickly, allowing for quick battles.
At a slow setting they will stay on the screen for a longer period of time,
allowing slower readers the chance to read what they have to say.

Page 2:
Battle Cursor Memory--Makes the cursor remember it's last position. If set
to Off, you'll always have to scroll back to your previous decision if you
want to repeat it. If set to Commands, it will remember if you last placed
it on Attack, Tech, or Item. If set to Action, the cursor will remain at
the last item or Tech you choose for each character. If set to Full, you
get both Commands and Action.

Status Bars--If On, it places an HP and ATB bar right below the characters
(on DS mode, the HP value and another ATB remains on the touch screen). If
Off, obviously these won't appear. You cannot turn this feature Off in
Classic mode.

Battle Gauges--Pick what you want the Battle Gauge to look like. Type A is
identical to the SNES version. Type B lets the HP and MP amounts get 
covered by the Attack/Tech/Item commands. Type C is like Type A, only it
also lists the maximum HP value of each character. This setting cannot be
used in DS Mode.

Help Messages--Choose whether or not you want the descriptions of Techs,
as well as enemy names (on the top screen) to appear in battle. This option
is stuck as On in DS Mode.

Page 3:
Control Scheme--Switch what the A, B, X, and Y buttons do. Leave them alone
for the nostalgia effect (not to mention they work just fine as default),
or switch them to fit your playstyle.

Movement--How your characters move by default. If on Walk, your characters
will always walk and will run if you hold the B button. If on Run, your
characters will always run and will walk if you hold the B button. 

Shortcut Assignments--The buttons on the side of the touch screen are
shortcuts to the various main menu tabs. With this option you can rearrange
the order of the shortcuts, or put them in a row at the bottom of the
screen if you wish.

Menu Cursor Memory--Choose if you want the cursor in the Main Menu to 
remain in the same spot when you open it again as when you last closed if.
If On, this'll be enabled. If Off, it won't.

Page 4:
Movies--Choose if movies that occur during several plot points in the game
will play. If On, they will. If Off, they won't.

Window Design--Choose the style of the text and display windows. There are
eight different designs and colors, so pick the one you like the best.

----------
~3F.Party~
----------
In this tab you can switch the members of your party. For the majority of
the game Crono will be forced as the leader of your party (the top slot),
leaving only two open slots for party members. Eventually you will be able
to have any three characters be in a party, as Crono won't be required past
said plotpoint.

As a sidenote, characters not in your current party will only gain 75% of
Exp earned in battles, and won't gain TP. Also, for unused party members,
when they level up remaining experience is thrown out. For example, if they
require 200 Exp to level up and you get 400 from a fight, 75% of 400 is 
300, and 300-200 is 100, so 100 Exp would not apply to the unused 
character.

---------
~3G.Save~
---------
Obviously, save the game. You can only save the game when exploring the
World Map, or when you are standing in a small circle of green sparkles
(only found inside dungeons, usually at the very end). It's best to save
often, as I'm sure you already know.

===========================================================================
                             ~4.Battle System~
===========================================================================
The battle system can be a bit complex at first, but it's actually rather
simple to understand. First, make sure your characters have the best
equipment they can possibly have, and an accessory that tries to aid their
weaknesses.

Once in combat itself, you'll notice everybody has an Attack Bar, or ATB.
The blue bar fills up depending on your characters' Speed stat. The higher
that stat, the faster the bar fills. Speed caps at 16, which pretty much 
means at that point you will never need to wait to make an attack.

Once the ATB is full for a character, they can make an action. Your three
options are to Attack with your equipped weapon. No, no timed hits in this
game. All weapons have a chance to score a critical hit, doubling damage
done. Critical Hit percentage is dependant on the weapon equipped, any 
Critical % boosting items, and other bonuses armor and helms give. I 
believe the lowest, and base crit %, is 10%. However it isn't exactly 
known.

The second option you have is to use a Tech. These more powerful attacks 
use of MP, but can attack single or multiple enemies. Some Techs can heal
allies, of revive them if they're fainted. Every Tech uses of MP, and you 
need to have at least the MP cost in order to use the Tech. Luckily, MP
restoring items are cheap and easy to come by, and they can also be
replenished by staying at an inn. Also, most characters have Double and
Triple Techs. These Techs are used by two and three characters 
respectively. In order for the Tech to even appear on the list in battle,
both or all characters in the Tech must be present in the current party.
Also, both or all their ATB's must be full. 

Finally, there's the Items option. Obviously, you can use a consumable from
your current inventory to help or heal you in combat. 

You can also hold L and R, or tap the button in the lower left corner of 
the touch screen to escape from battle. You'll need to wait a bit before 
you can escape, and you can't escape from all battles.

Finally, enemies can inflict status effects on your party. Here's the list
of these effects:
Confused--Signified by a star above the character's head. You cannot 
control the next 2-4 actions they can make when the ATB fills. Instead they
will randomly attack someone on screen, whether it be foe or ally. Their
liklihood of hitting also decreses a bit.

Poisoned--Signified by small bubbles above the character's head, you will
take a small amount of damage every few seconds. The length of time between
times you take damage depends on the battle speed option.

Stop--Signified by a clock over the inflicted's head, Stop prevents the ATB
from filling. Until this status effects goes away or is cured, the 
character cannot make any actions since the ATB isn't filling.

Blindness--An eyeball with an X over it appears above the character. This
status effect heavily decreases accuracy, making it very likely you'll miss
the foe when attacking.

Locked--Marked by a question mark above your head, characters that have 
been Locked cannot use the Tech or Item commands.

Sleep--Signified by Z's above their head (and the fact they actually fall
asleep on the ground), Sleep is just like being Stopped. Can't perform
any actions until woken up, and the ATB will not fill.

===========================================================================
                          ~5.Guide Through Time~
===========================================================================
And now for the meat of the guide itself--the walkthrough. As I do with the
majority of my walkthrough, this is split into sections. View the table of
contents and Ctrl+F your way to the section you are stuck on. Unlike my
other walkthroughs, I did not just make up the titles. These are the exact
titles that appear on the save screen during various points of the game.

Simply put, if you want to know where in the guide you're stuck, just save
the game and head to that section of the walkthrough. Most sections are
moderately short, so it shouldn't take terribly long to find your position.

If you can't save and don't remember the title of the section of game you
are stuck in, you're likely in a dungeon. You will visit almost every
dungeon in the game only one time. Thusly, if stuck in a dungeon, just 
Ctrl+F the name of it (the name of the dungeon is shown on the Main Menu).

I capitalize the names of items you find in chests, as well as key items
you may obtain in your journey. This should make it slightly easier to keep
track of your location in dungeons. Also, I refer to the playable 
characters by their default names. 

Finally, this is not a 100% walkthrough because it is impossible to 100% 
the game in a single playthrough (and even so, it's practically impossible
to 100% the game period. I've spent 40 hours trying to obtain a group of 5
items that lady luck isn't handing over. Don't fret, completionists like 
me--there's still a lot else you can 100%). All sidequests are listed in a
seperate section. They should be completed on your first playthrough, but
that's your option.

And remember to save often. You never know what might happen!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~5A.The Millennial Fair~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose to start a New Game from the title screen menu. You'll then be
prompted to change a few settings before starting the game. You need to
choose to be in DS or Classic mode (I prefer DS mode--it's much easier to
play with), Active or Wait battle style (Choose Active if you want a more
challenging battle style, forcing you to hurry your decisions. Wait is
advised for most players as it lets you take your time), and whether or not
ingame cinematics play (they're the same as the PSX port. Once you're done,
press Start to begin the game. You can always change these settings later
in the game. You'll get to name Crono before anything starts. I'm referring
to everyone by their default names, but change them if you feel like it.

========================
~Crono's House; 1000 AD~
========================
Typical for the male RPG protaganist to oversleep some big event. After the
rest of the cutscene plays out, Crono will get out of bed. Follow your
kitty downstairs. Once down there, your mother will ask the name of your
female inventor friend. She's Lucca, and again you can change it to 
whatever pleases you.

Telling you to head to the fair, you're free to leave. Talk to mom one more
time to receive 200G in starting funds. It won't buy much, but it's 
something. Now take the exit in the bottom right corner.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Press the X Button to open the Main Menu. Set any configurations that you
wish, change text box colors, and remember that any time on the World Map
you're capable of saving the game. Get used to the layout of this menu as
you will be returning to it quite often.

Now, you can head a few steps north to Leene Square, or if you're a 
newcomer to the game you can enter the southmost green house which is the
Mayor's Manor. It's a small tutorial area. It also has a few free items.

========================
~Mayor's House; 1000 AD~
========================
Everyone in the first floor will give you additional tips on playing the
game, the majority of which are also in the instruction manual. The chest
to the left of the green haired kid contains a POTION. Head upstairs and
repeat the process. Talk to the old man with glasses and agree to listen
to him. Talk to him a second time to receive 300G. Finally, open the chest
behind that man and grab an extra 100G.

Head back to the World Map and to Leene Square to the north.

=======================
~Leene Square; 1000 AD~
=======================
Welcome to the Millennial Fair itself. There's a lot to do here. Talk to
people here if you want to learn about the fair. The three tents here have
some nice stuff. The two on the left are shops--the bottom one sells basic
healing items (I advise buying about 3 or 4 Potions for the road). The top
one sells a Bronze Helm for a cheap 200G. Buy two of them and equip one
on Crono.

The right tent houses the four people running around the fairgrounds. When
all four are lined up near the man, talk to him to guess who will win. The
old man standing a little southeast of the tent will exclaim the winner 
most likely to win the next race. Place a bet correctly and talk to the
man when that runner wins to earn 20 Silver Points. Finally, talk to 
Melchior, the man standing just left of this tent. He sells two powerful
swords. Buy and equip the Bronze Blade (it's a cheap 350G). The powerful
Silver Sword is far too expensive for you, unless you want to grind in this
area for cash in a minute.

Head north into the upper half of the fair. Walk into the girl running
about. After you both get up off the ground, talk to her about her lost
pendant, then head right and grab it. Talk to the girl again to hand it 
back to her. Agree to let her follow you around for a little while. You can
now name Marle whatever you wish, but as usual I'll stick with the default.

**Optional Things:
The next few things are totally optional, but are good for experience and
can get you free items in an event a little later in the game. Head left,
ignore the pink bag on the table at all costs, and head north and to the
next screen. Here is Gato, Lucca's homemade training robot. You'll earn
15 Silver Points if you can beat this simple foe, as well as a little TP
and some Exp. I advise fighting him a few times so Crono and Marle are 
level 2 or 3. To fight him again just leave the screen and come back to
him. He'll counterattack every attack unless he's standing near the top of
the screen. Keep it in mind if you don't want to have to use a Potion every
few attacks.

If you want you can fight him a ton of times, then go back to the previous
screen and talk to the man at the far left tent to trade 10 Silver Points
for 50G. You can do this a bunch of times to afford that Silver Sword for
Crono, but you can get one for free a bit later if you don't want to grind
for cash.

Just to the left of the entrance to Gato's screen you can find a kitty. 
Talk to it and it will follow you. Lead it to the far right side of the
screen. It can get stuck behind objects easily if you go too fast. Don't
talk to the cat again or it will run off (if you leave the screen and come
back it'll respawn). Once you reach the right side of this area with the
kitty, talk to the young girl who will be happy you brought her her kitty.

The man here hosts a drinking contest. Just mash the A button as many times
as possible to drink cans of soda. If you manage to drink eight, you can
earn 5 Silver Points. Not really worth the effort. Now head south and to
the lower area of the fair. Talk to Melchior near the fountain, see his
wares or not, and then he'll ask if you want to sell Marle's pendant. 
Choose not to. 
**End Optional Things

In the lower half of the fairgrounds, talk to the merchant in the top left
tent (if you did the optional things, it's just left of Melchior). 
Regardless if you wanted to buy goods or not, exit out of the purchase
menus and the merchant will inform you Lucca's device is all set up. Head
north, through the upper area of the fair, and attempt to go to the next
screen. Marle will decide to want some candy before leaving, so wait
patiently for her to finish. Do not move whatsoever. Once she's done, head
north to the next screen.

A bunch of people are gathered here. Wait for Lucca to finish describing
her invention, then talk to her. Hop up onto the left telepod and you'll
be transported to the right one. After this, talk to Marle and she'll want
to try as well. 

**Note--You may have noticed a part of the right telepod briefly sparkle
when you entered the screen. These sparkly circles are all across the game,
usually being hidden stat boosting items. This one, however, is not one of
them. If you're curious what trying to grab this circle does, go back to 
the World Map and save. I won't spoil it...it's pretty funny if you're new
to the game. You can only do this before you use the left telepod. After
doing that the right telepod event will be inactive until you can access
Leene Square again.

Marle will attempt teleportation, however her pendant causes an unnatural
reaction and she ends up getting sucked into a blue vortex. Pick up the
pendant she left behind and Lucca will suck you into the odd blue vortex
as well.

====================
~Truce Canyon; ? AD~
====================
Try to leave to the left upon entering this area and you'll be ambushed by
three Blue Imps. They're quite weak, and a simple Attack will kill each of
them off. Head left, up the ladder above you, and across the bridge to a
forced fight. There's a ton of forced fights in the game that you,
obviously, cannot avoid. I suppose they're there to ensure you keep
leveling up so you're never underleveled.

After the fight, head left and open the chest to get a POTION. Then head
south, go right for a chest with a POWER GLOVE, and then south some more.
Fight the Imps here if you wish, then keep heading south and leave the
area.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~5B.The Queen Returns~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
~World Map; ? AD~
=================
Head south a bit to the small town of Truce. Enter the buildings and talk
to the people to find out you're in 600 AD. Head into the Truce Inn and 
pay 10G to fully heal yourself. Head left into the Market and purchase a
Bronze Vest if you have the funds. You could use the extra Defense, but if
you lack funds that's fine. It'll still be here later.

Back out on the map, head left. After a second or two, head north and enter
Guardia Forest. It's right below the castle. Not terribly difficult to
miss.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
Head north, then right at the split. Beat off the Roundillo and Green Imp 
in a forced fight, then head south. At the bottom of the clearing you will
find a sparkling object right below the southern rock. Pick it up to 
trigger a fight against more Imps and Roundillos. The upper stone also has
a sparkling object just to the left of it, holding a STRENGTH CAPSULE. 
These capsules permanently raise your Strength by one. One point of
Strength adds one point to Attack. Use it on Crono or save it for later.

Head back north. In the upper clearing here you'll get into another forced
fight (remember to heal with Potions if things get dicey). Head left and
you'll notice a bush rattle as you walk past it. Examine it and an enemy 
will get out an run away, dropping a Shelter (these items fully heal your
party's HP and MP at a save point, or in the World Map). 

Head left, then at the split go south if you want more Exp. Otherwise, head
north. The clearing here is another fight against Roundillo Riders. Head
north after the fight, and at the split head north again to exit the 
forest.

You're on the World Map, but only briefly. Head north a few steps and into
Guardia Castle.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
You won't get very far into the castle before some guards stop you. Luckily
the Queen Leene comes over to save you. Once she leaves you will have 
relatively free access to the castle. Head left through the hallway and to
the bottom floor. Talk to the maid in yellow to rest and restore your 
health. After this, return to the entrance and follow the right hallway,
and down the stairs again to end up in the kitchen. The chest in here
contains an ETHER, an MP restoring item.

Return to the entrance, and finally go north and into the King's chamber.
Talk to the King to find out he's curious why Leene is acting strange, and
then talk to the Chancellor to make him leave. Head up the hallway on the
left and head up the stairs. On the third floor you can find a chest with 
100G inside. Head to the top floor and run to the King's bedroom. Next to
his bed is a chest with a BRONZE ARMOR inside. Equip it right away on 
Crono.

Head back to the King and follow the hallway to the right this time. Head
up the stairs, get the POTION in a chest on the third floor, then continue
to the top floor. Talk to the soldier blocking the doorway to make him 
move, then run into the Queen's chambers. Talk to her and during the small
scene you'll find out, if you didn't already deduce it, that she's Marle.

...and just before your little reunion gets good she gets killed. Or 
disappears into blue sparkles. Yeah. Probably wanna skedaddle before anyone
finds out. Get the chest near where she was standing for an ETHER. Head 
back downstairs and you'll meet up with Lucca. Somehow. She'll explain that
you're causing a ton of time paradoxes right now, eventually leading into
Marle never existing. 

Looks like we have to save two ladies now. Once Lucca finishes her 
explanation, head back to the entrance of the castle and leave.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~5C.A Vanished Princess~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
If you didn't want to use the Bronze Armor on Crono, Lucca would also do
nicely with it to cover her inadequate Defense. Once ready, head south back
into Guardia Forest.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
You'll venture several more times through the forest, and nothing will ever
change in following trips. The fastest past to and from the entrance is the
far left path. If you hug the insides of the turns in the two clearings you
pass through, you'll avoid forced fights. I advise fighting here anyway
because you need to give Lucca Exp, and you could use a little more
traveling cash. The entrance is at the south, and it's easily visible on
the map. Head for it.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head right and to the Market. Purchase a Bronze Helm for Lucca if you 
didn't buy two of them when your first passed the Market, and if you have 
the funds go ahead and buy Lucca the Pea Shooter as well. If you can't
afford it, I advise going back to Guardia Forest and fighting a bit more
until you can. Or just sell unused equipment like the Wooden Sword and the
Hide Tunic/Armors. The Pea Shooter is only 800G, so selling all that old
equipment should be enough. Don't forget to stock up on a few Potions if 
you haven't already.

Once that's finished, head left of the entrance to Guardia Forest. You 
should be able to easily spot a small cathedral. Walk through the hole in 
the woods and enter Manolia Cathedral. Save before entering.

===========================
~Manolia Cathedral; 600 AD~
===========================
Head to the top left corner of the room and talk to the nun. After talking
to her a sparkly object will appear on the floor near her. Pick it up to
obtain a dropped hairpin. Once you do, all of the nuns in the room will 
rush over and attack you. The Naga's have a bit of HP, but you can Cyclone
both of the center Naga's and finish each off with Lucca. Cyclone is also
useful when they move around close to each other, making Cyclone deal 
damage to multiple foes. They also have an annoying tendency to inflict 
Slow status on you. Be patient.

Heal when needed. After you beat all four, another will spawn. You'll meet
up with Frog, and when you get the option, choose to let him join you. 
Rename him if you wish, and after that's over you should leave the 
cathedral and return to the Inn to heal. Or just use Potions here and save
yourself the time. Whichever you choose, play the organ at the top left
corner by examining it. This causes a door in the top right corner to
appear. Head through it.

Go through the doors right above you, then head up the stairs, fight the
enemies on the stairs, then go through the door right at the top of the
stairs. In this small room, talk to all of the enemies. Once you do, wait a
few seconds and one of them will leave. Exit the room and follow the enemy
down the hallway to the left and north, then into another room. In here is
the King, Queen Leene, and some soldier. Grab 100G and an ETHER from the
chests, then talk to all three of them. Attempt to leave and they will
fight you. Kill the trio of Vipers with ease.

Back in the main room, head south and down the stairs. Go back to the
entrance hallway. Head down to the left and pick up an ATHENIAN WATER and a
POTION from the chests. Fight the Diablos, then continue to the end of the
hallway. Go through the door, then up the staircase just like the other 
side of the room. Go through the door at the top and grab the MAIDEN'S
SUIT, POTION, and ETHER from the chests. Equip Lucca with the Maiden's
Suit. Examine the white egg thing on the left side of the room for a Naga's
Bromide, which triggers three Underlings to enter the room. Kill them all.

Leave the room and continue up the hallway. Grab the STEEL SABER from
the chest. Equip it on Crono. Head left, around the spikes, and press the
skull switch on the wall that has glowing red eyes. Once the spikes lower,
enter the room they were guarding. Talk to the soldiers, then examine the
sparkly thing in the trash can for a STRENGTH CAPSULE. Exit the room and 
head back downstairs.

Proceed up the center hallway, thrashing any enemies in the way, and 
through the door at the end. Enter the Main Menu first, go to Techs and
choose to use Frog's Slurp on your party to heal yourselves. Save at the
green sparkly circle on the left, then head up the stairs and go right. 
Try heading down the stairs and you'll find it was a trap and the stairs
retract under your feet, turning into a slide. Now you can't go back up 
them. 

Head through the door next to the stairs, then defeat the enemies in the
room. Press the skull switch on the wall here, then proceed through the
door (if you went down the left set of stairs from earlier, the switch is
also there, so you can press that one instead).

Head through the hallway, fight some enemies if you wish, and grab a 
PANACEA and POTION from the chests. Continue to the end of the hallway,
then head south into a similar room from earlier. Press the switch on the
wall if you want, fight some foes, then keep going south. Ignore the 
sleeping foe unless you want a fight, then head upstairs, go left for a
SHELTER in the chest, and finally through the wooden door here. With the 
spikes retracted you can fight the foes here. Use your Techs to wipe out 
the group here as quickly as possible. Cyclone and Flamethrower are great 
moves here.

Grab the IRON SWORD from the chest, then play the organ to make a door
appear in this area. Equip the Iron Sword on Frog, then head down either
the left or right stairs and proceed to the long hallway in the north. In
the middle of the hallway will be the newly created door. Head through
this last hallway, fight all the enemies for last minute Exp, and be sure
to stand in the save point. When you do, use a Shelter in your inventory
to heal everyone's HP and MP, then finally save. Enter the door. 

You'll find Queen Leene in here, and just in time. Looks like you're up
against your first boss.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Yakra
HP-920
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-50/TP-5/G-600

Techs:              Counters:
Scratch             Yakra Rage
Iron Sphere Blast
Needle Spin
Yakra Rumble

Recommended Levels-6+
----------------------------
If you fought almost all of the enemies in the cathedral, and have some
Potions, you should be capable of taking down Yakra. He has low Magic
Defense, just like most bosses in the game. Magic based Techs (at the end
of their description will be a magic symbol, like a fireball, shining
light, or a water drop) deal more damage than regular attacks and non-magic
Techs. Primarily use these attacks. Unless you really grinded, Lucca's 
Flamethrower (about 50 damage) and Lucca/Crono's Dual Tech Fire Whirl 
(about 110 damage) are your only magic moves. Use those attacks. Frog's 
duty is to Attack when everyone's in good shape, and use Slurp when 
someone gets low on HP and Ethers when MP is getting low on Crono/Lucca. 
Using X-Strike (Frog and Crono's Double Tech) does about 150 damage. It's 
also a good move.

If you attack Yakra and the initial attacker (such as if you used a Double
Tech with Lucca and Crono, and you chose the Tech from Lucca's menu) is
standing far from Yakra, he'll counter with a move that harms your entire
party. It does about 15 damage to everyone, but it adds up fast. Needle
Spin is a particuarily damaging attack, wasting away about 1/3rd one of
your members' HP. 

Use Athenian Waters if anyone faints, and Potions for everyone if multiple
members are at low HP. It should only take about 7 X-Strikes/Fire Whirls
and Yakra will fall. Not a hard battle unless you are very underleveled.
===========================================================================
After the fight, Leene will thank you for rescuing her. Grab a MID-ETHER 
from the right chest, and rescue the real Chancellor from the left chest.
Talk to Leene by the south door and you'll return to the castle.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
Once everyone is done talking, and Frog finishes sulking and leaves, head
up to the Queen's room where you first saw Marle disappear. With the 
timeline fixed she'll reappear in the same spot she disappeared. Choose
"Yes I would have" when asked if you'd still would have shown her around
the fair. 

Once she rejoins your party, return to the entrance of the castle. Talk 
with Frog and he will depart. Don't worry, he'll rejoin you later in the
game. Head down the left hallway and downstairs to rest and restore your
health. Once that's all done, leave the castle and head into Guardia 
Forest.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
Forest still hasn't, and really won't, change. Avoid or fight against the
encounters. Hug the inside of turns to avoid fights in clearings, and make
your way to the southern exit.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head right, back to Truce Canyon. Stop at the Market on the way and buy a
Bronze Helm for Marle, and a Padded Vest if you don't already have a spare
for her. Once she has some more Defense, head over to Truce Canyon.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~
======================
Make your way through the really short and linear area, get through the 
lone forced fight, and back to the area where the blue vortex spat you out
quite some time ago (it's directly right of the last ladder). You'll
encounter an odd blue sphere. Lucca pulls out a Gate Key, allowing these
blue Time Gates to stay open long enough so you can time travel through
them. You'll head in it, back to 1000 AD.

=======================
~Leene Square; 1000 AD~
=======================
Lucca will take her leave. You're now tasked with bringing Marle over to 
the castle so she can thank you properly. If you want to shell out 4000G on
Melchior's Silver Sword, feel free to. You probably have the dough now. 
Otherwise wait a little while and you'll get one for free from a chest. You
won't be in much combat until then so I say save your cash. Leave the
fairgrounds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             ~5D.Homecoming~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head over to the Market. Purchase an Iron Bowgun for Marle, as well as a
Maiden's Suit for her. With your tasks here complete, head left and into
Guardia Forest.

=========================
~Guardia Forest; 1000 AD~
=========================
Head north, then right at the split path. Then head for the bottom right
clearing. Fight the enemies here, then look at the top right nook in this
clearing to find a sparkly circle containing a STRENGTH CAPSULE. 

Head north, through another clearing, and eventually under a Gilded
Bellbird, who will ring for reinforcements in a fight. After you kill them
all off, head north and left, and engage the enemies in this clearing in
combat. After that, head right and then north at the split to get out of
the forest. Heal up with Potions or a Shelter, then enter Guardia Castle.

=========================
~Guardia Castle; 1000 AD~
=========================
Yeah, unlike in 600 AD you aren't going to get terribly far in the castle.
Hell, you won't even make it past the entrance hall. You'll be deemed a
terrorist for kidnapping Marle. Before you know it, you'll be held in 
trial. You're aiming for a not guilty verdict, of course. When asked, say
that you were responsible for initiating contact with Marle. The rest of
the trial is just some talking, and the little girl from the fair will 
testify good things about you if you brought her kitty back to her. And
when asked if greed tempted you to turn in Marle, choose that it didn't
tempt you both times you're asked.

Once that's all done, the seven jurors will determine your fate. Here's 
how to get each of them to say not guily. Keep in mind that all of these
events, bar two of them, were triggered during your first trip to the
Millenial Fair. If you didn't do them then, they'll likely say guilty.
1.Get the kitty back to the little girl
2.Talk to Marle after knocking her down before retreiving her pendant
3.Don't touch the pink bag near the entrance of Gato's area
4.Talk with Melchior, but tell him you won't try selling Marle's pendant
(I am also led to believe that simply not talking to Melchior after getting
the pendant also results in not guilty)
5.Don't move while waiting for Marle to get candy
6.During the trial, admit you hit Marle and deny that you had greed in mind
7.One of the jurors is glitched (as far as everyone knows), and randomly 
chooses guilty or not guilty

Regardless of the outcome, you'll be thrown into jail for three days. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ~5E.The Trial~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================
~Prison Towers; 1000 AD~
========================
Drink the coffee cup to restore HP and MP, and grab the pink bag. You'll
be given Ethers based on how many jurors deemed you not guilty--4 for 1, 5
for 2, 6 for 3, and all 7 nets you 6 Ethers. Save at the save point. Now,
you have two options for busting out of jail. One is quicker, but nets
virtually no Exp, while the other is longer but will get you a lot more 
Exp (and for the record, a boss is up ahead). Take your pick.

**The Quick Escape
Walk into the cell door and Crono will bang on it. Ignore the guards 
telling you to shut up. Bang on it again, and repeat a third time. Now one
of the guards will enter your cell and thwack you. As he slowly walks back
out, walk behind him and hit A to knock him unconcious. Exit the cell and
fight the other guard.

Now that you're out, head right and into the next room. Here there are 
three staircases you can choose. Attack both Sentries (you can only deal
large amounts of damage to them when their masks are tilted right and the
white eyes behind them are visible). Then head up the top right stairs.
You'll be outside. Cross the long bridge, attack the two guards that try to
stop you, then enter the room on the other side.

You'll spot a guard up ahead. If you can run to him when his back is turned
and press the A button, you'll kill him without battling him, although no
Exp will be won. Do as you wish, then head north and left. Kill the guard
here by any means necessary, then head left up the stairs.

You'll be outside again. Head across the bridge and back inside. Kill the
Sentries, then go up the top right staircase. Head up the stairs in this
next room and you'll appear near two guards. Kill them both, then head
through the only door in the room. You'll appear back in the warden's
office. He'll freak and attempt to get help, only for Lucca to bust in. A
save point will appear near his desk once Lucca finishes speaking. Try
talking to the collapsed warden to swipe five Mid-Potions off of him.

**The Long and Rewarding Escape
Wait out the three days in your cell. You'll be alerted when a day passes
(each "day" takes about 20-30 seconds). Once the three days have passed, 
you will be escorted by the guards to the guillotine. Just when you think
you're a goner, Lucca will burst in to save you. This is what makes this
path much better-you're as far away from the end of the dungeon as possible
and you have Lucca with you to also gain Exp. Nice. Grab the BRONZE ARMOR
from the chest.

Head south and to the next room. Grab the MID-POTION from the chest, then
talk to the man on the guillotine to free him. Head south and out of the
execution cell. Examine the collapsed guard to earn a free Mid-Potion. 
Ignore the north path for now if you don't want some goodies remaining in
the prison (if you wish to skip the goodies, move down to the next section
indented with **). Head down the hallway to the left, kill the guard, and 
exit the room further left.

Run across the bridge and two guards will attack you. Dispatch them then
continue left into the next room of the prison. Ignore the Sentries and
go up the stairs in the top left corner. Press the switches near each of
the cell doors to open both of them. If you go in the right one and try to
leave, the Lancer will awaken and attack you. The left cell door doesn't
open all the way, so head right and exit the room.

Back in the room with four staircases, fight the Sentries. Wait until they
tilt their heads and expose the white eyes before attacking them 
(otherwise they'll take very little damage). Head through the bottom left
stairs to appear near your starting cell. Heal and save, then go back to
the previous room and take the bottom right stairs. 

Head across the bridge, and in the next room kill the guard. Hit the 
switch on the wall to open the cell. Go inside to find four chest 
containing 2 ETHERS and 2 MID-POTIONS. Head back left to the room with
four staircases (you'll encounter a Gaoler on your way). Take the top 
right staircase now. Head across the bridge and in the next hallway kill 
the guard. 

**Now that we've looped back here, head up the north hallway and then left.
Kill the guard blocking the staircase, then head up them. Run left across
the bridge, then in the next room head down the bottom left staircase. Flip
the right switche to open the right cell, grab the SHELTER from the chest 
in the right cell, then leave the room.

Take the top right stairs after killing the Sentries. Enter the left cell
and walk through the hole in the wall to appear outside. You can climb up
and down these walls. Walk right and hold down to climb downwards. When you
land on the ledge below, head left and climb down the small gap between the
two ledges. On the next ledge, walk right and climb down to a ledge with
an opening. Walk into it and grab the SHELTER from a chest. 

Examine the hole in the top left of this cell to climb down it. In the cell
you land in open the chests for 1500G and a SILVER SWORD. See, told ya you
would get a freebie sometime later. Equip that baby on Crono. With that
done, examine the wall in the top left corner to climb up the hole. Then
go through the hole in the wall and climb back up the wall.

Back in this upper cell, leave this room. Back in the staircases room, take
the top right stairs. Head up the next staircase in this small room, then
through the nearby wooden door to end up in the warden's office.

--->And this is where both paths end up. Regardless of which you chose, 
save at the save point and use a Shelter there. Be sure to read the fallen
note next to the warden for tips on the obvious upcoming boss. Examine the
warden for 5 Mid-Potions if you haven't already, then head up the stairs at
the top of the room. Head across the bridge all the way to the end.

Recommended Levels-7+
----------------------------
An incredibly annoying fight if you're unlucky. If you read the note the 
warden had, you already know that you should simply attack the Head of the
Dragon Tank with non-magic Techs. Crono's Cyclone Tech and Lucca's normal 
attack is best to use against the Head.

The Head is really obnoxious as it can heal all body parts about 70 HP. The
annoying part is it can use this multiple times in a row if you're unlucky.
Every few attacks the wheels will store a charge. A turn or two later the
Dragon Tank will charge at you, dealing over 40 damage to your team. 

Overall, kill the Head first because of it's repair ability. This can be
practically impossible if it spams the hell out of Repair Body. It can heal
twice before Crono can use Cyclone, and Cyclone at this point can only do
about 150 damage. So you essentially aren't dealing damage to it if the
tank spams its heal ability. During this time, have Lucca heal herself and
Crono, and restore his MP for Cyclone when it gets low. 

Once the Head is finally destroyed, things get much easier. Blast the Body
with Fire Whirl, Wind Slash, and Flamethrower. When the Body is killed,
finish off what little HP the Wheel has to win the battle.
===========================================================================
Once the tank explodes, walk across the bridge the soldiers and Chancellor
make into the next room. Grab the SHELTER from the chest, then run down all
the flights of stairs until you notice the floor with two soldiers
guarding the stairs. Once they notice you, make a bolt for the exit of the
castle. You just won't be able to escape, but luckily Marle will bail you
out.

=========================
~Guardia Forest; 1000 AD~
=========================
With nowhere else to run, head all the way right to a clearing. Luckily for
you there happens to be a Time Gate here. Enter it once you get the chance.

===================
~Bangor Dome; ? AD~
===================
You'll appear in an odd metallic place. After the conversation ends, leave
to the south.

                           ~5F.Beyond the Ruins~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
~World Map; ? AD~
=================
Wow, this place is really depressing. Let's start by getting more info on
where we are. Head into Trann Dome, just south if your current location.

==================
~Trann Dome; ? AD~
==================
Talk to the first man in here. Say you have cash and you can buy some stuff
from him. Stock up on a few Mid-Potions and Athenian Waters for the road.
Get the Pocket Blaster for Lucca, and Iron Helms and Suits for your entire
party. If you can't afford them, get them at least for Marle and Lucca. 
Crono has enough Defense to suffice for now (don't forget to sell all your
unused and now obsolete equipment for some extra cash).

After that, talk to everyone, then enter the metallic Enertron on the far
left. It fully heals you for free. Nice. With that done, leave the dome.

=================
~World Map; ? AD~
=================
Head all the way north and a bit to the right until you reach the ruins of
Site 16.

===============
~Site 16; ? AD~
===============
Head all the way to the right, then north a bit to find a chest containing
a BERSERKER RING. Try your best to dodge the rats in the site because
touching one makes them steal a Potion. If you have no Potions, they'll
steal 500G. You probably won't want that happening. After getting the 
chest, return to the left and proceed north.

When you reach a small area with a bunch of enemies, you can choose to
fight them all or avoid them via a small nook on the right. Be careful of
the rat if you do so. Heading right regardless of what you did, you'll be
ambushed just before you can reach the chest. Kill the foes, grab the 
SILVER SWORD from the chest, useful if you didn't get on the Guardia 
Prison, then head north. Dodge more rats, head left for a chest with a 
SILVER BOW inside (equip on Marle). Then head south.

Fight the enemies here in this clearing, then head left and north. Defeat
the five Craters, then proceed down to the right, avoiding the rat, and to
the next screen. Here you will be forced into a fight with three Specters.
They can only be hurt by your magic based Techs. If you can't use 
Flamethrower or Wind Slash, you can't really beat this fight. Use Ethers
to restore MP if needed. If you lack MP in the battle, just run away.

Head south. In the bottom left corner of the area is a chest with an ETHER
inside. Head right for a fight against more Specters, or slightly north and
right to fight a Mutant. Head for the top right corner's exit, fight a
second Mutant, then get out of here. 

=================
~World Map; ? AD~
=================
Still clueless as to where we are, head south into Arris Dome.

==================
~Arris Dome; ? AD~
==================
Follow the map on the touch screen to work your way through this moderately
linear maze of walkways until you reach the small area with a bunch of
dishelved people. After the old man mentions you, talk to everyone here to
learn about their current predicament, rest at the Enertron and save at the
save point on the left, then talk to the old man again. You'll be told that
there is a food storage facility in this dome. If only you could reach it.

Head down the ladder south of Doan. There is a door on the right, however
it is currently blocked off and you need a password to get by. Instead,
head left and up the ladder. You'll be on a large series of catwalks. 
Follow the simple path to the top right corner of the room. Refer to the
touch screen map if needed. In the next room a siren will be going off. 
Head north and a large machine will attack you.

Laser (Shadow Tech) 

Guardian/Pod Combo Counters:
Amplifier (Shadow Tech)
Delta Attack (Shadow Tech)

Recommended Levels-8+
----------------------------
A really easy fight if you know what to do. If you don't, you're going to
be killed in seconds. Essentially, do not attack the Guardian at all. You
must kill the two Pods first, otherwise they will annihilate your party.
If both Pods are still up, the Delta Attack counter used when Guardian is
hurt will easily do about 100 damage to your whole team. Amplifier, used
when only one Pod is left as well as sometimes as a normal attack, does
about 50 damage to one of your characters.

Obviously enough you need to kill the pair of Pods. They have little HP, so
it will only take a few Flamethrowers and Wind Slashes to take each down.
Make sure Marle heals the party whenever necessary. Once both Pods are 
down you can freely attack the Guardian. After an attack or two it will
start counting down from 5. It'll likely attack you every now and then, but
it won't be terribly strong. 

When the counter reaches 0, the Pods will get revived and you'll need to
repeat the process of destroying them. You should be able to kill the
Guardian the second time you destroy the Pods if you're at a good level and
you're using Wind Slash, or other strong Techs. Keep in mind that it
absorbs Fire Techs, so Flamethrower is useless against the Guardian.
===========================================================================
After the relatively easy fight, head north to the room it was guarding.
Sadly, all the food has gone rotten, so there's nothing left but a seed. 
Examine the man again to find out the rat is hiding a secret. Hmm. Open the
chest next to him for a MID-ETHER, then leave south. Head south again to be
back in the catwalks room.

Now you need to chase the rate running about the catwalks. He's fast, and
if you get too slown down you won't reach him before he gets off the
screen. If that happens, leave and reenter the catwalks room for another
shot at grabbing him. All you need to do is run behind him and press the A
button. Not terribly hard if you don't go the wrong way on the catwalks.

You find out the password this way. You'll end up back in the room with the
panels that were password controlled. Move to the sparkling switch and hold
the L and R buttons, then press A to open a path to the door on the right
(you should head back up the ladder on the right to heal at the Enertron 
and save).

Attack the enemies and head north to a chest with a MID-ETHER. Then head 
back near the entrance and head up the stairs on the left to the metal
gratings. Follow this trail all the way north, then head down the stairs
on the right. Now you'll have to make your way down south in this room. 
There are a ton of Bugs in the way, but they are quite weak. Head right up
the stairs onto another metal grating at the end, then head north and 
through the door at the end.

Attack the Version 2.0 in here, then head all the way to the right and 
fight several Shadows (merely Specters with more HP). Head north and attack
all of the rats and an Exterminator. After that, head left until you reach
a roaming Version 2.0. Kill that, then head left onto the metal grating. 
Loop around to a door and head through to find the supercomputer. 

You'll find out the nearest Time Gate is in the Proto Dome to the east. 
You'll also discover just where you are--2300 AD, long after the menace
Lavos has destroyed the world. Head south out of the room once that's all
over. Head left, over the metal grating, then proceed south. Head right on
some metal grating, then follow them as they go around a wall and back 
left. You'll be at the bottom left corner of the room, so leave.

Head right on the metal grating, then head south. Head back north along 
solid ground, then left and south upon more metal grating. You'll be at the
entrance of the room, so leave. Now head up the ladder in the bottom right
corner of this room to be back at the surface. Talk with Doan and the 
survivors to give them the bad news about the food. 

He'll give you a Jetbike Key to help you get through Site 32, the area that
blocks you and Proto Dome. Walk into the top left survivor to make him back
up so you can get out of here. Rest at the Enertron and leave the dome.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head north and right into Site 32. The dome on the right, just south of the
site is the Abandoned Sewers. If you're willing to head down, you'll get a
decent amount of Exp as well as some nifty goodies. This is completely
optional, and you're not forced to come here until later in the game. Like
WAY later. If you're not up to it, just skip down to Site 32.

===========================
~Abandoned Sewers; 2300 AD~
===========================
Move down the ladder and an enemy will spot you, heading off to alert
Krawlie about you. We'll worry about that later. Head right, fight a group
of enemies. Defeat them all quickly because the group can pile on damage
quick, then grab 600G from the chest. Head back to the beginning, but head
left now. Kill the pair of Dondragos, then head down the south path.

You'll see two enemies converse before they head down a ladder. Follow them
to the ladder they went down, then go down it. Head right once you get to
the bottom. Along this long waterside path, if you examine any of the items
you will get attacked, Good for Exp if you want it, but if you don't want
to waste your time with these fights then proceed through the hallway
without examining anything (and that includes not touching the fake save
point). You'll fight 2-4 Dondragos for each trap you set off.

At the end of the pathway, head up the ladder. Fight the pair of Egg Oozes
when you get to the top, then proceed north. You should see a hallway on 
the right that makes you think you should be able to pass through it but 
can't. There's an invisible wall slightly south of it. Run through the wall
and flip the switch at the end to open the door on the right.

Head back through the wall, then go all the way north, right through the
wall, north, right through another invisible wall, then south and through
the open door. Ignore the pair of enemies that keep chattering, then head
north. Grab the RAGE BAND from the chest, then go right. You will fight 
Krawlie when you enter the small clearing. He's not a challenge, really.
He has an obnoxious attack that will bring you down to 1 HP, and the rest
of his attacks do moderate damage. He has really low HP, so thwack him with
a few magic Techs and the battle will be won.

Once that's out of the way, head south, fight the group of enemies in the
forced encounter, then keep on going south. Once you reach the bottom, head
left. Ignore the first ladder; it takes you to the World Map in an area 
that you can't do anything with for a long time. Head left and north 
instead, and grab the THUNDER BLADE from the chest. Equip it on Crono right
now. 

Flip the switch on the left to make a bridge appear. Go across it, then
head all the way north and left across another newly made bridge. Head 
north, then right and you'll land up back at the ladder leading back to the
Overworld, with a new weapon for Crono and a good amount of Exp in tow.
Head to Site 32 now.

==================
~Site 32; 2300 AD~
==================
Grab the chest on the right containing a MID-POTION, then head north and 
attempt starting the jetbike. A group of Exterminators will appear...only 
for Bro "Johnny" to come in. He'll challenge you to a jetbike race. If you
don't know what to do, he'll ask if you if you want instructions or not. 
Basically in this short minigame both of you are racing to the end of the 
highway, naturally. There's no acceleration or brakes--just pure speed. 
Both of you will constantly pass each other. You can only move up and down,
and you want to get ahead of Johnny to block him from passing you while 
dodging his attempts to do the same.

You can press the B button to boost, but you only get 3 boosts. Each boost
has a charge time of about 3 seconds. The race is about 30 seconds long,
and your position on the track is on the bottom of the screen. 

You HAVE to win the race in order to stay on the other side of Site 32.
Otherwise you'll just have to try again. Use a boost right at the end for
a generally ensured victory. Or, if you absolutely cannot win, leave the
screen to the right of the jetbike and walk through Site 32. There's a
bunch of enemies, so it's good for Exp if you're lacking it.

Once you reach the other side of the site via either method, head south and
leave.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head right and then south to the Proto Dome.

=====================
~Proto Dome; 2300 AD~
=====================
Head left, fight the enemies, then head north for more enemies to fight.
Once everything is dead, rest in the nearby Enertron and head onto the
metal grating on the right. Follow it north until you reach a broken robot.
Examine it and Lucca will set out to repair it. Enjoy his funky beat once
he awakens, then choose to rename Robo if you wish.

The door at the top of the room can't even be budged by Robo. It needs 
power, which is supplied by the nearby factory. One of your partners needs
to stay behind, though. If you keep Marle behind, you'll lose your healer
in your party, but trade that for powerful magic attacks. Leave Lucca 
behind and your party will be easily healed by Marle, which you'll need
when you take longer to kill foes. I prefer keeping Marle behind. Your 
call.

With Robo in tow, head south and leave the dome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~5G.The Derelict Factory~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head right and up north to the building you ignored just a little while
ago. This is the Derelict Factory, so naturally you'll want to enter it.

===========================
~Derelict Factory; 2300 AD~
===========================
Examine the computer infront of you and Robo will toy with it a bit,
disabling the red laser guarding the northbound converyor belt on the 
right. An Acid will attack you after doing so. These guys have insane
Defense, but low HP, so a few basic attacks will take them down. With the 
laser gone, head up the belt on the right and fight the enemies on the 
left.

You have a choice now. Those glowing green spaces on the left and right are
elevators. Flip the switches behind them to go down. You'll need a password
up ahead on the left elevator, and you find it through the room the right
elevator leads you to. However, you don't need to find the password in
order to use it. Thusly, you can skip the right elevator's room. But there
are a few items and some Exp to be had, so the call is yours. Move down to
the paragraph indented with an arrow if you want to skip the right 
elevator's path.

You'll appear in the factory area. Head south down a ladder, then ignore 
the next ladder and head left and north. Head up the ladder up here to 
enter a hallway you can't see, then head north into a wall, then move
right. When you reach a dead end, examine the spot for a chest holding a
MID-ETHER. Head left and south, down the ladder again, then south and right
again. 

Head down the right ladder and follow the path through the door. A crane 
will pick up your party and drop you on a converyor belt. You will go 
through three consectutive fights, with one, three, and five enemies in 
each one respectively. The Deverminators have a decent amount of HP, so lay
them to rest with strong Techs to get through the fights quickly. After the
fights you will end up in the bottom left corner of the factory. Exit 
through the indent in the wall in the south. Just keep walking south in 
that little nook and you'll find the exit sooner or later.

In this next room, heal up and then take on the group of Bugs to access 
the ladder. Head up it, then go through the door at the top. You'll be some
catwalks above the conveyor belts. Head north, then right to a chest with a
MID-POTION. Head inside the door next to the chest. Examine the computer in
this room to discover two password codes:XA and BB. Keep these in mind. 
Both Version 3.0's that were on the wall will walk around the room now. 
Fight them if you wish, but be sure to grab the 400G and MID-ETHER from the
two chest on the right.

Head back to the main factory room, then head left and enter the door 
there. Fight both Version 3.0's in this room, then both Deverminators, and
finally grab the SHELTER and ETHER, then head out the bottom left exit. 
You will appear at the crane control panel. You'll be instructed to input
the control codes, one button at a time, after the ding. 

Wait for the ding and then hit the X button, then the A button. The crane
will remove one of the red barrels that formerly blocked your path.
Examine the control panel again, this time inputting the B button twice.
The crane repeats the process for another barrel. You're all done here, so
head back to the previous room, dodge the Version 3.0's, and through the
bottom right exit. 

Head down the far left ladder. At the bottom, follow the path to the left
until you reach the door in the top left corner of the factory room. Enter
it and turn on the computer to reveal to ultra-secret security code:XABY.
With that in mind, grab the THUNDER BLADE from the chest (you'll already
have one if you did the Abandoned Sewers), and exit the room. Follow the 
pathway all the way to the right, passing the ladder you used a few seconds
ago, and go up the ladder at the end.

Head south and you'll be near the two ladders at the start of the room. You
took the right one a long time ago, so now take the left one. Walk to the
chest at the end for a BANDIT'S BOW. Equip that on Marle (you can equip
items on characters regardless if they're in your current party). Head back
right, up the ladder, then up the ladder right above that and head north
to leave the room via the elevator. Take the left elevator back in the
entrance room to the Derelict Factory.

--->Down here, if you went to the factory area be sure to use a Shelter at
the save point. Save, then head through the door on the left and head 
north. Fight the few enemies guarding the computer, then examine the now
turned on computer. A nearby hatch will open, revealing a ladder in the
bottom right corner. Grab the SHELTER from the chest before heading down
the ladder.

Head left through this hallway, fight the few enemies you come across, then
follow the path all the way south. Then head right through the hallway 
until you get blocked by a laser. Enter the door to the north, grab the 
chest containing a TITANIUM VEST in the top right corner (you can walk 
behind the structure seemingly blocking it). Lucca or Marle could use that
vest. Grab the HAMMER ARM from the chest in the bottom right. Good new
weapon for Robo.

Examine the computer in the top left corner of this small room. Robo will
disable the laser systems in the facility. A group of five enemies will
ambush you, so kill them all off for a good amount of Exp. With this done,
I advise heading out of this small room, head right in the hallway and take
the elevator up to the save point, save, then return back to this room 
because there is a boss fight up ahead.

After doing that or not, head down the ladder the bottom left corner of
the computer room, or take the elevator down to the bottom floor. Head up
the long hallway and grab the PLASMA GUN from the chest. After equipping
that on Lucca, examine the computer and you'll need to input the password.
If you went through the factory area, you'll know what it is. After the 
ding, press X, A, B, Y in that order. If you didn't do the factory...well,
that's the password. I said that part was optional after all.

Head through the now opened door and flip the switch on the large machine.
With the security system haywire, get the hell out of here. Go south,
through all the closing doors, then up the ladder on the left. Exit the
computer room to the south, then follow the hallway left and north. A bunch
of blue robots will appear and bash up Robo. There's nothing you can do but
watch. After a bit, they'll shove him up a chute, then attack you.

Recommended Levels-11+
----------------------------
Pretty annoying boss fight if you're underleveled, not to mention you lose
Robo for the fight. If you have Marle, she'll primarily be healing the
group. If you have Lucca, both of you will occasionally need to use Mid-
Potions, but the pair of you can unleash a lot of damage with powerful
Techs and end the battle fast.

Of note is that they are weak to Light magic, so Crono's Wind Slash (try to
select an enemy that has an enemy also in the line of fire that also gets
hit by the blast) will do a lot of damage. Lucca's Flamethrower as well.
Marle can't really do much to these guys.

Mainly focus on one of them at a time. Individually they won't cause a ton
of damage, but all six attacking you, each doing around 25 damage, adds up
very quickly. Don't worry about those counters--they are hardly used 
(although they all do around 50 damage if you see them, primarily used when
the group is down to one or two foes left). 

Once you get down to about two or three of them the remainder of the fight
gets considerable easier, and you'll be poised for victory.
===========================================================================
You'll escape the Derelict Factory. Nice not making us go back through the
rest of it!

=====================
~Proto Dome; 2300 AD~
=====================
Lucca will repair a battered Robo, and the door to the north becomes 
accessable. Head inside to find the Time Gate. Finally we can get out of
this depressing dump.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Much more peaceful place. Hm? This isn't 1000 AD and whatnot? Yeah, true.
Head right and talk to the sleeping man. The man will explain the situation
to you, saying that it's impossible to continue your journey with more than
three people. Thusly, you can only ever have a three-man party. You must
keep one member behind. I prefer to keep Lucca and Robo, Robo for power and
Lucca so she can learn new Techs (which become available shortly). Don't 
forget you can switch party members in the main menu at any time.

                           ~5H.The End of Time~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Grab the sparkle above the save point to replenish your HP and MP. Then 
try heading back towards the blue portals where you started. The old man
will call for you, so head back over and talk to him. He'll tell you to
head inside the door behind him. You don't have a choice in this matter. Do
as he says.

Talk to the creature Spekkio in here. Regardless of whether he looks strong
or weak to you, he mentions that you all possess a type of magic within
you. Crono has Light, Lucca Fire, Marle Water, and Robo is magicless, but 
several of his Techs inflict Shadow magic type damage. In order to learn
magic, you'll need to run clockwise (from the bottom, that'd be moving left
then up, right, and back down) around the room three times. Start at the
bottom right corner. Move right past the door, then up the wall, right
across the wall, then south back to the starting point. When you pass the
door on this lap, count 1 in your head. Repeat twice more, then after
pasing it the third time go talk to Spekkio.

If done right he'll grant your team magic abilities. You can now start
learning magic Techs, which will prove invaluable later in the game. Agree
to try it out in a test fight against him. Spekkio proves to be 
surprisingly strong. He has low Magic Defense, but really high Defense.
Obviously, stick with magic Techs. 

If you manage to beat him, and it can be tough (don't worry--if you get
killed there's no game over, you'll just be fully healed right away. It's
a test fight after all), Spekkio will hand over a special set of items.
They vary depending on Spekkio's current form. His form changes into 
stronger and stronger versions depending on your highest character's level.
You'll probably get the Refresher Set, containing a Magic Capsule and 5
Ethers at this point in the game. Dump that Magic Capsule into Robo. 

May not make sense, but Robo is a really good healer when he gets more
Techs, and that runs off the Magic stat. He needs all the boosts he can 
get. If you hate Robo, Crono should get it instead. Light is the most
powerful magic type, but his Magic stat is pretty poor. Spekkio notes that
you should bring him any new party members you obtain so they can be
taught magic (no need to run around the room either!). Do this with Marle
or Lucca right now if one of them isn't in your current party.

Exit Spekkio's room and talk to the old man. He advises that you head back
to 1000 AD. Also, see the bucket on the right? Leads to the final boss. You
probably don't wanna enter that. The portal just left of the door to 
Spekkio leads to the Arena of Ages. It's a new area for the DS version of
Chrono Trigger. See that section if you're interested in it.

For now, head left and go to the portal leading to Medina Village, 1000 AD.

=========================
~Medina Village; 1000 AD~
=========================
You'll appear out of a closet. Neato. Try leaving and one of the Imps will
warn you of this area and how many of them aren't terribly friendly 
towards humans. Leave the house.

                           ~5I.Fiendish Folk~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head to Medina Square, the sparkling spot right near you. This is optional,
and it merely says a little tidbit on Lavos and the fiendlord Magus. After
going through here or not, proceed left on the World Map. You'll find a 
lone cabin belonging to Melchior out here. Talk to him inside and choose to
look at his wares. He's got good new weapons for everyone except Robo 
(assuming you picked up his Hammer Arm in the Derelict Factory). He also 
has Titanium Vests. At the least get them for the female you're primarily 
using in your party. Also get more Mid-Potions if you're low on them.

When all's said and done, leave his cabin and head to the mountains 
directly behind it. Enter Heckran Cave here.

=======================
~Heckran Cave; 1000 AD~
=======================
You'll get attacked as soon as you enter the cavern. Proceed along the 
linear path, then head down a ladder. Grab an ETHER from the chest, then
head down another ladder. Move left and you'll get attacked by a large 
group of enemies. Use an attack all attack like Supersonic Spin to wipe
them all out quickly. The Djinn Bottle can steal MP from you, so make it 
your primary target first. Once that threat is over, head down the stairs 
in the bottom left.

Head south into a clearing to fight some Rhino Weevils. They are resistant
to normal attacks, so use magic Techs here. Once killed, proceed all the
way south and through a doorway. In this small area head left to get 
attacked by some Boundillos. They aren't a huge threat. Once eliminated, 
head left to the end of the room and fight a trio of Cave Bats. These are
also resistant to normal damage, so more magic to be used here. Grab the
MAGIC SCARF, then head right and back to the previous room.

This time head left at the clearing, grab the chest with a MID-ETHER 
inside, then head north to another clearing and, as guessed, another forced
fight. Use a Supersonic Spin to wipe them all out quick. Once killed, head
north to find a chest with an ETHER inside, then head back all the way
south and through a doorway.

Fight more foes not long into this room, proceed left through the hallway,
up the stairs, and then left more and into a fight with some Cave Bats.
Afterwards, head through the doorway. Head north and fight the enemies in
this room if you wish. Ignore the sealed black chest by the doorway at the
end.

Back in the room with the rushing water, step down the stairs onto it. Head
right, walk under the pathways, and head north up some stairs and onto dry
ground. Use a Shelter at the save point just before the stairs leading to 
the next room. Once you've saved, go through them. Not long after entering
the next room you'll fight the boss.

Nereid Cyclone (Water Tech)   

Recommended Levels-12+
----------------------------
That beastly Defense is nothing to scoff at. You'll struggle to deal more
than single digit damage with regular attacks, so stick with your magic
Techs. Don't use Dual Techs here--damage output with individual single
magic Techs outweighs damage with magic Dual Techs.

Nereid Cyclone and Yah! are dangerous attacks, and can easily lower one of
your party member's HP by half. Keep Mid-Potions on hand, or heal with 
Marle if she's in your party.

Midway through the fight Heckran will state "Go ahead and attack, see what
it gets you!" and change stances. Obviously, don't attack him. He'll 
counterattack with the powerful Water II Tech. Use this time to heal your 
party. When he gives up his gambit by disengaging his counterattack stance,
resume pounding him with magic Techs. It's not a very hard fight. None of 
his attacks, save the easily avoidable Water II move when he's in 
counterattack mode, will hit the entire party. 
===========================================================================
Once the fight is over, head north to a small pool of water. Try walking 
into it, and choose to jump in. 

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
You'll end up being spit out next to Lucca's House. Enter it and go through
the door at the north end, then up the right stairs. Talk to Lucca's mom 
and her father will appear. Head back downstairs when he leaves and talk to
her father Taban near the entrance to receive Taban's Vest. Equip it on 
Lucca right away.

Leave her house and head north to the Market. If you helped Fritz escape
Guardia Prison way back when, he'll hand you 10 Mid-Ethers. Really useful
things. Stock up on any extra supplies you may need, then head into the
Leene Square.

=======================
~Leene Square; 1000 AD~
=======================
Nothing special is going on still that pertains to you. Make your way to 
the back end of the fair once again and enter the Time Gate.

Take the top left portal to Truce Canyon.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~

You should know this place pretty well. Up the ladder, fight easy enemies,
head south and get out of here. Nothing hard.

Head all the way left and then south to find Zenan Bridge. Enter it.

======================
~Zenan Bridge; 600 AD~
======================
A group of knights will block access to the bridge, but you can still talk
to the commander in gold armor. He'll state provisions have yet to arrive
from the castle. Our next destination should be pretty obvious.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head to the forest.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
You've been here enough to know the layout. Head left and north along the
slightly winding trail. You'll appear back on the World Map at the end.
Enter the castle once you make it.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
Once the guards clear you for access in the castle, head down the right
hallway, up north, and down the stairs at the end. You'll be in the 
kitchen. Head south and talk to the head chef who is running about 
furiously. Once him and his wife stop arguing, leave the kitchen and head 
to the exit of the casltle.

Before you make it the chef will come up to you, handing you Spiced Jerky
for the troops, as well as a Strength Capsule for you. Once the chef takes
his leave again, exit the castle and head back to the forest.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
Head south back to Zenan Bridge. Be sure to save and heal with a Shelter if
necessary. A boss fight is approaching.

======================
~Zenan Bridge; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the commander and give him the food. Not long after this Magus will
launch an attack on the bridge. Follow the bridge left and you'll end up
battling two Skeletons. Don't bother attacking Ozzie as it won't get you
anywhere. Magic Techs are the only attacks that can deal a ton of damage to
these guys, so be sure to use them. Shadow Techs heal these guys, so don't
use much from Robo.

A few seconds after they're dead, Ozzie will run to the left. Chase after
him to fight three more Skeletons. Repeat the same process here. Follow
Ozzie further left once this group is dead and he will summon a group of
Skeletons that will combine into Zombor.

Recommended Levels-13+
----------------------------
Each part of the body gets healed by two different magic types. Don't use
hit all magic Techs as you'll just end up healing one of the parts of the
body. Start with the Lower Body first as it has fewer HP. Lucca and Crono
are capable of pounding on the Lower Body, and will drain its HP with
Lightning and Fire really fast. 

It should only take a few attacks to kill the Lower Body. By now you'll
probably have been hit by Zombor's Annihilation Ray, which deals around 90
damage to your entire party. It's quite devastating, so spend a turn 
healing or use Marle's healing Techs to get everyone back to high HP.

Once everyone gets back to high HP, finish off the Lower Body. The Upper
Body is only weak to Robo's Shadow Techs. Everyone else should use normal
attacks or magicless Techs. Don't forget to keep healing when Annihilation
Ray gets used, and you'll get through the battle without too much of an
issue.
===========================================================================
Once you get through the battle, leave the bridge to the left.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Stop by the Market just to the south and grab more Mid-Potions. Head into
the Residence and talk to the old man on the left. Agree to give him the 
Naga Bromide and he'll unlock the dresser left of the fireplace. Open it to
grab a Magic Capsule. Very nice. With business in this village done, head
south until you reach another village by the ocean. 

Go to the north point of the village and head left, then follow the path
left of the village and to the Cursed Woods.

======================
~Cursed Woods; 600 AD~
======================
Grab the MID-POTION from the chest on the right. Proceed north through the
linear forest. Get a SHELTER from another chest on the right in the middle
of the forest, then continue to the end. There's a hidden ladder behind the
suspicious bush at the end. Head down it.

After getting down the ladder you'll find out that this is Frog's abode.
Talk with him until he gets depressed saying that he's no hero. With that,
grab the MAGIC SCARF from the chest in the top right, leave his home, head
south, and get out of the forest.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head north and into Fiona's Villa. Grab the pair of MID-ETHERS from the two
chests in her room. Leave, then head northeast to found some mountains. 
Enter Denadoro Mountains. Make sure Lucca is in your party as she is 
insanely useful in this mountain range.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================
~Denadoro Mountains; 600 AD~
============================
Grab 300G from the chest on the left, then fight the enemies and proceed
north. Just before reaching a ladder you'll get into a scene with a small
kid. Fight the Ogan that followed him, then a Hammer Ogan. These guys have
insane Defense, but if you burn the hammer away with one of Lucca's fire
Techs, then they turn into normal Ogans with pitiful Defense. Keep it in
mind (these guys are common in this area).

After the young kid gets off screen, head up the ladder. On the next 
screen, walk off the screen in the bottom left (just left of the top of the
ladder) to appear back on the first screen, but on the high ledge next to
the ladder. Grab the ATHENIAN WATER from the chest, the walk back to the
previous screen. Examine the Ogan, then head north and you'll fight him and
a Freelancer.

Once killed, head north for real, go across a bridge, and up a ladder to
end up fighting two Ogans. Burn off the hammer of one of them, then pound
them both with ease. Grab 500G from the chest behind where they were, then
head right across a bridge and then follow the path south. A hammer Ogan
will ambush you. Burn and kill, then go up the ladder and proceed north all
the way to the next screen.

Head right, then at the split path take the left one to a dead end with a
MID-ETHER in a chest. Go back to the split and take the right path. Defeat
the pair of Freelancers guarding the chest holding an ATHENIAN WATER, then
go up the ladder. Grab the GOLDEN HELM from another chest before going up
the next ladder (equip on Crono, or Robo if you really want to). Burn and
kill another hammer Ogan, then head left for a fight with another one and a
Freelancer. 

Follow the path south to a dead end with a MID-POTION in a chest, then go
back north and left off the screen. You'll be out of the trees and near a
waterfall. Head north up the ladders quickly. A Freelancer is flinging
rocks at you, and they hurt you for 5 HP if you get it. Grab a MID-ETHER 
from the chest, then head right off the screen at the top of last ladder.

Head right, burn and kill the hammer Ogan and Freelancer, then go up the
ladder. Grab 600G from the chest on the right, then keep moving north.
Before getting off the screen, be sure to heal all of your HP. The next
screen hosts a series of four consecutive battles, all with Ogans, hammer
Ogans, Freelancers, or a mix of them. It's not hard if you have Lucca with
Fire. If you still aren't using her, prepare to use a lot of MP using Techs
to take down those hammer Ogans.

After the last fight, head left off the screen and you'll be higher up the
waterfall. Get the chest just below you for 300G, then move north onto the
water where several foes will attack. Head north (DO NOT go south! You'll
fall off the waterfall and will need to climb a bit to get back here!), get
the chest for a MID-POTION, then move left onto dry land where there's a
Freelancer. Get the chest on the left for a MID-ETHER, then go down the
ladder and head left off the screen.

Fight the enemies you come across in this suspiciously open area, then 
cross the bridge. Head left and to the next screen. Use a Shelter at the
save point, save, then head down the ladder on the left. Grab another MID-
ETHER from a chest on the right, go down another ladder to the south, and
off the screen to the right. Head south, down the broken ladder, grab a
SHELTER from the chest, and fight the Ogans. Head up the ladder on the 
right. If the Freelancer knocks you off, you can fight it, or climb the
ladder again and Crono will take 5 HP damage. Head into the cave at the
north end.

Head to the north end to find the legendary Masamune. Confirm the child 
that you're taking it and, well, boss fight.

Recommended Levels-15+
----------------------------
The first part of the fight is insanely easy, so don't waste a ton of MP
getting through it. All you need to do is drain one of their HP's to 0. 
Not both of them. Masa and Mune are individually insanely weak, with only
a few magic Techs draining their health. They'll counterattack with 
X-Strike every time you hit one of them, but it only does a pitiful 35 or 
so damage by now. As you could probably guess the battle won't be this 
easy.

They'll merge into the bizarre looking Masa & Mune. The giant creature has
a lot more health, so taking it down will be tougher. Stick with your magic
Techs as usual as they'll cause a lot more damage than non-magic attacks.
The fight isn't particuarily hard--Masa & Mune's attacks mainly hit only
one of your characters, but beware when you get the notice it's storing
whirlwind energy. Heal up your party before they use Vacuum Wave. This
attack does around 120 damage to your entire party. Very, very bad. Heal
up right away.

Masa & Mune's other attacks only do about 50 damage to one character, as
mentioned. You can work-around this as Marle or Robo can easily heal up 
that damage, and Mid-Potions get the job done too. Just heal before and 
after Vacuum Wave and you won't have a terribly hard time with this 
slightly tedious, but simple, boss fight.
===========================================================================
Once the fight is over, walk up to the sword and grab it. You'll obtain the
broken Masamune. Luckily, you'll get blown out of the mountain, saving you
the tedious trip back.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Use a Shelter to heal yourselves, then go south to the oceanside village.
Go inside the Market. In the bottom left corner is a sparkly spot 
containing a STRENGTH CAPSULE. Buy more Mid-Potions to replace the ones you
used up recently, and buy Porrean Berlets for the femals and Golden Suits
for everyone if you've got the cash to spare (and I'm sure you do).

Now head directly south into Tata's House. Talk to the young boy Tata (the
one who fleed Denadoro Mountains) and he will hand you the Hero's Badge. 
Leave his house and head just north of the village then dead left, and 
follow the trail back to the Cursed Woods.

======================
~Cursed Woods; 600 AD~
======================
Head through the linear path and down the ladder behind the bush at the 
end. Talk with Frog to present him the Hero's Badge. The chest he was 
standing infront of will now sparkle, and he grants access to it. You'll
receive the broken hilt of the Masamune. After analyzing it, it seems this
sword is the work of Melchior. Or something. Maybe. But it all leads to
him! I'm sure you remember where he lives, right?

Leave Frog's house and head south out of the forest.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Remember how to get back to Truce Canyon? Head north, across Zenan Bridge,
and directly right. Not terribly hard to get back in a small world map.

Nothing special here. Just run through this place, kill the simple foes,
and enter the Time Gate.

Take the portal just right of the one you arrive in to Medina Village.

====================

====================
Walk out of the house as you've done before. Head directly left to reach
Melchior's Cabin. Enter and talk to him and he'll mention that he's unable
to repair the Masamune. He requires Dreamstone, which hasn't been seen for
a long, long time. Hint hint, nudge nudge.

Our business in this time period is over with. Head back to Medina Village,
into the Residence, and use the Time Gate in the wardrobe to leave.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Take the bottom left portal to Mystic Mountains: 65,000,000 BC. You could
have come to this location earlier, but no plot events would occur until
after your conversation with Melchior. In any case, get inside the portal.

=================================
~Mystic Mountains; 65,000,000 BC~
=================================
Oh, real nice Time Gate. Don't even put us on solid ground. Thanks. Oh,
double thanks for dropping us into an enemy ambush. Real great! The
Reptites you face here are pretty annoying foes, especially in a large
group such as this. Use several hit all Techs, like Crono and Robo's
Supersonic Spin Dual Tech. That should kill them all handily. Lucca's
Napalm is good too for wiping out part of the group.

Once killed, another huge group will come. Luckily, a woman will chase away
the majority of the Reptites, leaving you with just four more to kill. Do
whatever you did in the previous battle and you'll kill them all just as
quickly. Like, Supersonic Spin quickly.

Rename Ayla if you wish when she talks to you. Once the conversation with
her ends, she invites you to Ioka Village. Follow her off the screen to the
right and south. In the next area, just follow the linear path south,
grabbing the BERSERKER RING near the beginning from a chest, fighting all
enemies for more Exp (and especially TP. Crono should learn Lightning II
as soon as possible. It's amazing for this era), and finally leave the area
through the southern exit.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Pangaea! And to think this all becomes a civilization one day. Head right
and you will see two huts south of the river. Head inside the right hut and
talk to the woman on the left. Drink happy water (guess what's in it?) to
restore all HP and MP. Head across the river. Go inside the Chief's Hut on
the left to find Ayla.

Talk with her and she will invite you to the party that's about to
commence.

================================
~Meeting Grounds; 65,000,000 BC~
================================
Party! And the music! So nice! You'll have control over just Crono now.
Talk with Ayla, then talk to both of your partners. The right partner,
being Marle or Lucca, will get up to go talk/dance or make a drink
respectively. Talk with the roaming female again while their dancing/
finished making the drink, and then you should be able to trigger a new
conversation with Ayla (I'm clueless if that's all it takes to activate it.
If you can't do it, keep talking with your partners until Ayla eventually
says something new).

Now she should mention something about the Reptite tribe and their leader
Azala, and then go right back to telling you to enjoy the party. Talk to
your dancing/drinking female again, agree to whatever they ask of you to
do, talk to the other partner, talk to some of the dancing villagers, then
talk to Ayla once more. She should now ask if you want the shiny red
Dreamstone. Agree to her challenge for the stone.

In this "simple" mini-game, all you must do is drink more than her. To
drink you need to mash the A button. Which turns "simple" controls into
something much more infuriating. If you can't mash it fast enough to beat
her? Nothing I can really say to help. I *think* she drinks slower and
slower each time you fail. May just be my off perception so I don't know.
It's not terribly hard to win--just mash the A button 50 or so times in
about 10 seconds.

Once you finally win the game, the Dreamstone is yours. You'll awake in the
morning, only to find an important item missing. And you kinda need this
item.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
You'll appear in Ayla's hut. Talk to her to wake her up and she agrees to
help you fight the Reptites who obviously stole the item. You'll have to
swap someone in your party out for her. You have to use Ayla for a little
while. I advise keepin Robo in the team for pure power. The trio of Crono/
Ayla/Robo is broken in this game. Lucca's good too if you want her to gain
more Techs. Now leave her hut.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~5M.Footprints! Follow!~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
And now for something completely optional. This is only if you want a few
good items. If you don't, skip to the next World Map segment's --> to
continue with the plot. If you want the goodies, head north of the Meeting
Grounds and right to find a path leading to two locations--one to the
Dactyl Nest plateau, the other to the Huning Range forest. You want the
Hunting Range.

==============================
~Hunting Range; 65,000,000 BC~
==============================
Let me explain--the hut right of Ayla's houses a trader who will allow you
to trade 3 of an item, and 3 of another item, for a powerful weapon/armor.
The items you can use to trade are Feathers, Horns, Fangs, and Petals. All
enemies in this small forest drop some of these items, and Ayla's Charm
move can swipe additional items. It's a great place to farm them.

Also, there's the occasion you will find it raining in the range. This
signifies that a Nu has appeared. The blue beast will be in one of three
specific spots, and you have about 20 seconds to find it before it leaves
and you'll have to wait awhile before another appears. Nu's hand out a ton
of these items (three of each), and give out 30 TP from a battle. So, yeah,
this is good trading item farming AND TP farming. Wonderful!

Head north from the starting point to find, and defeat, a Prehistoric Frog.
>From there, head left and south to find another group of frogs. Once
killed, head north to another fight with frogs, then a bit further north to
find an Ion Cloud. By now it has probably started raining. The trees just
southwest of the Ion Clouds you can walk through to the top left corner of
the Hunting Range. This is one of the spawning spots for the rain-making
Nu's.

>From the Ion Cloud's location, climb the vines to the high ledge. Head
right a little bit, and before the path goes south you can climb down vines
back to the lower ground. Heading right is the top right corner of the
Hunting Range, and another spawning spot for Nu's. South of the vines is an
Ion Cloud.

If you were to go back up the vines and follow the linear path to the
bottom right corner, this is the last spawning point for Nu's. If you
stayed at the Ion Cloud spot, follow the trail right and south, fight one
last group of frogs, and you'll be right back at the starting point.

Attempt to beat a Nu for the TP (a solid 30), as well as the THIRD EYE
accessory for the first one you beat. These guys aren't too deadly. They
rarely attack, and if they do it's with their headbutt that knocks its
target down to 1HP. No worries--he rarely does anything that'll actually
inflict non-set damage.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Head south and into the hut right of Ayla's. Talk to the tribal man in the
middle and agree to trade with him, assuming you've got at least three of
two of the items: Feathers, Horns, Petals, and Fangs. Here's what you can
trade for (note that the order of the items given is irrelevent, i.e. you
can give a Petal then Fang, or Fang then Petal, and you'll still get the
Ruby Gun. Also, you're asked to confirm if that's what you want, so don't
worry about messing up):
Petal + Fang-->Ruby Gun
Petal + Horn-->Shaman's Bow
Petal + Feather-->Stone Arm
Fang + Horn-->Mammoth Tusk
Fang + Feather-->Ruby Vest
Horn + Feather-->Stone Helm

Of these six items, the Ruby Vest is by far the best. It's resistant to
Fire magic damage, and provides good Defense. Get a pair of these. The
Mammoth Tusk is a more powerful sword for Crono than his likely equipped
weapon presently, the Crimson Blade. The other three weapons aren't
terribly special, but useful if you don't want to wait a little later for
better weapons for Lucca/Marle/Robo. The Stone Helm is also good for
additional Defense. Get a pair of these if you can.

-->Well, with new items in tow or not, head south of the river and into the
Forest Maze.

============================
~Forest Maze; 65,000,000 BC~
============================
Head right and talk to Kino. Once he and Ayla finish talking, you have
free access to the maze. This place is a tad complicated to get through,
bearing shadows all over the place, paths behind trees and under arches
hard to see, and so on. Head right through the trees and grab the MID-
POTION in the chest.

Head up and right, then go down the vines and proceed right, down more
vines, then head right around stone structure here and across the wooden
log. Follow the path south to a dead end with a MID-POTION in a chest, then
return all the way north, going left for a MID-ETHER in a chest, and then
following the path right to the top right corner of the maze.

Head south to get into a battle against a Bao Bao. Don't use magic against
these guys as it does little damage. Proceed south, hugging the left side
to get an ATHENIAN WATER from a chest, then going right and south. You'll
get into another fight near the footprints. Head all the way south for a
SHELTER in the chest, then walk right and up onto the high ledges of the
forest.

Proceed north, left, then south until you reach more footprints and another
battle. Kill the foes, then follow the path south and left to a split. If
you keep going north, fighting several battles along the way, you'll head
into a large clearing. Head towards the bottom right corner, under the
pathway, and grab a MID-ETHER from the chest.

Head back to the split, going left this time. Go all the way left to grab
a MID-POTION from a chest, then go north and left to a clearing. Fight one
more set of enemies, go all the way left and in the bottom left corner grab
a PANACEA from the chest. The bottom-middle of the clearing has vines.
Climb down them, then walk south and out of the maze.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Take the time here to heal yourself with a Shelter. When ready, enter the
Reptite Lair.

=============================
~Reptite Lair; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Proceed through the door in the bottom right corner. In this large room you
will find a hole and four enemies. Don't fight any of them. After a bit of
waiting one of the enemies will dig a hole. You can choose which hole you
wish to fall down, but keep in mind you miss out on some goodies depending
on the hole you use. They all end up at the same destination, however.

In some of the rooms you drop into, you can wait and sometimes another blue
foe will dig another hole in addition to the one already present in the
room. Some of these paths have chests containing various items, one of them
holding a sweet Ruby Vest. If you encounter a Megasaur on your way down,
not that these guys won't take much damage until you shock them with a
Lightning Tech. Here are the four holes, and the chests you can grab on
your way down:
Top Hole-->Nothing
Middle Hole-->Mid-Ether, Hi-Potion
Left Hole-->Mid-Ether, Elixir, Ruby Vest
Right Hole-->Hi-Potion, Hi-Ether

Once you reach the bottom room, you'll find a ton of Reptites running
around. Get the chest near the bottom left corner (a Reptite is infront of
it, obstructing easy view of it) for a STONE HELM. Another chest guarded by
a Reptite in the top right corner (where the exit to this room is) to get
a HI-ETHER.

In the next room you'll encounter enemies to the south right away. Head
north after that, kill the foes here, then head left and through the
doorway into another room if you wish. If you head up the ladders, up the
stairs, and down the hole in the room after that, you'll fall back to the
large clearing with the enemies that make holes.

If you keep heading north instead, you will fight Reptites and a Megasaur
guarding the stairs to the next screen. Kill them all off, creating a save
point on the right. Use a Shelter and save, then head up the stairs. Sit
through the conversation and get ready for a boss fight.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Nizbel
HP-4200
Defense-252/Magic Defense-100
Exp-500/TP-10/G-0

Techs:
Charge
Earthquake
Electric Discharge (Light Tech)

Recommended Levels-18+
----------------------------
Nothing you do will hurt him for more than 10 damage until you use
Lightning on him. This will severely reduce his Defense, allowing you to
strike him. Magic Defense also gets lowered. At this point all you honestly
need to do is pound the hell out of him.

Use Robo's Robo Tackle and Crono and Ayla's Dual Tech Drill Kick. By this
time he will use Electric Discharge which will do a huge amount of damage
to your party (nearly 200 to everyone). Spend the following turn healing
up, then use Lightning again to lower his Defenses and repeat the process.

Earthquake hits everyone for light damage, while Charge does twice as much
damage to only one character. Overall it's a pathetically easy fight as
Nizbel attacks for about every six attacks you use. Yeah. This isn't very
hard. Just heal up after Electric Discharge and it'll be simple.
===========================================================================

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
With the Gate Key in hand, Ayla will leave your party to stay here in the
era. All you need to do is walk back to the Mystic Mountains.

=================================
~Mystic Mountains; 65,000,000 BC~
=================================
Follow the linear trail north, kill any foes you meet, and move to the next
screen. Head to the top left corner and to th enext screen. Climb the hill
and walk off the cliff at the top, choosing to fall down into the Time
Gate.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Take the portal to Medina Village; 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Leave the house and follow the trail left, back to Melchior's Cabin. Head
inside and talk to him. After he and one of your partners heads downstairs
to assist in reforming the Masamune, follow them. Sit through about a
minute of them dawdling around.

The end result is worth it as the Masamune will be reassembled. Time to
give it to Frog.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             ~5N.The Masamune~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Our affairs are set here. Head back to Medina Village, into the residence,
and through the wardrobe.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Take the top left portal to Truce Canyon.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~
======================
I'm sure you know what to do by now. Get through this simple two screen 
area and out to the...

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head south and left, south across Zenan Bridge and all the way down to the
bottom village. Head northwest of it and follow the trail back to the
Cursed Woods.

======================
~Cursed Woods; 600 AD~
======================
Head straight north through this linear place and down the ladder behind 
the bush at the end to reach Frog's abode once again. Talk to him to hand
over the Masamune. Once the long cutscene and Frog's speech ends, he will
opt to join your party. He's forced into your group for the next part of
the game, so you must choose who to sit out. 

Both Lucca and Robo need to keep climbing their Tech trees, so I advise to
keep switching between the two. Robo should be close to learning Heal Beam,
a useful healing ability. Lucca will likely continue getting stronger and
stronger Fire Techs. Personally, I favor Robo more, but Lucca is good too
(not to mention you should keep leveling her up so she can make a distant
boss fight easier).

Once that's all settled, leave his house and walk south to get out of the
forest.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Time for something optional. It's not so much "optional" so much as 
"really, really desired". Head all the way back to Truce Canyon.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~
======================
You know the drill.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Head into Spekkio's room and Frog will be taught magic. He uses Water type
moves, naturally the weakest in the game. But at least he has magic, so he
will be more than useful in a few upcoming boss fights. Leave back to 600
AD.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~
======================
Yeah.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head back to the area near Denadoro Mountains. However, your destination
now is the mountains southeast of Denadoro. Enter the Magic Cave here.

====================
~Magic Cave; 600 AD~
====================
Sit through another long cutscene and the entrance to the cavern will open.
Head inside. Use magic Techs against the first group of enemies you come
across, then head right and north to another fight. After a few magic Techs
these guys will fall as well. After the fight, chase a group of rats down
south and fight them all off, using the same tactics as before.

Once killed, more enemies will appear. Get some more Exp from these simple
foes. When everything is dead, head up the stairs, examine the dead soldier
by the exit, then leave.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Heal up with a Shelter and save the game. Enter the Fiendlord's Keep once 
you are prepared. Also, be sure to equip the Hero's Badge as Frog's
accessory. It's handy for him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~5O.The Fiendlord's Keep~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
~Fiendlord's Keep; 600 AD~
==========================
Shnazzy tower. Head through the front gate. Go up the red stairs, head left
and up the stairs here. Ignore the creepy people and get the chest in the
top right corner for a MID-ETHER, then head all the way to the north end of
the room. Ignore more people, walk to the end of the next room, and grab
the MID-ETHER and SHELTER from the chests.

With this all done, head back to the entrance room. This time head right
and up the stairs there. Head around the kids surrounding the treasure
chest and up the stairs to the next room. You'll find more people in the
next room. Grab a MID-ETHER from the chest near Queen Leene, then keep
trudging north. Once you see an empty chair in the next room, head back
south to the entrance room.

A save point will have appeared at the stairs here. Enter it to trigger
Ozzie's appearance. Once he's done taunting Frog you'll have to battle a
group of six foes. A simple hit-all move like Supersonic Spin will kill all
of them with ease. Now you'll need to go through the left and right
staircases again, back to those dead ends you may have been confused at
earlier. Doesn't matter which order you do the pair in.

Let's head right first. Talk to the kids and answer that you want their
treasure. You'll fight four Shadows. Use your magic Techs to off them and
allow access to the BARRIER SPHERE in the chest. These things reduce magic
damage by 1/3rd in battle when used. Very useful for the big boss fight at
the end of the Keep (guess who it could possibly be?).

Head north to the next room. Don't bump into Lucca/Taban, Leene, or Crono's
mom unless you want to fight some enemies. Before heading up the stairs,
heal your HP and MP. Once prepared, head upstairs. Talk to the odd looking
creature now occupying this once empty room to battle one of Ozzie's
comrades, Flea.

Wind Waltz (Confuse)
Rainbow Storm (Poison)
Rainbow Beam (Blind)

Recommended Levels-19+
----------------------------
Really annoying fight. Against Flea?, hit it with any attack from any party
member. Whichever character strikes Flea? will lose all their MP from the
MP Buster counter. You should make it Crono since he attacks first, and
when the next fight commences he can heal MP right away.

As you may expect, the real Flea will appear now (and yes, the bat that was
following you around was Flea). She (he?) has all status inflicting
attacks, all of which are incredible annoying. Be sure to have Panaceas on
hand to heal the bad effects like Sleep and Confuse.

All of Flea's attacks do moderate damage. Hence why this isn't a terribly
hard fight. Despite low Magic Defense, magic Techs do about half as much
damage as physical attacks. Thusly, ignore magic based Techs. You'll need
to heal often throughout the fight because she constantly attacks, and the
damage builds up quickly. Don't forget that Robo and Frog have healing
moves too (so does Marle, but she sucks for combat). If you have trouble,
get Robo to learn the Heal Beam Tech, which heals the entire party a bit.
It's really useful if you have it.

And be wary of her occasional The Look counter. It'll deal about 100 damage
to everyone, so be sure to keep everyone above 100 HP at all times to avoid
potential knockouts from the move.
===========================================================================
Once this damned fight is over, leave the room and head south back to the
entrance hall. I advise stepping onto the World Map and using a Shelter.
Once you're healed up (and you better save as well), head up the left
stairs. A bunch of enemies are running around in circles, but if you hug
the walls none of them will be a concern. Head for the room in the far
north again. This time at the dead end talk to the woman at the north end.

All of the people here will fight you. All of them are insanely weak. Once
all dispatched, the second of Ozzie's henchman, Slash, will taunt you.
Battle time!

Recommended Levels-20+
----------------------------
Unarmed Slash has a few attacks, all of which deal around 70 damage to a
single member of the party, except for Firebomb which will strike everyone.
Like the Flea fight, don't waste energy on magic Techs. Physical Techs do
well over twice as much damage as them. This guy isn't too hard due to a
lack of attacks, and he won't attack terribly often.

Of course he'll pull out his sword, making the fight a lot harder. Same
tactics as usual--keep spamming the high powered physical Techs for
maximum damage output. He will still make long pauses between attacks. His
Wind Slash can hit everybody if he attacks from one of the bottom corners
of the room. All of his moves will continue to deal about 70 damage to
your party, except for Cleave (dealing well over 100), but be wary now that
he can strike multiple members at once with ease.

Frenzy does a lot of damage as well, but he doesn't use it very often (save
for common counters when he gets low on HP). You shouldn't need to do as
much healing as in the Flea fight, but continue to never let your HP get
too low due to those strong 100+ damage moves he has.
===========================================================================
Touch the sword Slash drops when he falls to obtain the SLASHER. Equip this
baby on Crono right away. A save point appears where Slash fell. Save and
use a Shelter, then return to the entrance room.

Step on the save point that reappears here to discover it's actually a warp
point. You'll be transported to another area of the castle. You will have
to fight through four groups of enemies. Really good for some TP, which
you will be wanting for the record. Crono would like Lightning II at some
point. Grab the MIST ROBE in the chest at the end, then talk to Ozzie.

Chase the fleeing fatty upstairs. In this room conveyor belts will send you
into large axes moving up and down. Wait until they are up, then run under
them. As you progress through the room Ozzie will increase the speed of the
axes (if they hit you, you take 50 damage so... avoid them). Grab the
DARK MAIL at the midway point, then continue to the end of the room. When
Ozzie flees, grab the DEATH CLAW from the chest near the crane, then chase
him further upstairs.

Follow the linear path upstairs. If you touch one of the Roundillo's, you
will get into a fight. At some points you'll find chain ladders. Head down
them to stay safe from the Roundillos. When they pass, climb back up them
and continue ascending the tower.

At the top you'll be in a seemingly empty room with Ozzie operating another
crane. This room is full of holes that you won't notice until you walk over
them. Hug the left wall and follow it around the room. You will fall into a
room with six Lancers. Kill these easy foes off. There are four "save
points" in this room. Two of them are enemies, one is an actual save point
(I advise healing and saving, naturally), and the last is a warp back to
the hallway you just fell from.

The enemies are always across from each other. Same goes for the save
point/warp. Don't miss the BARRIER SPHERE, SHELTER, LAPIS, and MID-ETHER
from all four chests down here, as well as a MAGIC CAPSULE sparkling a bit
right of the bottom "save point". The psuedo save points give insane Exp 
and TP, so they're worth falling down all the holes to constantly fight 
them.

Back in the previous hallway, follow the wall back to the hole you fell in.
Hug the left edge of the exposed hole and walk north to Ozzie. You'll fall
in another hole. Get out, do the same process, and walk around the hole you
just fell into to to reach Ozzie. Follow him yet again upstairs. You will
have to ascend another part of the tower, this time with Roundillo Bombers
coming down the Donkey Kong-like staircases. Repeat the process of hanging
onto metal chain ladders to evade them.

At the top, you'll need to go through another with a bunch of fights in
them. There's nothing you can really do about that, sadly. You'll get a ton
of Exp and TP from these battles, though, so don't complain! Grab the SPEED
BELT from the chest (Lucca could benefit from it), and follow the green
guy upstairs again. You will get into even more fights here, but all are
avoidable if you walk around the statues instead of between them.

Do as you wish, grab an ATHENIAN WATER from the chest at the end, then head
further upstairs. Get the MIST ROBE and MAGIC SCARF from the chest adjacent
to Ozzie. Looks like he has nowhere else to run. Let's finish him.

the stairway and into the room at the bottom. Rush north to find Magus.

Alright, as you can tell from his insane Defense, magic Techs are going to
be the way to go. However, he will counterattack if you hit him with any
magic attack save one type. He switches his type weakness (you're alerted
to it) every now and then.

However, to get through quickly you'll need to lower his Magic Defense.
Strike him with a normal attack from Frog. The Masamune has to be equipped
for it to work (if for some reason it's not equipped then this isn't going
to happen. Why would you unequip it anyway?).

Use a normal attack and a message appears saying which magic types are
being absorbed. The one that can hurt him will be noted. Hit him with only
that type. Everyone else should stick to physical attacks. He changes
barrier types each time he is hit by an attack. Each time the barrier
changes he will counterattack with the magic attack he is not absorbing
(if he's weak to Light he'll counter with Lightning II, for example).

This makes the fight incredibly annoying as he will constantly be harming
everyone for 100+ damage. Robo should be spamming Heal Beam throughout the
whole battle. You will need to hit him with the Masamune again to lower his
Magic Defense every few attacks. If you need the chance to heal, and you
will want to do so often, simply stop hitting him. He won't use his strong
counterattacks that way.

So, yeah, knowing this the first half of the fight is simply very
repetitive, but nothing too terrible if you can keep everyone healed up.
However, once Magus gets down to about 4000 HP, he will lower his defenses
to begin casting a spell. All magic types hit him, and physical attacks do
good damage. You'll want to focus on getting everyone back to near max HP
before barraging him, though.

All he will do now is cast Dark Matter, the ultimate Shadow Tech. It's
insanely powerful, easily dealing 250+ damage to everyone. Spend a few
moves healing everyone again, then resume smacking Magus around. When Magus
gets into this phase the battle is pretty much won, as the ONLY thing he
uses will be Dark Matter every six or so moves. Just keep yourself healed
and nothing will be a problem.

If you have trouble with the first stage of the fight, don't forget you
have Barrier Spheres in your inventory. They're only temporary, but the
extra resistance against Magus's strong magic attacks could help you if you
are underleveled.

Keep go boom.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Best not to ask how we ended up in Ayla's hut. Your HP and MP will be
restored after the sleep. Head outside after this is over.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~5P.Forward to the Past~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Head north of Ayla's tent and to the partially burned down forest. There
is a lone hut in the middle of it. Enter Laruba Ruins.

=============================
~Laruba Ruins; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Head north, talking to the Laruba if you wish. At the north end you will
find Ayla talking with the Laruba Elder. If it isn't made obvious by the
conversation, you'll want to tail Ayla to the Dactyl Nest. 

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Head just right of the forest, then north to the Dactyl Nest plateau. It's
right next to Hunting Range if you remember going there some time ago.

============================
~Dactyl Nest; 65,000,000 BC~
============================
Walk north and fight the group of enemies. They should all be easy to kill
by now, I'm sure. I advise killing every single enemy in the Nest. Crono
should be VERY close to learning Lightning II by now, easily one of his 
most useful moves. Try to get enough TP to learn it.

Anyway, proceed north after the fight. Get into a fight with some Avian
Rexes, then proceed up the rocks on the wall that form a ladder of sorts.
Grab a MID-ETHER from the chest at the top, then head left and south. Fight
the trio of Schists, then follow the path right and north. Climb another
rock-ladder and walk right off the screen.

Fight another trio of enemies that are blocking the rock-ladder. Once 
killed, climb the rocks and follow the path north. Climb more rocks and 
head left and south. Kill more Schists, grab a MESOZOIC MAIL (save it for
when you get Ayla back in your party), climb another ladder, then head 
north for a forced fight with Avian Rexes. Climb one last ladder to get off
the screen. 

You'll witness Ayla up ahead. Run up to talk to her and she will rejoin
your party for good. She's forced for now, so you'll need to ditch someone
again. Let it be Frog. He's so weak. And his magic attacks honestly suck,
much like Marle's. Stick with Robo/Lucca as your third member.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
You never need to walk again in Prehistory. You can ride the dactyls to any
location you feel like on the map. Just press A to land (you need to be
hovering over passable terrain, obviously). Fly to the center of the
pangea-like continent. It's the area will of lava. You should see a tall
plateau with a castle on it. Land there, heal with a Shelter and save. 
Enter Tyranno Lair when you're ready.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Tyranno Lair; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Head north and fight the pair of Cave Apes and the Reptite. North of them
will be two skull heads. Since the left one is closed, head inside the
right one and down the stairs behind it. Head south, fight more Reptites,
then head right. Defeat even more Reptites, then head down the stairs they
were guarding.

Head south to find a trio of Reptites guarding a cage. Engage in battle
against them. Once they're all dead, then talk to the guy that rushes to
the cage door. Ayla will rescue Kino. After the conversation ends, Kino
will order you to follow him. Grab a MID-ETHER from the egg chest in the
cage, then follow Kino back through the linear path you took to get here.

Back in the entrance room, get out of the skull and Kino will open up the
left skull so you can proceed further in the castle. Head through it and up
the stairs behind it. Head right, step on the switch in the floor to drop
the nearby enemies into a pit, then head outside via the door in the south
wall. Once outside, head right and fight some foes. Then head inside the
right room. There are two egg chests in here. Grab a HI-POTION from the
left one and leave. Opening the right one makes a trap door open, and you
will fall to the first floor and will need to work your way back up here.

Outside, head back to the left room after fighting more enemies. Head
inside the left room, then head left and hit the switch on the floor to
drop more foes into a pit. Head outside. Kill off the trio of Reptites,
then enter the room on the left. This room has dull grey flooring. It's a
maze of sorts as several tiles send you warping around the room. It's not
hard to reach the stairs to the 3rd floor (the top left corner), but you
can get some nice items in the room. A lot of squares in the room also
trigger battles. Be careful.

Head due north, and when you reach a gap move right. You'll be warped to
bottom left side of the room. Move directly right to be warped to the top
right corner of the room. Grab the MESOZOIC MAIL from the chest, then head
two spaces south of the chest and left to get warped near the top-middle of
the room. Grab the POTION from the chest you're close to. Head all the way
right from this chest, then south seven spaces, then right to be warped to
the bottom left corner again. Go north and collect the ATHENIAN WATER from
a chest. Head left against the wall, then north to be warped. Go right a
few spaces, then south to get a TRICERATOPPER from a chest. Equip it on
someone.

That's all the items here. From the Triceratopper chest, head due north to
find the stairs to the 3rd floor. Head south to appear back outside. Your
goal is to reach the door on the far right. Several groups of foes will
block your way, though. When you make it to the room, there are two
switches. Both open the skull, but the left one also makes enemies appear.
Go through the skull and press the switch on the wall. Head back outside.

Head through the door in the middle now after killing the enemies guarding
it. You'll find good ol' Nizbel behind the door. He won't fight you,
luckily. Walk around him (there's enough room to squeeze by) to the walkway
behind him. Finally there's a save point. Use a Shelter and save. Attempt
heading up the stairs.

Just kidding, he's gonna fight you.

Nizbel Charge                    Nasal Gas (Poison)
Electric Discharge (Light Tech)
Earthquake

Recommended Levels-24+
----------------------------
Use Lightning (II) on Nizbel to severely lower his Defense. The trick to
this fight is that every time he is attacked his Defense will increase a
little bit again. Use a Lightning attack for every few attacks your
partners use.

All of his attacks deal around 50 damage. He has the annoying poison-
inducing counter, but it's rarely, rarely used. Electric Discharge is the
biggie. That sucker does nearly 200 damage to your entire party. He uses
this move every three times you use Lightning/II, so try to limit your
usage of those two moves so you don't keep getting hit by this attack.

Past Electric Discharge this fight is just as easy as the previous Nizbel 
fight. He's not terribly challenging. Just has a lot of HP to deplete, but 
Robo's Heal Beam or any other healing moves/items will suffice every few 
turns. Just remember not to spam the Lightning moves to avoid many 
Electric Discharges.
===========================================================================
Save and heal once again after the fight, then head up the stairs for
real. Head south to be outside once again. Go right to fight some foes.
Somewhere around this point Ayla and Crono should learn the Falcon Strike
Dual Tech. It's insanely powerful. It won't happen until Ayla learns her
Boulder Toss Tech.

In any case, enter the room on the far right. Three switches are in this
room. Hit the north-middle switch to make a save point appear. Ignore the
other two switches as they just make pits appear (if you hit the left
switch then you can't use the save point). Examine the skull to make it
open, press the switch on the wall behind it, and grab the HI-ETHER from a
chest next to this switch.

Walk back outside. Fight through enemies to reach the door in the middle.
Last chance to heal before going inside. I advise equipping any Ruby Vests
you still have. Once you do, listen to Azala taunt you, then follow her
outside. At the end of the balcony you'll get into a fight. Surprise
surprise.

Black Tyranno Techs:

Recommended Levels-25+
----------------------------
Not a terribly hard fight. You will want to off Azala as quickly as
possible to make the fight a lot simpler. Use only magic Techs on Azala as
your physical moves won't dent her very much. Simply ignore the Black
Tyranno until Azala is defeated. Both of them will attack occasionally,
everything dealing around 60 damage to your characters. Black Tyranno will
use fire-based attacks, so those Ruby Vests will come in handy.

Once Azala is defeated, don't do anything. Heal until you receive the
message "Lowering Defense and begins storing power.". Once that appears, go
all out on Black Tyranno. The boss will never attack you at this point, but
make sure everyone has 350+ HP anyway. Black Tyranno will count down
from 5 to 0. Once it hits 0, it'll unleash Tyranno Flame which harms
everyone for well over 300 HP. It's insane.

After the attack, heal and wait for the message again, then continue
spamming high powered physical Techs. Falcon Strike is a good choice here.
Ayla and Crono should have learned it if you didn't run from many fights.
At average levels, you should be able to kill the BT in the middle of the
third countdown.
===========================================================================
Dun dunnnnnnnn! *drum roll* Dun dunnnnnnn!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Head right in this crazy blizzard. You will soon come across a strange
dome, sorta like the ones in 2300 AD. Enter it.

===============================
~Skyway/Land Bridge; 12,000 BC~
===============================
Step onto the glowing tile to get teleported into the sky. Nifty. Head
south and exit the room.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Oh god this is such awesome music. Head right and into Enhasa.

===================
~Enhasa, 12,000 BC~
===================
Feel free to talk to everyone in the building to learn more about the Zeal
Kingdom. Make your way to the top left corner of the room, noticing a young
boy who will mention something happening to one of your party members.
Something bad. Awesome...?

Step on the blue tile nearby and everyone will get fully healed. Now head
south of the tile and to a merchant behind the counter. This marks the
first shop in the game to sell Ethers, so I advise buying a few from the
road if your supply from chests has gone low. A few Shelters and Hi-Potions
will also do well.

Now, there are three openable books in this room. Each reveals an element
when opened. Open the one in the top right corner to reveal water. Open the
one in the top left next to reveal wind. Finally, open the one near the 
entrance to reveal fire. This lowers a bookcase nearby. Enter the exposed
room and talk to the Nu. Choose to accept his challenge to fight a group of
six of them. A single hit all Tech should be able to wipe out the group.
You'll earn a Magic Capsule and Speed Capsule for winning. Leave now.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Head north and go to the Land Bridge.

===============================
~Skyway/Land Bridge; 12,000 BC~
===============================
Step on the tile like you did before, this time riding it down back to the
ground. Exit the dome.

======================
Follow the linear path north and left to another Skyway.

===============================
~Skyway/Land Bridge; 12,000 BC~
===============================
Once again head on the tile and leave to the south.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
In the last area of the Zeal Kingdom, head left. You can view the docked
Blackbird if you wish, but nothing will come out of it save a bit of
wasted time. Enter Kajar next door, though.

==================
~Kajar; 12,000 BC~
==================
Once again, talk to everyone if you want. It's neat information. There are
two rooms in the north area. The left has people with more information. The
right one also has people, but keep examining the ground in the bottom
right corner of the room. Against the southern wall is a SPEED CAPSULE
whose sparkle can't be seen. Good to get it. Robo could use this.

If you want a hint on getting a secret item in the main area of Kajar, talk
to the Nu in the top left corner. In any case, return to the previous room.
You may have seen various books that you could examine and a magic spell
would pop out. Open the one in the top left corner to make water appear.
Now head to the bottom right corner and open up wind. Finally, head to a
counter with a Nu standing behind it in the center of the room and open up
the fire book. This makes the bookcase nearby lower.

Enter the exposed room and grab the object on the tile. You'll receive the
BLACK GEMSTONE. This item is useless now, but you will be able to use it
much later. With that, leave this palace.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Now head right and into the Small Cave. Enter the pillar of light inside
to be raised to a higher area of the map. Once outside, enter another cave
to the right and repeat the process. At the top, enter the Zeal Palace.

========================
~Zeal Palace; 12,000 BC~
========================
Eerie music. Once again, talk to everybody to understand the palace a bit
more. Once you've done that, head to the north end of the room. There are
three rooms--one in the top left, one in the middle, and the last in the
top right. Head to the top left room, talk to the Nu infront of the door to
make him move, then head inside. In the room down the hallway you'll find
the Mammon Machine. Talk to some people to learn about it.

Once you're done observing this beast, head back to the main area, this
time entering the room in the top right corner. You'll see two rooms ahead
of you. Take the right one. Once the conversation ends and Schala leaves,
talk to Janus if you wish and leave the room. Back in the main room, head
into the top middle door.

You'll notice a crested door at the end which Schala goes through. You
can't progress any further here. Leave the hallway and take the top left
door again back to the Mammon Machine. Examine the red button in front of
the Mammon Machine and the screen will glow red. Now head back to the top
middle room and examine the crested door. The Mammon Machine powered up
Marle's Pendant, allowing these doors to open. Head inside.

Oh, that's fun. This Queen sucks.

Recommended Levels-26+
----------------------------
The easiest way to finish the battle is to get killed. It IS possible to
win, it's just really hard. The Golem copies your attacks, essentially.
A thing to note is that several of its copied attacks are really weak. Both
Water II and Ice are insanely weak. If you use just those moves and keep
healing, it's not too bad a fight. Using magic Dual Techs, like Thunder
Chomp, work too. The order of damage his attacks inflict are as follows:
Physical > Shadow > Light > Fire > Water/Ice
Try to avoid hitting him with any physical moves. His Physical Copy attack
deals 400+ damage to a single party member.

Golem spams Iron Sphere, reducing the HP of whoever it hits in half. And it
really spams this. A lot. Hence why you'll probably lose. A good thing to
note is that Lucca's Hypnowave actually works on this boss. Use that to get
a few free attacks in, then put it back to sleep. Spam until victory. The
reward is quite nice, but the outcome is the same regardless.
===========================================================================
Schala's nice. And just like that you're out of here. For all eternity...

Nah I'm just kidding. Too bad some of you couldn't see the sarcasm there.

Walk south to where the dactyl is resting. Hop on and fly left back
towards Mystic Mountains.

=================================
~Mystic Mountains; 65,000,000 BC~

Nothing new here. Proceed north through several groups of enemies, head

In case you already forgot, you're heading for Proto Dome, 2300 AD.

=====================
~Proto Dome; 2300 AD~
=====================
Head south, follow the metal gratings on the right, then keep heading south
to get out of the dome.

~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Proceed north and left, into Site 32.

==================
~Site 32; 2300 AD~
==================
Either win the jetbike race or manually walk to the left end of Site 32.
Once you complete either journey, head south to leave.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Now, you have a few options. If you simply want to continue the story and
don't care about some extra goodies, head south into the Abandoned Sewers.
If you do want the goodies, heed the next few paragraphs. If you're
ignoring them, skip down to the Abandoned Sewers a few paragraphs down.

For now, head left and south into the Arris Dome.

=====================
~Arris Dome; 2300 AD~
=====================
Follow the relatively linear path to the top left corner of the room.
Restock on supplies if you missed on your several oppotunites in the Zeal
Kingdom at the shop, then head down the ladder below Joan. Head through the
door on the right (hold L and R, then press A at the sparkling console if
the path to the door isn't open still).

Proceed north along the metal gratings on the left. Get off of them at the
end, head south along the bug infested pathway, then left on more metal
gratings to reach the door at the end. In the next room, head north onto
metal gratings and follow it around the corner. Then keep going north,
ignore the gratings on the left and pathway on the right (just keep going
north), then head right at the very end. You'll come to a sparkly console.
Hold L and R and press A to open up passage to the sealed door. The pendant
will open it, so you can head inside.

Four chests, containing a LUMINOUS ROBE, ELIXIR, ACUITY RING, and a GOLDEN
EARRING are here. Pick up the sparkling STRENGTH CAPSULE in the center of
the room. Back in the previous room, head right along the metal gratings,
then south onto some more, and loop around back to the beginning of the
room.

Back in the room with several bugs, head through the linear pathway. Once
you reach the end, head up the ladder in the bottom right corner to be back
at Joan. Leave the dome entirely now.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head left to Site 16.

==================
~Site 16; 2300 AD~
==================
Walk close to the Mutant to avoid fighting it, then proceed south and left.
Stand far from this next Mutant to avoid a fight, then head north, kill
the Shadows with magic attacks if needed, then head left to the next
screen. The winding pathway through this area remains linear, so you should
have no trouble just looking at your map and avoiding the sparingly few
foes here. Remember that the rats swipe a Potion if you touch them, and
500G if you have no Potions. The exit is in the bottom left corner.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head south a little bit to the Bangor Dome.

======================
~Bangor Dome; 2300 AD~
======================
Head to the sealed door in the room and open it. Grab the ALLURING TOP,
HI-ETHER, and WORKMAN'S WALLET from the trio of chests. That's all for
here. I also advise taking the Time Gate here and then warping right back
to Bangor Dome. Having the portal in The End of Time unlocked to here and
Guardia Forest 1000 AD will help in future item collection.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head south to the Trann Dome.

=====================
~Trann Dome; 2300 AD~
=====================
One last pendant door at the end. Open it and grab the GOLDEN STUD and a
HI-ETHER, as well as a MAGIC CAPSULE from the sparkly spot on the floor
left of the chests. With all of our stuff, leave the dome.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
The Golden Stud you just obtained cuts the MP cost of all moves of the
wearer by 75%. I like giving it to Crono for now because he can spam
Lightning II (now at a whopping 2 MP!) constantly. Really nice stuff. Of
course, anybody can make good use of this item. It's the only one in the
game (only way to get more is from the Arena or a New Game +) so treasure
it. Leave for Site 16.

==================
~Site 16; 2300 AD~
==================
You should be able to make it through here without any difficulty once
again. It's really linear, after all.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head right and into the Abandoned Sewers.

===========================
~Abandoned Sewers; 2300 AD~
===========================
Alright, if you did this place when you first visited 2300 AD, then you can
head directly to the exit of this place. If you skipped over the sewers,
you'll have to do the place now. I described earlier in this guide how to
get through it. Ctrl+F "Abandoned Sewers" from the top of the guide and the
second result will be my coverage of the area. Use it if you have yet to go
through this place.

For those who finished the sewers, head left across the bridge, south a
bit, right across another bridge, all the way south and then right and
follow the path until a bridge goes north to a ladder. Follow it and go up
the ladder.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~

Head south, ignore Death Peak, and enter the lonely Keeper's Dome.

Follow the pathway under the metal gratings to a room at the end. Open the
sealed door to enter. You'll now see a bunch of sparkly spots on the floor.
Sadly these aren't awesome items, but rather pieces of memory leftover by
somebody. They'll all make sense in a little bit. They piece together the
story of Lavos for the most part (finally!), the last bit implying you're
about to receive something awesome.

Open the sealed door at the end. Walk around to the back of the machine
that you find in here to trigger a conversation with your party. Now
attempt to leave the room. A Nu will stop you. You can now rename the Epoch
if you wish. Examine the wooden plank that the Nu dropped infront of the
Epoch to be lifted into it.

Once aboard, choose to take off. Your destination is obvious--12,000 BC.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
The Skyway has been sealed, so don't waste your time trying that. Instead
head left to the small cave at the tip of the continent.

=======================
~Terra Cave; 12,000 BC~
=======================
Head up the ladder and through to the room on the left. This is the small
underground village of Algetty. Neat little place. Head inside the first
room a little to the left. The man in here hosts a shop. He's got new
weapons for every character, as well as helms and armor for the males and
females. Problem is that this stuff is insanely expensive. You definitely
won't be able to afford everything. Just buy stuff for the main team
you're currently using. 2 weapons at most, 2 helms and 2 armors. You
shouldn't waste all of your cash here.

Once you're stocked, head down the next ladder. Head inside the room here
if you want details on Janus and the Queen, then keep going down another
ladder, then another. The room here is an inn. Rest up if you need to, then
proceed down one final ladder. Save at the save point, then move right and
into another area of the cave. I HIGHLY advise putting Frog and Lucca into
your team. Magic will be insanely useful in the next area.

=========================
~Mudbeast Den; 12,000 BC~
=========================
Check the bottom right corner's sparkly spot for a STRENGTH CAPSULE, then
head north. You'll be attacked by two Mudbeasts. Magic attacks are powerful
against them, hence why I advised that party. Be careful, as each time they
are attacked their Attack increases. Kill them both off quickly.

Head further north for another fight with two Mudbeasts. Heal up everyone's
HP, then head north a little bit more. Time for a boss fight.

Recommended Levels-27+
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. Like I said before, Lucca and Frog are the
advised partners. Their magic Techs will help greatly in this fight.
Despite what he does, ignore the Mud Imp. He has crazy high Defense and
Magic Defense, and taking him down while both Mudbeasts are alive is quite
challenging.

Playing their weaknesses is key. Frog and Lucca, when they attack the Red
and Blue Mudbeast respectively, can score about 500+ damage with a strong
magic Tech. Crono should heal anyone who takes too much damage, and stick
to single target Techs. Otherwise they will use the powerful Cross Charge
or Earthquake counter, and those are quite powerful.

The Mud Imp likes to spam his healing move. It heals everyone about 150 HP,
which isn't too much for the beasts but a ton for the Imp considering his
high defenses. Save him for last, then swamp him with everything you have
when the Mudbeasts fall. He won't last too long when he can't hop on
anything to charge over you. Physical attacks are far superior than magic
attacks against him. He also loves spamming his heal move after every
attack, so keep using physical Techs and he'll be down fast.

You will likely need to use a ton of healing items through the fight, but
just be patient. It'll take a lot of magic attacks to take everything down.
===========================================================================
You may want to go back to a save point and heal. Once you have, walk up
the chain behind where the Mud Imp was guarding to reach Mt. Woe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~5T.The Guru of Woe~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================
~Mountain of Woe; 12,000 BC~
============================
I HIGHLY advise making a team of Crono, Robo, and Ayla. If you don't have 
their Triple Tech yet, you'll be wanting it. And I ensure you will get it 
within a few fights on Mt. Woe. And for the record, this place is an 
absolute gold mine of Exp.

When you enter, you should notice a brown rock on the right. This foe is a
Rubble. It uses the Omnilock move at the start of the fight, preventing you
from using Items or Techs. All you can do is spam the Attack option. Also,
you have a high likelihood of missing the foe. However, you get a whopping
100 TP and 1000 Exp from killing it. There's about a dozen of these guys
scattered around Mt. Woe. Hence how you can climb the Tech trees of your
characters VERY fast. Note that they do not respawn if you leave the
mountain, and they will run away if you take too long to kill. It should
only take two attacks, maybe three, to kill them.

Moving on. If you want an item, follow the right path from the start. Get
past a forced fight, then cross the chain leading left at the end. Fight 
the Rubble, proceed south, left under the pathway, and reach a chest 
containing a PLATINUM HELM. Walk right and around back to where you 
started. Head left now, across the chain, north to a forced fight, then a 
bit further north and up a chain to the next screen.

From where you arrive, head left for a Rubble fight, then right and north
to a forced fight. A but further north is a save point. Save and heal up,
then proceed north. You'll get into a forced fight at the clearing. Kill
off the easy foes, then walk up the chain on the right. Open the pair of
chests for a PLATINUM VEST and a SHIELD SPHERE, then kill the Rubble
perched here.
Note:My friend informs me that the Rubble here respawns if you leave the
screen and return. I'm unable to confirm if this is true, but if it is than
this is an insanely easy Exp/TP grinding spot.

Walk back down the chain and continue left. You'll get into a fight near a
chest. Open it for a BARRIER SPHERE, then head back right a little bit. You
passed an opening on the cliff wall you can use as a ramp to a higher area.
Once on the second tier of the cliff, head left then south. At the bottom,
walk onto the top tier of the cliff. In the open clearing will be an
obvious fight as you approach the chest in the north. Open it for a LAPIS,
then head right and across a chain to another fight.

Once they're killed, head right and south. You'll get into another battle.
Once you've finished them off, then head down the chain to the south. Head
the southernmost point after getting down the chain to find a Rubble. After
reaping the rewards, head right from the base of the chain, fight more foes
and get a BARRIER SPHERE from the chest. Then head right across another
chain to a new screen.

Go north and get a LAPIS from the chest, then head right. Ignore the
enemies waiting in the clearing and walk across a chain on the right. Head
south, fight more Gargoyles, and grab a chest with a HI-ETHER inside. Head
to the north end to find a BARRIER SPHERE in a chest, then go back across
the chain to the clearing with foes you ignored. Head for the large chain
at the north end. Naturally, you'll fight the Death Lilies beforehand. They
love confusing you, so be careful.

Head up the chain and follow the simple path north. Head left a bit, kill
a Rubble, then head south a few steps until you spot the opening on the
right leading to a higher spot up the cliff. Head south, fight some foes,
and grab a SHELTER and a SHIELD SPHERE from the chests. Now head all the
way north, right across a chain, and up the short cliff to a save point
after killing some more foes. Use a Shelter here, then head up the large
chain.

Follow the simple path up the cliff and get a TIME HAT from the chest. Head
right across the chain, grab the Hi-Ether from the nearby chest, then head
further right. The bottom right corner has a sparkly spot holding a MAGIC
CAPSULE. Now head north and up the final chain to reach the summit.
Finally. Examine the blue crystal to, well, you knew it was coming. Make
sure Ayla is in your party, and if your team fo Crono/Ayla/Robo learned
the Twister Triple Tech...

Recommended Levels-29+
----------------------------
An incredibly easy fight. Of course some of you can't figure out the whole
"if something besides the main boss is on the screen kill them damn things
first" concept in Chrono Trigger (hell, 90% of RPG's in general), hence why
you probably got killed by this thing real fast.

Kill the damn Arms first. It's really easy. Two, possibly three, Falcon
Strikes (Ayla and Crono's Dual Tech) destroy those things. Two Twisters
(Crono/Ayla/Robo's Triple Tech) rape them AND Giga Gaia at the same time
for 1700+ damage.

Oh...fine. Some of you like a challenge. Some of you didn't kill all of the
Rubbles (what the hell is wrong with you?). In this case, note that the
Attack Arm is far more lethal than the Defense one. At a wimpy 2000 HP, you
can wipe that out with a few strong physical attacks.

With the painful arm out of the way, focus your attention to the Defense
Arm. Its attacks are very weak, hence why you'd want to kill it second
rather than first. It'll fall just as quickly as the Attack Arm. When both
arms are down you can freely attack Giga Gaia's head without worry of any
counterattack. He can't attack without his hands, so pummel away. Have one
of your partners heal the several hundred HP damage the hands dealt to
your party. Robo's Heal Beam is good for this task.

After a few attacks Giga Gaia will regenerate his hands and you'll need to
repeat the simple process of destroying them. Repeat until the head lives
no more. I believe that when the Arms are respawned they have less HP than
initially started with (around 1500 HP or so. Not entirely sure). It makes
things a bit easier.

Sit through the long conversation. With access to the Zeal Kingdom opened
once more, the Ocean Palace becomes our next to destination. Talk to

Alright, you know how to get back to the Zeal Palace. It's just so linear.
I think you can handle it. Head to the Skyway, head up, go to the Land
Bridge in the sky and ride it down, then head up and left to another Skyway
to be in the main area of Zeal, then take the light beams in both Small
Caves up to reach the Zeal Palace once more.

This battle is a joke. He counters with Iron Sphere after every single

=========================
~Ocean Palace; 12,000 BC~
=========================
Head south into the next room. This area is massive, and I'll refer to this
as the "main room" until we complete everything in the room. There are a
ton of Scouters in this room of various colors. They can only be hurt by
physical moves and magic Techs matching their color (yellow for Light, red
for Fire, blue for Water). They're everywhere in the Ocean Palace. Stay
alert.

At the first group of enemies you come across, a chest at the base of a
pillar on the right holds a RUNE BLADE. Head south some more, and to the
right of the next group of enemies is another chest holding an AEONIAN
SUIT. You can see the entrance to another room at the center-bottom south
area of the main room. However, lava is blocking it.

To gain access to the next area of the palace, enter the room in the top
right corner. There will be a big blue switch in the middle of the next
room. Press it and two foes will attack (you HAVE to press this switch, it
is crucial to opening passage to the next area of the palace). A Djinn and
Ghul will attack. You need to kill the Ghul first in order to do any
significant damage to Djinn.

Don't go back to the main room. Proceed into the bottom right room instead.
Fight the Red Scouters and Zealot Mage, grab the chest for an AEONIAN HELM,
then head left and back to the main room. This time enter the room in the
bottom right corner. Dodge the two Blue Scouters here if you want, then
proceed south. Grab the chest on the left for a KAISER ARM (amazing for
Robo), the walk across the platform over the lava onto another platform
with tons of foes waiting (this platform appeared from pressing the blue
switch a bit earlier, see?).

If you don't want to fight, walk around the pillars the Scouters are
perched on instead of walking ontop of the blue diamond flooring.
Regardless of your choice, head onto the pathway to the left and press
another blue switch. Head left even more to where enemies are also waiting.
Avoid them if you wish, but be sure to grab the SONIC BOW from the chest in
the bottom right corner.

This area is a dead end, so return to the main room. The blue switch made a
block appear over the lava allowing access to the next area of the palace
through the middle-south exit. However, we should get a few more items
first. Enter the top left room. Step on the blue switch to fight a Ghul and
Djinn. Once killed, enter the room through the bottom left exit.

Fight the Blue Scouters and Zealot Mage in here, then grab the EMPYREAN
BLADE from the chest. Really good on Crono. Use the exit on the right to
reach the main room again. Now enter the room in the bottom left corner.
Fight the Red Scouters and mage in here if you want, grab a SHOCKWAVE from
the chest (gun for Lucca), then head south.

Instead of going onto the area with enemies, follow the border of the room
to the left. Follow until you see a chest surrounded by walls. When the
wall is on your right, hold right to slowly walk up the curved wall. You
will find you can walk through a part of it. Then walk south, then right
through the invisible passage to reach the chest with a DEMONSLAYER inside.
Walk back to the room border and follow it back left, returning all the way
to the main room.

Our business is finished here. Proceed down the center-south exit to the
next area (I advise saving and healing back at the save point at the start
of the palace beforehand). Fight the group of enemies as soon as you enter
the new room, then head left and down the stairs. At the clearing at the
bottom you'll need to kill a group of enemies. Head south and down another
flight of stairs. Every foe you touch you'll have to fight in the next
clearing once you get down these stairs. Carefully weave under them when
they jump into the air.

Kill any Monks you touched in the next clearing, then head down the third
staircase. You can dodge the enemies in this clearing to avoid a fight, but
if you stand still the statues shoot at you, each fireball dealing 50
damage to Crono. Act fast. Battle or not, proceed down a fourth staircase.
Fight a group of Monks, then proceed down one last staircase.

Fight a Ghul and Djinn at the bottom, save and heal, and head south to the
next room. A large group of foes will attack you. Destroy them all, then
examine the sparkly object on the left to make the elevator move down. You
will have to fight three groups of enemies. Falcon Strike will be of
immense use here. Strong magic Techs will also work well. Hit-all attacks
are insanely useful, just don't use a hit-all magic Tech against the group
of six Scouters. All of the counterattacks will likely kill your team.

At the bottom, head to the next room. Ignore the blue switch and follow the
path right to the next room. Kill the trio of Scouters in this room, then
examine the switch they were guarding to flip it. Leave the room, then head
back to the blue switch. Ignore it again and follow the path left to
another room. Repeat the process of killing the Scouters and flipping the
switch, then finally return and hit the blue switch.

A passageway will form. Follow it to the next room. Use a Shelter and save
at the save point. Make a team of Crono and the magic users of your choice.
Lucca is HIGHLY advised. The battle in the next room is considered one of
the hardest in the game for many people.

For the record, this is simply a fight between you and a pair of Golems. If
you thought getting murdered by just ONE was bad, now you have two to
contend with. Considering you should be like six levels higher, it should
be easier, yes?

Remember how the Golem raped you? Really hard? Bet that felt good. There
are many techniques to taking these things down. Lucca's Hypnowave Tech is
usable against these bosses. That's right, you can actually put them to
sleep, rendering them harmless. Of course you'll have to make Lucca
constantly use Hypnowave as they wake up quickly, but it really lessens the
amount of attacks you face.

NEVER use physical attacks against them. Their physical counters do about
350 damage at this point. That's far too much. Their Water magic counter is
the weakest, so Frog or Marle can dish out damage while the rest of your
party is barely harmed by their counters.

Alternatively, the best method is a barrage of hit-all magic Techs. A good
method would be Lightning II, Fire II, Water/Ice II. This makes both
Golems have Water counterattacks once you finish attacking. For this
barrage to work, have everyone's ATB full and then have your party attack
in that order. It's by far the best method to use, with healing necessary
now and again.

If Robo is on the team, have him primarily use Heal Beam to keep everyone's
HP high. Ayla is the worst character to use in this fight, as all she has
is physical moves. Not good against these guys. They also pretty much never
use Iron Sphere if you only use magic Techs.

So, in summary, hit them with two or three magic Techs in a row with all
your characters, ensuring a hit-all Water or Fire move is last. Keep
healing whenever it is required. If you follow that victory is insanely
easy.
===========================================================================
Don't worry about healing. Follow Dalton into the next room. Talk to the Nu
to make him leap out of the way. Proceed north to the Mammon Machine.

With the era reduced to two measly islands, there's not much to do. You
will need to replace Crono now with a third partner. PUT AYLA IN SOMEWHERE.
It doesn't matter where, just put her in! If you don't the next segment of
the game will incredibly annoying. Possible, but very annoying.

There are two tents to the right once you head outside. The top one has a

can't be obtained right now. Head into the forest, into Village Commons.

======================
When your party wakes up, you'll find out everything has been stolen. No
items, money, or equipment. Luckily, we can get it all back. Now, if you
don't have Ayla in your party this will be annoying as you can't fight any
foes until you find the equipment of your lead party member. If you DO have
Ayla in the party, you can go guns a blazing throughout the plane to
recover your stuff.

Head up the ladder to appear outside. Yeah, you're in the air. Neato. Head
back downstairs and you'll be shown where an escape ventilation duct is.
If you want to leave the room, go ahead and do so, then agree to "Pretend
to be sick". This is only viable if you have Ayla in your party since you
can't reach anyone's equipment without her.

Instead, choose to enter the ducts. Head right, up north, left, then north
at your first oppourtunity, then take the second left, then head north at
the end and down a ladder. Open the chest without touching the enemy and
you'll obtain the equipment to your lead character. (Note if you touch
any enemies and none of your characters can fight, you'll be thrown back to
the starting room).

Now that you have weapons, head back up the ladder. Head left, south, then
right to a dead end with a ladder. In the room you drop into, head down
the ladders and kill the Byte, then leave the room at the south end. Head
south and right and enter the door into a small room with three Daltonites
guarding a chest. Kill them off, then open it to recover your money.

Leave the room. Head right and examine the switch next to the bottom
converyor belt to make it switch directions. At the south end of the ship,
head left and enter the room there. Kill the pair of Daltonites and open
the chest to recover the equipment of your 3rd party member. Leave the
room.

Examine the button next to the conveyor belt to switch it again, then head
up it. Head right, then north to find another pair of Daltonites guarding
the entrance to a room. Kill them and enter it. Kill the Byte inside so you
can access the chest with your 2nd party member's equipment inside.

Leave this room, then head left, flip the direction of the belt, then move
north and kill another duo of Daltonites guarding a door. Fight another
pair as soon as you enter the next room. Enter the room on the left to
fight a group of enemies. Grab the chest on the right to recover your
inventory, then exit through the door in the top left. Head up the ladder
infront of you.

You'll be outside again, on the wing. If you missed any chests, you'll be
asked if you wish to continue. Don't worry, you get all your stuff back
after beating a boss in a minute. Fight all of the Turrets on the wing
(they're similar to Rubbles, except they're practically impossible to hit
and give out 1500 Exp), then head to the bottom left corner. Be sure to
have healed up.

You'll fight a Golem Overlord. Um, I'd type out a boss description but in
order to win, just don't attack it. At all. Conserve your MP for now. You
can get 2500 Exp, 40 TP, and 2000 G if you somehow manage to deplete its
massive 15000 HP before it escapes. That's probably not going to happen.

Dalton is still a joke fight. Be careful when attacking, though. He
counters all physical moves with Iron Sphere and all magic Techs with
moves of the opposite type (Use Fire and he will use Water, use Shadow and
he uses Light).

Just avoid physical moves because Iron Sphere drains HP more than anything
else. His HP is still really low, so it should only take a few attacks to
do him in. Robo and Ayla's Double Tech, Beast Toss, nearly one hit KO's
Dalton. Use it if you have it.

after the short scene.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
The Nu shop in the north hut has new goods. All of the weapons that could
have been obtained in the Ocean Palace are for sale (albeit at insane
prices), and Aeonian Helms and Suits are purchasable. Buy what you need,
especially some Mid-Ethers, then wait. If you're lucky, the Nu will leave
the room, allowing you to access the MAGIC CAPSULE sparkling behind him.
It's purely random if he'll leave the room. Enter it, wait 10 seconds, and
if he hasn't moved leave and reenter.

Go to the Village Commons now.

============================
~Village Commons; 12,000 BC~
============================
Talk to the Zeal person wearing blue that's standing near the Elder. He'll
mention someone else washing up at shore.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Head to the top left of the small island.

=======================
~North Cape; 12,000 BC~
=======================
Try picking up the sparkling object at the end of the cape. Magus will
appear, and after the long cutscene you will get the option to fight him
or not. Make sure to NOT fight him. If you seriously want to, he's 
ironically weaker than he was in the Fiendlord's Keep. He doesn't have
Dark Matter anymore, and his HP is the same, so at this point it should 
only take you a few attacks to wipe him out. 

If you don't choose to fight him (and you shouldn't), he will join your
team when you try to leave the cape. Magus knows the "II" form of all magic
types. He's a perfect candidate for the Gold Stud if it wasn't on Crono 
when he died. Regardless of what you choose he says that the Guru of Time 
knows how to revive Crono.

======================
~World Map; 12,000 BC~
======================
Head back to the Epoch and board. While in the air you will notice the
Black Omen rise from the sea. Two vortexes also appear in 600 AD and
65,000,000 BC.

Well, the Epoch can fly now. Now you hardly have to walk anywhere anymore!
Warp to The End of Time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Talk with the old man. He'll tell you that Crono's screwed and gives you a
song to make ya feel better. Head to the portals and he will call for you.
Talk to him again and he will hand you the Chrono Trigger, the item you'll
need to revive Crono. Head to Spekkio, who has likely changed forms since
the last time you faced him. If you can beat him, you'll get some more
nifty items.

Alright, to the Epoch. Travel to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Land and enter Leene Square.

=======================
~Leene Square; 1000 AD~
=======================
You need 40 Silver Points to obtain the Doppel Doll, an item crucial to
reviving Crono. Defeat Gato three times to earn enough points. Once you
have the points, head down to the first area of the fair. On the far right
side is a large circus tent. Enter and talk to the head inside, agreeing to
play his 40 point game for a Doppel Doll.

You need to mimic the Crono clone's actions. L for raising your left arm,
R for right arm, Y for when he laughs, and A for when he acts surprised. If
you mess up once, it's game over. If you mess up, you'll end up paying for
the doll out of your own funds. For every correct move you make the price
will lower, and if you survive about 20 actions (they get pretty fast
towards the end) you'll earn the doll for free. The most you have to pay
for it is 60,000 G. Try not to screw up.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head to Crono's house and to the second floor. Examine the Doppel Doll to
trigger a convo with his mom. After that, examine the doll again to collect
it. Back on the map, head south to Lucca's house and talk to Taban inside
to obtain Taban's Suit, good armor for Lucca. Now, head back to the Epoch
and warp to 2300 AD.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Head towards the middle of the map. You want to land near and enter
Keeper's Dome.

========================
~Keeper's Dome; 2300 AD~
========================
Walk to the north end of the room and open the sealed door. Walk around
the linear room, and in an area close to the Nu you can pick up the sparkly
MAGIC CAPSULE on the ground. Talk to the Nu and he will bring out several
Poyozo Dolls that will aid you on your quest up Death Peak. Depressingly if
you wish, you may go up to him and switch him off forever when he requests
it. With everything done here, leave.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Death Peak is just to the right. Get ready to climb.

=====================
~Death Peak; 2300 AD~
=====================
This first area has strong winds. About every 8 seconds a strong wind will
blow and you'll be swept off the mountain. Head north, ignore the Poyozo
Doll for a second, then look right in the nook for a sparkling STRENGTH
CAPSULE. Now, after getting swept off the mountain, enter again and talk to
the doll. It'll tell you to stand behind trees to avoid being blown off.

This is kinda tricky. What you want to do is walk into the base of the tree
to avoid getting blown off. Running into the tree causes you to run around
it, not helping. For most of you using the default control scheme, hold B
to walk. When the wind dies down, walk north to another tree and repeat
the process. The exit to the next screen is up ahead. You'll barely make it
before the wind howls again.

In the next area the winds stay calm, so take your time. Head left and
fight some Blood Yolks. Head all the way left to find a MAGIC RING in the
chest. Back to where the yolks were are rocks on the cliff. Use those like
a ladder to climb higher. Head right to another group of Blood Yolks. Head
up the cliff and walk right off the screen.

Fight more enemies as soon as you enter the screen, then head north and
right down a hill. You walk across the shallow stream in this open area. At
the south area is a save point. Heal up, then head back the way you came,
up the short hill again, and north to a cave entrance. You'll have to fight
a few foes before you can enter. Make sure you're healed before going in.

You'll fight a Lavos Spawn inside. It's not terribly hard. It has an attack
which causes around 300 damage to everyone, but uses it rarely. It's also
its counter if you attack the shell. Attack the head only. Stuff like Flame
Kick are good Techs to use. Magic Techs are the best course of action. Just
remember to keep healed. It only has 4000 HP, so it goes down fast.

Once killed, grab the GIGATON ARM from the chest. Head north and out of the
cave. Once outside, follow the path right and south, and off the screen
back into a cave. Grab the chest here for a BRAVE SWORD, then keep moving
south. Fight the Blood Yolks, then move further south and out of the cave.
Once outside, look on the left ledge to see a sparkling object. Grab it to
make a hole in the wall down below open.

Head back through the cave (fight them Yolks again), loop around outside
to the cavern where you fought the Lavos Spawn, and to the large outer area
once more. Walk down the hill and back to the save point. Heal again, then
head right to find a chest with a BARRIER RING inside. Head north and enter
the cave in the wall you just opened.

Head up the stairs, grab a HADEAN SICKLE for Magus, fight the Blood Yolk,
then head north and out of the cave. You'll have to fight another Lavos
Spawn when you step outside. Repeat the process of hitting the core and not
the shell to win again. Once killed, proceed left to the next screen.

This area is tricky. As the Poyozo Doll warns, the ground is slippery. You
will constantly be moving to the bottom of the cliff if you don't react,
and if you fall off you'll drop back to the save point in the large
clearing from before. You'll need to walk back to the slippery slope to try
again. The trick is to be careful. Aim to stay in the middle of the pathway
and always be moving left. Don't try to stay still and move up and down as
you'll easily fail if you try. It'll take a few attempts, but you can make
it. I'm sure of it.

In the next screen Blood Yolks will be rolling down the cliff. Yes, easy
grinding spot if you wish it. Grab the YAKSHA BLADE from the chest on the
left, then head south down the cliff. Nothing special here. On the next
screen you'll be back in the area with the clearing and save point, except
on a high cliff to the left. Follow the linear path south and left to the
next screen.

Talk to the Poyozo Doll, then climb down the cliff to the left of it.
Follow the linear path south, left, then climb down the wall to the south,
grab a DARK HELM from a chest and save, then climb back up and go north.
One last Lavos Spawn will attack you here. Standard procedure now, I'm
sure. The difference now is that the shell will remain when the head is
killed. After the fight, push the shell to the right, then north against
the wall. Examine the shell to climb on top of it, such that you can climb
the rock ladder on the cliff to climb up it. Go right for a MEMORY CAP in
a chest, then proceed north to the next screen.

It's calm. Welcome to the summit. After the sun gets eclipsed, you'll get
transported back in time to the Lavos fight in the Ocean Palace, at the
exact moment Crono was killed. Examine Crono to switch his body with the
Doppel Doll.

                           ~5Y.The Fated Hour~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
~The End of Time~
=================
This is it. The endgame. With Crono revived you're ready to take down
Lavos.

Or are you?

Truthfully, Lavos can be beaten at any level. Even if your entire party was
at their base levels, he's still beatable. Of course, you'd need a crapton
of healing items and whatnot. The higher your levels, naturally, the easier
of a time you will have.

But, you don't have the best equipment for everyone. Not by a longshot. You
don't have the best, or at least really high quality, helms and armor
either. So, what options do you have right now?

-Do some fighting in the Arena of Ages for some gear
-Grab all the sealed chests, both in past and present
-Do the Lost Sanctum sidequest
-Perform the remaining sidequests
-Complete the Black Omen
-Kill Lavos

I advise doing tasks two and four. They delve out some of the best gear
with minimal effort, and they're pretty fun. Task one is a timewaster that
rarely hands out godly equipment (it can, but it's rare), and task three is
mindnumbingly tedious. If you're going to do the Lost Sanctum, do part of
it first, get pissed at it, do some real sidequests, then return to the
Lost Sanctum. That's the best way of doing things.

Task five is a huge dungeon with powerful enemies. Immensely great for
grinding, as well as swiping Speed, Magic, and Strength Capsules from
charming some of the enemies inside. For the record, you get an extra boss
at the end right before fighting Lavos.

If you're doing any of those tasks, please see the appropriate sections
(Arena of Ages, Sidequests, The Lost Sanctum, and The Black Omen
respectively)

Task six is, well, self-explanatory. However, you've got some options for
beating Lavos. Yeah, you get options on how to cater your final boss fight!
See, Lavos has a total of four forms: A boss rush form, his shell
(basically the fight at the Ocean Palace made possible at your levels), his
core, and finally his true form.

Because no final boss can go without many forms.

However, the method you use to visit Lavos determines which forms you skip.
-If you take the bucket in The End of Time, or fight Lavos in the Black
Omen, you fight all four forms
-If you use the right telepod in Leene Square you will skip the boss rush
form
-If you choose to use the Epoch to warp to 1999 AD and crash the ship into
Lavos, you skip both the boss rush and shell forms

Note that if you take the third option the standard ending isn't as neat
in my opinion. It changes only a few minor things, but I'm kinda bugged by
them. But it matters not what you ultimately choose.

I'll describe how to beat each form. Skip the ones you're not fighting
depending on the method you use to reach him. I advise doing the sidequests
because Lavos is a pain in the ass unless you're at least at level 45.
Before you fight, make sure you have plenty of healing items.

There's no save points before Lavos, so if you choose to fight him and get
screwed over, don't worry about it. You're not stuck there or anything. The
exception to this is if you fight him through the bucket or from the Black
Omen. You can save after beating his boss rush and shell forms. Next to the
save point is a warp back to the End of Time. If you take it, when you take
the bucket back to the Lavos fight the hole in Lavos's shell will remain
and the first two forms stay dead for good.

Finally, I also advise getting every character you plan on using through
the fights all their Techs. Any team can beat the final boss, but a team
of Crono/Ayla/Robo remains one of the best in the game. But any combo of
three characters will suffice. Just remember that Crono doesn't have to be
in the party anymore. If you wanna win with Magus/Frog/Marle or some other
odd combo, that's fine as well.

Recommended Levels-45+
----------------------------
I suppose the point of this is to exclaim how awesome the extended Lavos
theme is. It's awesome. Really. The Boss Rush Form is insanely easy.
Basically, you're fighting ten previous bosses. At this point, none of
them should damage you much or take long to kill. If you need a quick
refresher on how to kill all of them, here you go:
(Note that you have time to heal between fights. To trigger the next boss
attack you'll need to walk into the Lavos head)

Dragon Tank--The Lavos head is the tank's head, the right bit is the wheel,
and left bit is the body. Kill the head first, then the wheels, then the
body.

Guardian--The two bits to the sides of Lavos are the Pods. Kill both of
them before attacking the Guardian (Lavos's head). Although at this point
you could just go Rambo on the head and their counterattack probably won't
harm you all that much.

Heckran--A few magic attacks is all that'll be needed to kill off the lone
boss.

Zombor--The bit infront of the head is the lower body, while Lavos's head
is the upper body. Kill the lower body first (Fire and Light techs are the
only magic types that can hit it), then Lavos's head (only Water and Shadow
magic types can hit it). Physical attacks also work here no matter what.

Masa & Mune--A few magic attacks is all that should be needed to finish
this fight off quickly. None of his attacks are damaging, except if he
charges energy and you somehow don't kill him in time (and even then it's
a pitiful amount of damage).

Nizbel--Use a Lightning attack to lower his defenses, then go all out on
him with powerful physical attacks. Shouldn't take too many of them before
the boss is killed.

Magus--Hitting him causes Lavos to change barriers. The attack he uses is
the magic type he is weak to (uses Fire II, he's weak to fire moves, and so
on). After a little bit of damage he'll lower his defenses completely to
charge for Dark Matter. Smash him with everything you've got to so you
hopefully won't have to endure the damage it causes.

Black Tyranno--The left bit is Azala. She needs to be killed first, and it
should only take a few magic moves to do so. Once killed, wait for the
message to appear saying "Lowers Defense and begins storing power". Go all
out on Lavos's head at this point. You should be able to kill it before
the countdown reaches 0 and the powerful magic attack Tyranno Flame gets
used.

Giga Gaia--The left and right pods represent Giga Gaia's hands. Use Falcon
Strike or a hit-all move to smash them off quickly, then go all out on
Giga Gaia. He doesn't have a ton of HP, so he should fall very quickly
after a few strong attacks.

After killing the last boss, you'll have one last chance to heal before you
fight Lavos for real.

Recommended Levels-45+
----------------------------
Lavos starts right off using Destruction Rains from the Heavens, causing
massive damage to your entire team. He uses this move rarely from that
point on, so take the time to heal. Chaos Zone does very little damage, but
obviously causes confusion if you don't have one of those awesome status
effect-immunity armors/helms equipped.

Lavos Needle will do around 300 damage to a single member of the party, and
Earth Quake harms everyone for a moderate amount. There's honestly not much
else to say about this fight as you're just using your strongest attacks
against a single head.

Life Grip (Restores Body's HP)
Curse (Nullifies status immunity)
Immobilize (Stop)

Recommended Levels-45+
----------------------------
This fight is much, much harder. Lavos's nipple lasers activate right at
the start of the battle and it's impossible to get a move in before they
fire. This attack does twice as much damage as Destruction Rains from the
Heavens does. Immediately heal the damage, as like that move he uses his
lasers very, very rarely.

Now, both arms have the same attacks. The Right arm (Lavos's right, your
left) has lower HP, so naturally you will want to get that out of the way
first to ease the pain you'll be enduring through the fight. Powerful hit-
all attacks also work quite nicely, as they'll hit both arms for quite a
good amount of damage. Falcon Strike is great for hitting the arms as well,
and so are hit-all Triple Techs such as Twister.

When the Right Arm is down, focus on the Left Arm, naturally. If you had
been using hit-all attacks, its HP should be drained a bit already, so just
a little more and it will fall as well. The Arms don't get revived, so
pressure in this fight is definitely alleviated a bit when one is dead. The
nipple lasers also can't fire if one of the Arms is dead.

The remaining Arm will likely use its more annoying Techs now. Curse does a
decent amount of damage and nullfies status immunity to whoever it hits.
It'll likely follow up with Immobilize, so cure it with a Panacea quickly.

Once both Arms are killed, the Lavos Body will lower it's defenses. It'll
also now start using it's primary Techs. All of his attacks are quite
painful, and if he uses Evil Emanation you'll probably want to end the
fight not long after that (although by the time he uses it you should be
close to victory).

Dark Flame's Embrace is his strongest attack, and will probably one shot
someone on your team, if not everyone. It easily does 500+ damage to
everyone. Use Athenian Waters and Hi-Potions after the attack to get
everyone back to high HP.

Lavos generally loops through his Tech list, so he'll use a few weaker
Techs before going gung-ho on Dark Flame's Embrace. Use the time to stay
at high HP, and make sure you're still at high HP when you strike the
finishing blow.

Recommended Levels-45+
----------------------------
This is it. The Final Final Final Boss. And boy does it make little sense.
The small pod on the right is the actual Lavos Core. Once it dies, Lavos
is gone for good. Of course, draining its 30000 HP isn't going to be very
easy, and it has those insane defenses...

Firstly, you must destroy one of the other pods. Doesn't matter which. The
Lavos Pod has a mere 2000 HP, but it absorbs all magic attacks. Even so, a
single Frenzy Tech from Crono takes it down, and if you don't have that
then one or two physical Techs will destroy the pod.

In the interim, try damaging the Center Pod but don't waste a whole lot of
MP doing so. A little bit after destroying a pod, the Lavos Core will lower
its defenses in preparation for reviving the pods. Smack it with everything
you have. You can get 6-11 attacks in before the pods revive. When the pods
revive, the Lavos Core's defenses will still be lowered for a short period
of time, so don't stop attacking until the message saying it restores its
defenses appears. This process repeats until you've drained the Lavos 
Core's HP, and Lavos is no more.

As far as Lavos's attacks, they're strong. Very strong. The Core honestly
can't do much (thank goodness), and the Lavos Pod doesn't have terribly bad
attacks. It's the Center Pod and its high HP goodness that's the main
threat. It rarely uses its Ultimate Attacks, which totally obliterate your
team if hit. Heal right away, naturally. Hopefully you won't have been hit
by Curse so if you have status immune armor his Diabolic Whisper will be of
no effect. Demon Star is annoying, but a little healing can get past that.
Grandstone, Lavos's ultimate physical attack, is insanely powerful. It'll
do 500+ to your entire party, making it less threatening than Dreamreaver,
but the damage is so significant you'll want to heal right away.

Temporal Shift changes the background to that of a random era you've
visited. I'm not entirely sure what it does (nobody really is, actually).
I think it somewhat effects the Center Pod's attack pattern, and it
sometimes drains a little HP without the damage dealt appearing over your
head, usually just 5-25 of it. It's an odd move.

Don't be afraid to use any Megalixirs you've acquired through the
sidequests. Their effects are lifesavers in many situations, especially
after Dreamreaver, which is a team raper for sure. That move will do around
700+ damage to everyone. 

Ultimately, stay above 700 HP at all costs. I can say that with certainty--
as I'm writing this fight I lost when the core has but 800 HP left. And it
was Dreamraper that did me in. Don't let that happen to you. Not to
mention it just loves stacking on damage. Just stay at high HP and guzzle
down Megalixirs when in a pinch.
===========================================================================
Well, that's it. If you had to revive Crono then you'll receive Ending 1,
which is probably the best of the endings. And with your first beating of
the game, the...

New Game + is unlocked! With it you can start the game over again, but keep
your stats, inventory, and equipment. Great stuff! Also, three purple
vortexes will appear in three separate eras. You can now visit the
Dimensional Vortex in that file, and in it contains the ultimate weapons
for all of the characters, except one.

===========================================================================
                         ~6.New Game + and Extras~
===========================================================================
After finishing the game, the New Game + option will be added to the main
menu, as well as the Extras option.

If you want a New Game +, select the option and then the file you wish to
start the NG+ in. The file you choose does not have to have had the game
beaten, although in order to unlock the option in the first place you need
to have beaten the game once.

When you start a New Game +, you start right from the beginning of the
game, naturally. You'll have to regain all of your partners again, however,
so you're basically living through the story again.

All stats, Exp, and Techs are carried over from NG+ to NG+. Thusly, you can
pretty much rip through the entire game and laugh at the bosses that once
gave you trouble as you obliterate them in one or two shots. The only thing
that does not carry over is your cash. Spend all of it before starting a
New Game + because you'll start with the default 0 again.

Your inventory, bestiary, and equipment carry over as well. The only catch
on your equipment is that all of your characters will be wearing their
default weapons, armor/helms, and accessory (except for Ayla's weapon which
is based on her current level). You'll have to re-equip everyone equipment
again, but it's not much of a hassle.

For the Extras option, you can now view specific new things added to the DS
version. The first option is the Theater, which allows you to replay any of
the videos that played during the game. The first nine movies are acquired
by playing the game to the first ending, however the tenth video plays when
you obtain Ending 13.

The Art Gallery allows you to view all of the concept art of characters
within the game. You'll obtain almost all the pictures by going for the
first ending, and you can get pics 24-30 by going for collecting every
ending in the game.

In the Music Box you can, obviously, listen to all of the music in the
game. All of the music is unlocked from the start.

The Dojo is a list of all of the Techs you've unlocked in the game, also
showing the characters used in the Techs, TP needed, and a nice picture of
the Tech in action.

The Bestiary is exactly the same as the one accessable in the menu while
playing the game. Nothing special about it here.

The Item Encyclopedia lists every item you've collected in the game, or
ever had in your inventory at some point. It also shows the description and
effect of each item, shops, chests, beaten enemies, and charmed foes where
you can find it, and the purchase and sell price (if any).

The Ending Log lists the endings you have acquired, a picture to go along
with it, and the details on how to obtain each ending.

The Treasure Atlas shows the location of every single item you can find in
chests and off of sparkly spots on the ground. You can only view eras you
have visited. The last two areas are not eras, but the Dimensional Vortex
and Lost Sanctum. They won't appear there until you've beaten the Dream
Devourer and cleared every sidequest in the sanctum respectively.

                              ~7.Sidequests~
===========================================================================
Any good RPG has plenty of sidequests to keep the player occupied. Whether
they add to the story, hand out some awesome items, or a combo of those,
they are generally worth the time and effort you put in to them.

There aren't a *ton* of sidequests in Chrono Trigger, but it is a decent
amount that should preoccupy you for several hours. The order they are
listed here are in reverse order of what you should do--basically it's from
the worst rewards to the best. It's really my opinion on the rewards, but
I'm sure you'll feel the same once you get these items equipped.

All of the sidequests pretty much require the flying Epoch. As soon as you
have it, you can perform these sidequests with ease.

                    ~7A.The Fiendlord's Comrades Keep~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Use the Epoch to fly to the island right of the Fiendlord's Keep. You will
spot a small tower in the center of a forest, much like the keep. Enter
Ozzie's Fort.

======================
~Ozzie's Fort; 600 AD~
======================
I suggest having Magus in the party to make the conversations in this place
a bit more interesting. Proceed north to the next room for the first of the
boss fights.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Diva Flea
HP-2500
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-2000/TP-20/G-2000

Techs:
Heartfire

Recommended Levels-35+
----------------------------
A real joke fight. That move will barely harm you, and it should only take
three strong Techs to take her down.
===========================================================================
Head upstairs to the next room. After Ozzie embarrasses himself trying to
get some foes to hit you, chase him up another flight of stairs to another
empty room.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Super Slash
HP-2500
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-2000/TP-20/G-2000

Techs:
Wind Slash (Light Tech)

Recommended Levels-35+
----------------------------
Another joke fight. Should only take a few attacks to knock him out.
===========================================================================
Head upstairs. Ignore Ozzie's ploy to get you skewered and keep heading
right. After an Imp gets hit by the axe, you can freely grab the HI-ETHER
from the chest. Head to the far right wall and walk south. You can walk
through the suspicious wall and into a hidden room with three chests
holding a GLOOM CAPE, GLOOM HELM, and DOOM SCYTHE, all for Magus. Good
stuff. To the right of the chests is a sparkly MAGIC CAPSULE. Now, head
upstairs. I advise putting Ayla in your party so you can Charm three unique
items.

Recommended Levels-37+
----------------------------
Oh boy. You're not going to have fun with this fight. Your first priority
should be Charming everyone's unique items (Flea Bustier, Slasher II,
Ozzie Pants). The thing is, after every attack, and that includes Charm,
they'll use their Triple Tech, Delta Force. It does around 300 damage to
whoever it hits, but that's still quite powerful. The way it works is the
amount of members it hits is the same as the amount of foes you hit. Hit
all three, all three party members get hurt. Hit one, and it's just one
that's hurt. Don't use any hit-all moves. You'll quickly regret it.

You should kill Diva Flea first. She doesn't use those status inflicting
moves too often, but you're in for a world of hurt if she dares use them.
It still takes only a few attacks for her to fall, so it shouldn't be too
much trouble if you hurry and have someone keep the party healed from their
Delta Force move.

They can't use Delta Force with one member missing, making the rest of the
fight much easier. They pretty much stop using powerful attacks now, so
a few more bashes against the remaining two bosses and it'll be over. For
the record, Ozzie has no attacks other than his partner counters. Saving
him for last is definitely best.
===========================================================================
Ozzie will run off yet again. Grab the CLARITY CAP and SPEED RING from the
chests near the stairs, then head up them. You'll fight Ozzie again up
here, much like you did in the Fiendlord's Keep. Attack the ??? switch and
not Ozzie himself.

It was a trap, though. You just fall back to the previous room. Head back
upstairs and fight him again for...well, yeah. And with that, this
sidequest is over.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ~7B.The Legendary Sun Stone~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
One of the shortest sidequests in the game. To start with, head for the Sun
Temple. It is on a lone island in the bottom left corner of the map. Before
entering, I advise making a team of Magus, Lucca, and anyone else. It's
completely irrelevant who (damage output is not important in the next
battle), but you'll want whoever has the highest Magic Defense. Lucca and
Magus have the highest in the game, with Marle, Frog, and Ayla close
behind. If you can't beat the boss ahead, I advise getting helping armor
from the Sealed Chests sidequest. The Red Plate and Mail is immensely
useful here. Ruby Vests are also advised for the third member, although at
this point in the game you can make a trade in the trading hut in
65,000,000 BC for Ruby Armor, which is far superior.

=====================
~Sun Temple; 2300 AD~

Head to the center of the room for a boss fight.

Flare (Fire Tech)          Roulette Spin

Prominence Techs:
Flame Counterattack (Fire Tech)

Recommended Levels-38+
----------------------------
A simple to understand fight. You will be wanting high Magic Defense units
as everything here is magic based. If your team has Ruby Armor or stuff
like Red Plates, you'll either reduce damage from Fire attacks, or absorb
them completely, making the fight that much easier. Actually, the battle
is nearly impossible with Fire-reducing armor. Seriously, you'll be raped
likely before you can damage the damn thing one bit.

Now, the objective of the fight is merely to kill Son of the Sun. However,
he cannot be hurt normally. To harm him, you must hit one of the five
Prominences. Only one of them will harm Son of the Sun, and the other four
will hit you with Flame Counterattack. The Prominence that harms Son of the
Sun will always harm him until he uses Roulette Spin, at which point you
will need to keep trying to find which one hurts him.

The reason damage output is irrelevant is because each correct Prominence
hit does ~215 damage to Son of the Sun, no matter what. An alternative to
finding which Prominence harms Son of the Sun is to use a hit-all move. The
Promy that doesn't make an attack is obviously the one that hurts him.
However, you'll be facing five counterattacks if you do so. It's advised
to just use regular attacks as, again, damage output does not matter. It
takes about 11 hits to kill him (yes, I'm aware that's only about 4500 HP
worth of damage. I'm actually on the train of thought the battle merely
ends after a certain amount of turns as that is simply too short).
===========================================================================
Once defeated, head to the back of the room. Son of the Sun will be here,
but he'll quickly disappear, leaving behind a black rock. Grab the Moon
Stone it leaves behind. Robo pretty much made the answer with what to do
with it obvious.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Hop on the Epoch and warp to 65,000,000 BC.

==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Fly to the island in the top right corner of the map.

===========================
~Sun Shrine; 65,000,000 BC~
===========================
Examine the sparkling spot at the end and choose to place the Moon Stone
there. Now leave, get on the Epoch, and warp back to 2300 AD.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Get off on the top right corner's island and enter the same shrine.

=====================
~Sun Shrine; 2300 AD~
=====================
Head to the spot where the rock is (how is there sun here? On the world map
the world is clearly in darkness...) to discover it's been stolen. Now
leave and warp to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head to the town of Porre in the bottom left continent. You'll notice that
the Mayor's Manor is sparkling. Enter it. Talk with the mayor and he will
deny ever taking the Moon Stone.

Leave and visit the Snail Shop by the docks. Purchase the Spiced Jerky
for 9900G. Now warp to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head inside the Elder's House. Talk to the mother and she will offer to pay
you for your Spiced Jerky. Choose to give it to her for free. Now head back
to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head inside the Mayor's Manor. By altering the timeline the mayor is
actually really nice now. He'll simply hand over the Moon Stone to you when
asked. Now, with it in hand, head over to the Sun Shrine still located in
the top right corner of the map.

=====================
~Sun Shrine; 1000 AD~
=====================
Head back to the shining spot and place the Moon Stone there. Get on the
Epoch and warp to 2300 AD once more.

=====================
~Sun Shrine; 2300 AD~
=====================
Put Lucca into the party, then examine the Sun Stone. She says she can make
a weapon with the glowing ball of energy.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
You'll obtain the WONDERSHOT, and Taban will also give you the SUNGLASSSES.
Clever. That's it, that's all you're getting from all the damn work making
a rock glow.

                        ~7C.Fiona and the Desert~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================
~Village Commons; 12,000 BC~
============================
Recall that this is the forest/mountainside area near all the huts. Talk to
the Zeal woman closest to the entrance. Tell her to plant the seed with
hope. With that, head to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Fly to Fiona's Villa. It's on the bottom left continent, in the middle of
the desert. Not terribly hard to miss. Talk to her twice and she will note
that plants can't grow with creatures infesting the desert nearby. Bring
some healing items as the foes in the Sunken Desert right outside of her
house hit pretty hard.

=======================
~Sunken Desert; 600 AD~
=======================
Walk into the center of the dark sand to drop down to a cavern below. Grab
the LAPIS from the chest where you land. Head left as best as possible,
kill off any enemies you encounter quickly before they can harm you too
much, then collect a HI-ETHER from the chest on the left wall. As a note,
using a Water or Ice Tech on a foe will severely reduce their Defense. I
advise using something like Water II on foes to make fights easier.

Grab an ELIXIR from the chest in the bottom left corner. Survive your way
to an AEONIAN SUIT in a chest in the bottom right corner. The south-middle
of the room leads to the next area of the desert. You'll find a large
monster come out of the sand. Ignore the chests for now because each time
the thing roars your team loses HP. Hurry and come close to the boss for a
fight. Be sure Frog and/or Marle is in your party.

Recommended Levels-38+
----------------------------
An annoying boss fight, for sure. What you want to do first is use a Water/
Ice Tech on the boss, and if it's not a hit-all then aim for the Core
first. Water/Ice Techs weaken their Defense much like the other foes in
this desert. With the Core's Defense down, a few physical attacks will
easily kill it.

This way the remaining body cannot heal itself throughout the fight. The
trick is that its Defense goes up a bit when attacked, so you'll need to
keep using a Water/Ice Tech to weaken it again. You'll want to focus on the
Lower Body first as it has less HP, so it can be killed faster.

The head has a lot of attacks, but they mainly only hit one party member
while the lower half can hit the entire party easier. That makes it more
dangerous. And it goes without saying that you will have a much easier time
with the fight when only the Upper Body remains the fight becomes much
easier. Keep yourself healed and you can easily win at that point.
===========================================================================
Head around the room and collect the HI-POTION, 5000G, TURBO ETHER, AEONIAN
HELM, MEMORY CAP, HI-ETHER, and MUSCLE RING from the group of chests. Near
the center of the first room you can find a sparkling STRENGTH CAPSULE.
Grab it on your way out.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head inside Fiona's Villa and talk to her. Make sure Robo is in your party
when you do so. Agree to let Robo stay here and help her plant the forest.
Hop in the Epoch and warp ahead 400 years.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Now a large forest has grown in this area over the years. Yay for messing
with time. In the center of the forest you can find Fiona's Shrine. Head
inside.

=========================
~Fiona's Shrine; 1000 AD~
=========================
The second nun on the right has a shop. She has only helms available, but
they are quite good, although extremely expensive. Don't buy too much if
you don't have the funds. Now, go examine Robo at the end of the shrine to
reboot him.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Your entire party will have a little get-together outside around a campfire
(yes, it makes sense. Just think about it for a minute).

In the middle of the night Lucca will awaken and you'll have control over
her. Exit the screen to the right to find a Time Gate. Enter it to be
transported to an unknown point in time. Read the note on the floor, then
head downstairs. Enter the room and read another note. Then head back to
the previous room and exit to the south.

You'll witness an event from Lucca's past in here. When the time comes
(and you'll know when), you'll need to enter a password to shut down the
machine. The switch is the sparkling object a little south and right of
where you're standing. It's on the machine itself. When asked for the
password, press the A button to make the dialogue box close, then press the
following buttons, one at a time, making sure the "ding" noise comes before
pressing the next button:
L, A, R, A

If you read the notes, that's her name. Lara. Woo. If you fail to shut down
the machine in time, history remains unchanged as Lara still loses her
legs. But if you do save her, she's capable of walking in the future. When
you wake up in Lucca's room again, the Time Gate will be there. Enter it.

Talk to Robo when you arrive. Regardless if you saved Lara or not, he will
hand you the Green Dream. This accessory will fully revive the wearer when
KO'd in combat. Problem is that it only has one use. Once it's used, it's
gone forever. Use it wisely.

And with that, the sidequest ends.

                          ~7D.The Hero's Grave~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Use the Epoch to fly to the bottom right continent, holding the small
Choras Village. If you wish, head inside the Inn and talk to people to
learn about what's inside your next destination. After that, head north to
the large Northern Ruins castle.

=========================
~Northern Ruins; 1000 AD~
=========================
You'll find the ghost of Cyrus on the left as you enter. You'll quickly
find out that it's impossible to hurt him. All you can do now is attack a
few times to end the battle, then leave.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head back to the Epoch, this time warping to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
When you land, walk into Choras Village again and enter the Tavern. Inside,
talk to the man drinking at the table closest to the entrance to learn he's
lost his carpentry tools. Warp back to 1000 AD now.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head inside Choras Inn, then talk to the man drinking at the bar on the
left (he looks just like the carpenter in 600 AD). He'll state that his
tools are with his wife right now. Leave the inn and south to the Residence
building. Talk to his wife inside. She'll gladly give you his tools. Now
warp once again to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
I swear we're done warping for awhile. Head inside the Tavern and talk with
the carpenter and agree to hand him the tools. Leave the tavern and head a
little south to the Residence. Talk to the carpenter inside and him and his
team will head to the Northern Ruins to fix the place up a bit. Leave the
building and follow his team up there.

========================
~Northern Ruins; 600 AD~
========================
When you enter the carpenter will notify you that he can't repair rooms
that are infested with monsters. Thusly, we should go kill them off. Should
be pretty easy. Head down the stairs on the left. At the bottom, fight the
pair of Ghost Knights (they can only be hurt by magic attacks). They also
have MP Buster when killed, and love the spam a powerful HP sucking attack.
These guys REALLY suck.

Once killed, hopefully quickly, head right and kill another pair of these
bastards. Head left after finding a giant hole infront of the door and you
will have to fight a group of FOUR Ghost Knights. Jeez. They really don't
want you here, hm? Spam hit-all magic attacks if you want any real chance
of getting out of here alive. When everyone is dead, head back upstairs.

This time head to the right end of the hallway and up the stairs. Head
through the door in this small room to end up in a large room. You will
have to kill all three groups of Fallen and Flesh Reapers in this room.
Luckily these guys are a lot less annoying, and shouldn't take as much
effort to take down. They can also be hit by physical attacks, so that's
nice (although magical moves deal a lot more damage).

You've cleared out every enemy you have access to in the building so far,
so all that's left to do now is leave.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head back to the village, heal up if you need to, and into the Residence.
Talk to the carpenter inside and he'll repair more of the Northern Ruins
if you pay him 2000G. Pay the man, then follow him back to the ruins.

========================
~Northern Ruins; 600 AD~
========================
Once again he can't repair monster infested areas, but you'll at least be
able to make some more progress here.

Head down the stairs on the left and proceed through the empty room and the
now accessable door at the end, grabbing the TURBO ETHER just before it
from a chest. Put Frog in your group somewhere, then examine the gravestone
at the back end of the room. Once the long cutscene between Frog and Cyrus
ends, Frog will obtain the upgraded Masamune. It's attack power is now
heavily boosted.

Return to the entry hallway, then leave the ruins.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Walk back to the Residence and pay the carpenter 2000G once again. Head
back to the ruins (now called Hero's Grave) when you finish.

======================
~Hero's Grave; 600 AD~
======================
The carpenter says that there's nothing left in the ruins to repair beyond
this point. All that's left is a little bit to explore. Head up the stairs
on the right, through the tiny room and into the large room. Head through
the door on the left to reach an ELIXIR in a chest. The door on the right
also guards a tiny room, but inside is a sealed chest. If you're doing the
Sealed Chests sidequest, examine it and choose not to open it. If you're
not, you should do that anyway as it'll help later on down the road.

Head to the north end of the room and enter the next room. You'll fight two
Flesh Reapers in the tiny room you enter. Head up the stairs and through a
door to the next room. Fight through the droves of Fallens and Souls as
you make your way to the top of the room (of note is that a Fallen and Soul
can merge to an entirely new enemy, and this is the ONLY chance in the game
to see it. Simply kill one Fallen and one Soul in the fights, leaving only
one Fallen and Soul on the field. Then just wait for them to merge).

After killing both droves of Fallens and Souls, you'll find two more
sealed chests at the end. Like the other one, you should examine both and
choose not to open them. That's it for Hero's Grave, although there's one
last item you can obtain. Leave and warp to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Land near the ruins and enter it.

=======================
~Hero's Grave; 1000 AD~
=======================
With Cyrus rested and out of the way, you can head downstairs to his grave.
You can find a sparkly MAGIC CAPSULE to the left of his grave. You can
also go to all the locations where those sealed chests were in 600 AD and
open them now, but only do this if you examined them in 600 AD and did not
open them.

And with that this sidequest is finished.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~7E.The Geno Dome~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
You're headed for the Geno Dome, a factory located on an island in the
bottom right corner of the world. It's the only thing on the island, so it
shouldn't be hard to find.

====================
~Geno Dome; 2300 AD~
====================
Robo MUST be the head of your party to perform this sidequest. Examine the
computer console and a hatch will open on the right, while the exit seals
off. Uh-oh. Get ready for the greatest grinding spot in the game, bar none.

Welcome to the Geno Dome Conveyor Belt. It's five somewhat simple fights
all in a row, totaling roughly 7600 Exp and a large sum of G and TP. All
you really need to do for each group is use a strong hit-all magic move
once or twice. Gold Stud'd Crono Luminaire, or anything from a Gold Stud'd 
Magus, works perfectly for this job. And all of this, if you're quick, 
takes about 90 seconds to complete. And you probably didn't put a ton of 
effort into it to begin with!

Enter the room at the end when you get off the conveyor belt of awesome.
Head right. This is a huge room with lots to do, and all of it you HAVE to
do. The sparkly thing at the right side of the room is a trash chute back
to the entry room of the dome. The exit will be opened if you use this
route so you can leave at any time. Better, you can opt to do the conveyor
belt again (and you must to reach this room again). So, basically,
grindfest central. Be warned that if you complete the Geno Dome you can't
access this belt. You've been warned.

The door just left of the sparkly shoot houses an elevator to the second
floor. Just after you get out on the second floor you'll find a save point.
Don't go any further than the save point. We'll get there later. Starting
from where you started in the first floor, you can head all the way left
for a fight, and find a green robot blocking access to a chest and...
Poyozo Doll?

Slightly right of this area is a hallway going north. Before fighting them,
notice that one of them enters a pod and has electricity circling around
it. After the fight, grab the HI-POTION from the chest, then have Robo
enter the pod just to the right of the chest. Electricity will be circling
around him now for a short time. You can use this electricity to power up
other pods on the first floor, allowing access to new areas.

Head south down the hallway, then a little right. You should notice the
door on the wall that is closed, the red light next to it signaling it
can't be opened right now. Just right of this door is a pod and a switch on
the wall. Examine the switch to open the pod, then have Robo enter it while
electrified. The door opens, so enter the small storage room. Inside is a
HI-POTION and 50000G from chests. Very nice.

Head back to the pod up the hallway where you got Robo electrified. Next to
it is a computer terminal you can use to find out more about the Geno Dome
and how to access new areas, if you wish to know ahead of time. Ignore the
pod for a moment and head left and north through the door. Head all the way
north to get into a fight with some Laser Guards on the floor. After
killing them you can access the north end of the hallway, where three
switches lie. Activate the left and right switches so only the middle one
is green. This opens up the pod a little south of you.

Now, get in the pod that electrifies Robo again, then go a little left and
through the door. Run to the now open pod, subsequently opening the door
next to it. Enter it and collect the Poyozo Doll inside. A sparkly spot is
on the green circle the doll was sitting on, so examine it for a SPEED
CAPSULE. Very nice.

Now, leave that small room and make your way to the bottom right corner of
the first floor. The area with the chute back to the entrance, I mean. Kill
the foes here and proceed north. Go through the door on the north wall next
to the conveyor belt and you'll have to fight some Version 4.0's before you
can obtain the ELIXIR and LAPIS from the pair of chests. Don't waste your
time running up the conveyor belt. A confusing brief scene with a robot is
at the end, but it does nothing to help (or harm) you. Instead, go back to
the garbage chute sparkly place and enter the door just left of that. Use
the elevator inside to go to the 2nd floor.

Save at the save point, then enter the door left of the door housing the
elevator. As soon as you enter the red floored hallway, grab the sparkly
in the bottom right corner for a STRENGTH CAPSULE. Now keep heading north
through the hallway, and after the head of the Dome taunts you some more,
head off the screen at the north end to the next room.

Fight the Version 4.0's and Laser Guards after trying to leave through the
north door. Once killed, enter the north door for real. Head down the
elevator to be back in the first floor, this time at the north end of that
acursed conveyor belt. Head directly left and you'll walk through the wall.
Once on the other side, head south then right to find a switch on the wall.
Press it to reverse the direction of the conveyor belt.

Head back to the door leading to the elevator, but don't go in. Head south
this time, defeating the Laser Guards on your way, then at the south end
you'll find a red laser blocking access to the belt. Press the switch on
the wall to deactivate it, then head left across the belt to find another
switch an a pod. Press the switch to open the pod.

Now, get on the belt and run south to the bottom right corner of the floor.
Run back to the center of the area and to the pod that charges Robo. Get
electrified, then trace your steps right back to the conveyor belt. Run
north to the opening on the left, then get inside the pod to open the door
next to it. There's barely enough time to reach the pod before the charge
in Robo runs out, so you must hurry.

Enter the now open room and grab the HI-ETHER and TURBO ETHER, then examine
the robot next to the chests. The robot will now start following Robo, so
your objective now is to guide him back to the similar looking robot on the
bottom left area of the first floor. Head right to the conveyor belt and
head south along it (the robot gets stuck easily behind things, so take
your time). Head south to the garbage chute sparkly spot, then head all the
way down the left hallway. At the end, head north to find the similar
looking robot. Walk next to the robot that blocks your path and your
follower will distract him.

This allows access to the chest behind them, holding a VIGILANT'S HAT, and
the second Poyozo Doll. Grab it, then head to the bottom right corner of
the floor again. Take the elevator left of the sparkly up to the second
floor. Save, then head south and fight some Laser Guards, grab a LAPIS from
the chest in the corner, then head left to the clearing.

If you collected both Poyozo Dolls, Robo's friend Atropos will appear. Robo
will fly solo on this battle.

It should only take a few attacks before she self-destructs, ending the
fight. If she doesn't, draining her 6000 HP isn't terribly hard as few of
her attacks deal significant damage to Robo.
===========================================================================
You'll obtain Atropos's Ribbon after the fight, which doesn't need to be
equipped and permanently raises Robo's Speed by 3 and his Magic Defense by
10. Very nice. Now, approach the red switch next to the red lasers in the
north and Robo will jump and flip it. Grab the MEGALIXIR from the chest the
lasers were guarding (this baby restores the entire party's HP and MP in
combat, making it one of the best items in the game).

Head left and north, then left more and the Dome's computer will further
taunt you. Head down the ladder south of you to reach a chest holding
15000G, then follow the path north from the chest and through a door. You
will discover people being killed in this room, and the only way to stop
them is to shut down the Mother Brain mainframe. Leave from the bottom
right corner.

In the next room, grab a chest for a HI-ETHER, then head back through the
previous room and go all the way back to the ladder you climbed down. Climb
up it and head left and north. Fight a group of Laser Guards, then head
north and fight another group. Before going further, head back and use a
Shelter at the save point and save the game. Head back to where you fought
the last pair of guards and place a Poyozo Doll on each of the green spots
to the left and right of the large door. When it opens, head north for the
boss fight.

----------------------------
And not the Metroid kind. Simply put the fight is insanely easy. Use a hit-
all attack to destroy the three Displays and harm Mother Brain, then go
all out on her. With pathetic HP like that she doesn't last very long. Its
strongest attacks deal about 100 damage to everyone's, so the fight should
not last more than a minute.
===========================================================================
You'll obtain the TERATON ARM and CRISIS ARM for winning. And with that,
you're kicked out of the Dome and can never reenter it's depths again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       ~7F.Secretive Sealed Chests~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright, simply put you're capable of getting a ton of awesome items
through this sidequest. You'll need the upgraded pendant, however.
Throughout your trek in 600 AD you probably noticed a bunch of small black
chests that were "mysteriously sealed". The charged pendant can open them,
however...

Even BETTER goodies are in store if you examine them and choose to not open
them. The chest will appear in the same spot in 1000 AD, at which point you
can open it there and claim the item. However, said item will have upgraded
to an even better item. You can then go back to 600 AD and open the chest
there for the normal, but generally inferior, item.

So, in summary:
Examine chest in 600 AD > Choose not to open > Open chest in 1000 AD > Open
chest in 600 AD

For those who think they can handle exploration on their own, here's the
locations of every sealed chest, and unless otherwise noted the chest(s)
exist in the location in 600 AD and then 1000 AD as well when you decline
opening them:
-Truce Inn
-Porre Village (Elder's House)
-Guardia Castle
-Guardia Forest (600 AD only)
-Northern Ruins/Hero's Grave
-Guardia Forest (1000 AD only, accessed through Time Gate in Bangor Dome)
-Heckran's Cave (1000 AD only)
-Forest Ruins

For those who wish to be led through the path to get every last chest item,
look below. Some of these chests are slightly hard to find, and that's
understandable. My path isn't the most efficient, and you can do these in
any order you wish, naturally.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Use the Epoch to fly to Truce village, then enter the Inn. Head left and up
the stairs. Next to the far right bed is a black chest. Examine it and
choose to not remove the item.

Leave the building and hop back on the Epoch. This time fly to the bottom
left continent and the village of Porre. It's at the very bottom. Enter the
Elder's House on the left. The right side of the house has two black
chests, so repeat the process of examining both and declining from opening
them.

Now fly up to Guardia Castle. You can skip over the forest if you land on
the steps of the castle and get off.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
Head north to the King's chambers and follow the path left. Head up three
flights of stairs and you'll spot a sealed chest along the south wall.
Examine and don't open the chest, then head back downstairs and leave the
castle. Enter Guardia Forest after you leave.

========================
~Guardia Forest; 600 AD~
========================
As soon as you enter, head right. At the end of the path you'll find a
sealed chest. Examine the chest to obtain a SPEED CAPSULE. After you
collect it, leave the forest.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Hop on the Epoch and fly to the bottom right continent and the village of
Choras. To the north of the village is the Hero's Grave. Enter it.

======================
~Hero's Grave; 600 AD~
======================
Please note that if you have not done "The Hero's Grave" sidequest, you
won't be able to access the sealed chests in here (and the place will still
be called Northern Ruins). Assuming you've done that sidequest, head up the
stairs on the right and through the door in the small room you reach.

In the large room, head through the door on the right and you'll find a
sealed chest inside. Examine and don't open, then head through the center
door in the room. Keep heading north through doors and up stairs until you
reach a pair of sealed chests at the end. Repeat the process of examining
and not opening each of them. With that done, head back and leave the
building.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
We're done here. Warp to 2300 AD.

====================
~World Map; 2300 AD~
====================
Fly to the main continent, heading for Bangor Dome on the far left end.

======================
~Bangor Dome; 2300 AD~
======================
All there is to do in here is enter the Time Gate.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
A warp in the top right corner opens up by taking that gate. Head to
Guardia Forest, 1000 AD.

=========================
~Guardia Forest; 1000 AD~
=========================
This area should be familiar, but it's not accessable through simply
walking here. The sealed chest is in the top right corner. Open it up to
grab a POWER RING.

=================
~The End of Time~
=================
Back to where you came from.

======================
~Bangor Dome; 2300 AD~
======================
Leave to the world map, and hop on the Epoch. Warp to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Head north to Truce Inn. Inside, head to the second floor and open up the
sealed chest to obtain the BLUE PLATE. Now hop back in the Epoch and fly
down to the bottom left of the world map, to the village of Porre. Enter
the Mayor's Manor on the left. The pair of sealed chests have been
relocated to the upstairs bedroom. Open them to collect the BLACK PLATE and
the WHITE PLATE.

Now fly over to Guardia Castle.

=========================
~Guardia Castle; 1000 AD~
=========================
Marle has to be in the party or else you'll just be kicked out. Once you 
enter with her in your party, a scene between Marle and the Chancellor will
take place. After that, enter the King's chambers and head up the left 
hallway. After going up three flights of stairs you can open the sealed 
chest and obtain the RED PLATE. Leave the castle now.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Hop in the Epoch and fly to the bottom right continent and the village of
Choras. Head north to the Hero's Grave.

=======================
~Hero's Grave; 1000 AD~
=======================
Head up the stairs on the right and through the door in the small room.
When you appear in the larger room, enter the door on the right. Open the
sealed chest to obtain MOONBEAM ARMOR. Now enter the center door and head
all the way to the end of the ruins. You'll find two sealed chests still
here, so open them up to obtain the SUZAKU and the VALKYRIE BOW. Leave the
ruins.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Use the Epoch to fly over to Melchior's Cabin, which is left of Medina
Village if you forgot. Enter Heckran Cave behind it (the Black Omen is
blocking the entrance to the cavern, making it a little hard to find).

=======================
~Heckran Cave; 1000 AD~
=======================
Head north, under the arch, left, down two ladders, the left and down the
stairs to reach the next room. Then head down more stairs, follow the path
left to a clearing, then head south and out of the room. Proceed through
this empty room until you reach the next one. Near the end of this long
hallway is the sealed chest containing a BARRIER RING and SPEED RING. Now
trace your steps back along the linear path and leave the cavern.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
Get back in the Epoch. To the north of Medina Village you should find a
small blue pyramid. Not hard to miss. Enter it.

=======================
~Forest Ruins; 1000 AD~
=======================
Grab the MID-ETHER from the chest near the start, then walk to the blue
pyramid. The charged pendant will eliminate the barrier and two chests will
appear. A Nu appears, offering you only one of the chests.

The right chest holds the Swallow, a high powered sword for Crono. The left
chest holds the Guardian Helm, which reduces physical damage recived to 
1/3. The helm is far better to get because the Rainbow Shell quest yields 
an even stronger sword than the Swallow. But the choice is yours. Once 
you've picked your chest, the other disappears. Leave the area with your 
spoils.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
This wraps up all of the upgraded items. Let's get the downgraded items 
now. Warp back to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head to the top floor of Truce Inn and open the chest to obtain the BLUE
VEST. Now head to the bottom left corner of map to the village of Porre,
and head inside the Elder's House. Open up the pair of sealed chests on the
right side to obtain the BLACK VEST and WHITE VEST. Hop back in the Epoch
and fly over to Guardia Castle.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
Head north into the King's chambers, then head up the stairs down the left
hallway. After the third flight of stairs, open up the sealed chest to earn
the RED VEST. Leave the castle now.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Board the Epoch and fly down to the Hero's Grave on the bottom right
continent.

======================
~Hero's Grave; 600 AD~
======================
Head up the stairs on the right, through the door in the small room, and
through the door on the right in the large room you enter. Open the sealed
chest to earn the NOVA ARMOR. Now head through the center door, head north
through a lot more doors and up some stairs until you reach the end of the
ruins. Open up the final two sealed chests for the ONIMARU and SIREN'S
KISS. And with that, this sidequest is finally over.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~7G.The Rainbow Shell~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head to Choras village on the bottom right continent. Head inside the
Tavern and talk to Toma, the man on the left side of the bar. He'll hand
you Toma's Spirits, asking you to pour them on his headstone should the
worst occur while searching for the Rainbow Shell. Leave the Tavern and use
the Epoch to warp to 1000 AD.

====================
~World Map; 1000 AD~
====================
To the left of the village you can find West Cape, marked by a single
headstone on the map. Head into it and examine the headstone at the end.
You'll pour his spirits over the stone, and Toma will appear and say that
the Rainbow Shell is located in Giant's Claw to the northwest. Examine the
back side of the headstone to obtain a SPEED CAPSULE, then get back on the
Epoch and warp to 600 AD.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
Head to the large island to the right of Choras, hosting the omnious
Giant's Claw.

======================
~Giant's Claw; 600 AD~
======================
Follow the linear path to the end of the room and read Toma's note,
regarding jumping into some holes. Proceed south and into the next room.
Grab the TRICERATOPPER and MID-ETHER from the chests left and right of the
throne (is this Tyranno Lair?) and proceed south to the next room.

Head left towards a chest and a group of dinosaurs will attack you. These
are stronger version of what you've faced in the past, but they're all
still weak to Lightning magic. Grab the CLARITY CAP from the chest. Head
down the stairs on the right instead of going into the next room, and near
the far right side another group of foes will attack, these guys absorbing
Light magic.

Head north to the next room. Press the middle switch to make a save point
appear, then either the left or right switches in this room to make holes
appear. Fall into one of the holes and fight the Fossil Apes where you
land. They've got strong attacks, so take them down quickly. Press the
swith on the left to open the skull head and proceed through it. Grab the
sparkly STRENGTH CAPSULE on the ground in the small room behind the skull,
then exit the room from the south end.

Head left a bit and climb down a ladder. Follow the path right of the
ladder to another STRENGTH CAPSULE sparkling on the ground, and grab a
HI-ETHER from a chest left of the ladder. Climb back up the ladder and
proceed down the left path. Follow it around the room, killing Fossil
Apes when you encounter them, and another pair near the exit to the room. A
chest holding a BLUE GEMSTONE is north of the exit. Grab it before going to
the next room.

Head all the way to the right and climb down the south ladder, not up the
north one. Follow the linear path left and right to another ladder, but
grab a LAPIS from the chest near it before climbing down. At the bottom,
head left to the entrance to the next room. Several foes await you in the
next room. They should be easy to dispatch by now. At the north end of the
room are two skulls, but only the left is open. Head through it and up the
stairs.

Head left and press the switch on the floor to not have to fight the Fossil
Ape against the wall, then proceed through the exit on the south wall left
of the switch. A WRATH BAND is in a chest at the end of the short hallway.
Head back to the previous room and go right, press another switch to avoid
another fight, then exit through another exit on the south wall.

A pair of Rubbles are in this room, and they should be easy to kill at this
point. Head right and north into the next room. Examine the egg and you'll
fall through a trap door. You'll be in the cage Kino was trapped in a long
time ago. Exit through the bottom right, then follow the hallway left and
up the stairs. You'll be back at the room with two skulls where only the
left one was open, but now you're behind the closed one. Grab the sparkly
STRENGTH CAPSULE on the ground, then go back to the cage room. Head down
the right hallway and down the stairs at the end.

Use the save point here, then press the switch next to the cage to open it.
Enter the room at the back of the cage, then head to the back of the
hallway. Equip good Fire-blocking helms and armor, much like the Son of the
Sun fight.

BOSS-Rust Tyranno
HP-25000

Exp-3800/TP-40/G-2000

Techs:
Chomp (Absorbs HP)
Roar
Tyranno Flame (Fire Tech)

Recommended Levels-42+
----------------------------
Another really easy fight. Much like the Black Tyranno fight, he basically
just counts down from 5 to 0 and then uses Tyranno Flame, doing a crapton
of damage to your party. Of course, if you've got the Red Plate and Vests
equipped the damage is practically nullified. If you don't, you will likely
need to heal a bit after the attack. It's not a hard fight, and he does not
use Chomp all too much (although that itself does a decent amount of
damage too).
===========================================================================
After the fight, proceed to the end of the hallway to discover the
legendary Rainbow Shell. You can't lift it, so you'll get help from Guardia
Castle. Head south and you'll warp to the castle.

========================
~Guardia Castle; 600 AD~
========================
The Commander will head off to fetch the Rainbow Shell. Leave the castle
once the scene is over.

===================
~World Map; 600 AD~
===================
The Epoch will be lying outside. Warp to 1000 AD and enter the castle.

=========================
~Guardia Castle; 1000 AD~
=========================
Enter the castle and talk to a few of the guards to find out that the King
is on trial for selling a royal heirloom. Head down the right hallway and
to the end of it. There are two stairs here--take the left one to the top
floor. Put Marle in your party and talk to the guards to demand access to
the courtroom.

The Chancellor challenges you that if you want to free the King you'll need
to prove the Rainbow Shell is still in the castle. Marle suggests that the
shell may be in the basement of the castle. Head down the stairs, but note
that two of the rooms on the way down have chests in them. One is locked
and the other holds a TURBO ETHER. Back in the main room with the guards
infront of the stairs take the stairs to the right. The ones that weren't
here on your first trip in the castle long ago.

In the castle storage area, attack the Vipers blocking your way. They
shouldn't even be a challenge now. You'll get attacked by more easy foes in
the next room. After the fight, grab a TURBO ETHER, ELIXIR, and LAPIS from
the only accessable chests on the left, then keep following the path north.
Go through the linear hallway to the next area.

It's another linear hallway with more Nagas wandering around it. Avoid them
if you can to not waste too much time, then grab the ELIXIR, TURBO ETHER,
and LAPIS from the chests infront of the Rainbow Shell. Examine the shell
and you'll obtain a shard of it. With the shard in hand, the scene shifts
back to the courtroom...

Hurry and return to the top floor of the castle and talk with the guards
blocking entry to the courtroom. Make sure your team is healed before doing
this. Once you get inside the courtroom and expose the Chancellor as a
lying bastard like he was in 600 AD, you'll do what you did to him back
then--fight him. 'Course he's a lot harder now but...eh.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Yakra XIII
HP-18000
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-3500/TP-40/G-2000

Techs:                        Counters:
Miasma (Confuse)              Needle Spin Ver. XIII Barrage
Yakra Rumble
Needle Spin Ver. XIII
Needle Spin Ver. XIII Barrage

Recommended Levels-40+
----------------------------
He likes to spam Miasma, so having status immunity equipment equipped is
probably for the best. His main attacks can also hurt your team quite a
bit, especially his Needle Spin. It can do a crazy amount of damage to
someone in your party. He also rarely uses Yakra Rumble, and it does a
good amount of damage to your whole party.

Be sure that when you land the final blow your entire party has a good
amount of HP. He uses his barrage attack when killed, harming everyone in
your team. If you all die from that then the battle will have been for
naught.
===========================================================================
After a touching scene between Marle and her father, you'll be taken back
to his main chambers. Melchior will barge in, saying he wishes to make some
armor from the Rainbow Shell. Before you go to see him, head back up to the
courtroom. You probably noticed Yakra XIII drop a sparkly object after
being killed. Grab it in the courtroom to obtain Yakra's Key. Head down
two flights of stairs and open up the locked chest with that key to free
the real Chancellor.

Now, head back to the main floor and go to the basement storage room.
Without Yakra's minions flying about you should be able to reach the
Rainbow Shell rather quickly. Talk to Melchior and he'll offer to make one
Prismatic Dress or three Prismatic Helms, which are slightly weaker than
the helms but you get three of them. Getting the trio of helms is much
better as they're pretty much the best helms in the game. They prevent
against all status effects and give pretty good defense. Equip them on your
main team.

Now, if you completed the Sun Stone sidequest and talk to Melchior with it,
he'll use part of the stone and some of the Rainbow Shell to create the
Prism Spectacles, which heavily boosts damage output. He also uses it to
create the Rainbow sword for Crono, which has a 70% critical hit rate. It's
the second to best sword in the game (and the best one you're not getting
before beating Lavos).

And that's it for this sidequest. All that work for a good amount of nifty

===========================================================================
                          ~8.The Lost Sanctum~
===========================================================================
There are some sidequests that astound you with ingenuity, praise with the
great items obtained through them, and overall quality and fun they
provide. Other sidequests make you wonder what amazing drugs the game
designers were high on that could possibly make them think a particular
sidequest was good.

The Lost Sanctum is the latter.

The Lost Sanctum is nothing but a series of fetch quests. By the end of it
you will hate Spekkio's theme, loathe a particular mountain, get sick
of warping everywhere with the Epoch, wish to annihilate a particular
mountain, be annoyed at subpar rewards, and hope for medicine to alleviate
the pain a certain mountain causes.

It's that bad. But a few players have mentioned the Lost Sanctum was really
enjoyable.

Please don't listen to them. High odds say you won't enjoy it. Higher odds
say you bail on this sidequest less than an hour into it. Maybe you'll
enjoy it, maybe you won't. Let's just go with the pessimistic route. It's
better that way.

You can start this sidequest after the Black Omen rises. The way I'm
working this is I'll be doing everything one quest at a time. Several
quests can be done out of my order, but it should not ultimately matter
which order you perform them in. The only exception are the first two
quests.

Now, are you all ready for a world of pain?

For the record, both Lost Sanctums are small green vortexes on the world
map. Both of them are near the top right corners of the map in 65,000,000
BC and 600 AD. You'll remember their locations very, very soon. You'll be
visiting them a lot, after all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       ~8A.Sanctum Liberation Squad~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
~World Map; 65,000,000 BC~
==========================
Locate the Lost Sanctum as the green vortex in the top right corner of the
map on a plateau. It's hard to miss. Land the Epoch near it and head
inside.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
After falling down the pillar of light, head south into a large open
cavernous room. There's not a single person here, however. Head right to
find a save point. Now head to the far right side of the room. Climb up two
ladders and you'll get out of the cave.

===============================
~Millennia Wood; 65,000,000 BC~
===============================
Your objective here is to kill every single enemy in the area. Every last
one must be killed. Head right then north to find a group of Ogans. After
one of your party members assumes they attacked the village, you'll need to
kill them off. Remember that fire magic burns off their hammers, making
them relatively harmless.

Once they've been killed, head north, right a little, then further north to
find a clearing with a Slate Imp walking about. Engage him and all his
cronies for a battle, kill them off, collect the HI-POTION from the chest
in the far north, then head left and south. You'll have to fight another
large group of Imps and Ogans as you proceed south. You'll also encounter
another Ogan on the map as you keep heading south. Fight him and the Ogan
Chieftan reinforcement he brings in for the battle.

Once you reach the south end, you can head right a bit and walk through a
hole in the trees leading to a nook with 20,000G in a chest. After that,
head left and keep following the linear path north. Stick to the far left
side and as you head north you'll walk through a hidden passage in the
trees and end up near a chest with a HI-ETHER in it. Get out of the nook
and follow the path north. At the clearing at the end you'll face one last
large group of Ogans and Chieftans.

After the fight your partners should discuss that you killed everything in
the forest provided you actually did. Head to the top left corner, just
left of the three small bushes, then walk south through a hole in the trees
to reach a chest with an ELIXIR inside. From the sparkling part of the
ground, head north and northeast through a hole in the trees to reach a
nook with an ATHENIAN WATER in a chest.

Provided everything is killed, make your way back to the village.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Make your way to the center of the village, to the small table there. Your
team will stop to rest for a second before someone calls out to them. Turns
out this is actually a village of Reptites. Huh. They'll all thank you for
driving away the baddies in the forest, handing you the Dragon's Tear as a
reward. That accessory boosts the holders critical rate by a good amount
Very useful.

Choose to listen to the Reptites' requests. You can now talk to all of
them, some of the handing out tasks that'll be in the various quests below.
The Reptite closest to the save point holds a shop with good armor if you
haven't done any of the real sidequests. Check it out. With that, this task
is complete. That's 1/11.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    ~8B.SLS Returns to the Middle Ages~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
The location of the sanctum is almost exactly the same as in 65,000,000 BC.
Top right corner of the map. It's a bit left of where the Forest Ruins are
in 1000 AD. In any case, once you enter the cavern you'll find out the
Reptites are still here. Their descendants, at least. Agree to help them.
Your first task will be to do the exact same thing you did in 65,000,000
BC. JOY.

Same place as before. Head to the far right side of the cavern, climb the
pair of ladders (after the first ladder is a Reptite who houses an inn),
and at the top of the second ladder you'll be back in the woods.

========================
~Millennia Wood; 600 AD~
========================
Head right then north. You'll need to fight off a group of Imps in the
first clearing. Not too bad. Once killed, head north, right, then north
more to the next clearing. A lone Imp is here, so fight him and his group
of reinforcements. Once killed, grab the SHELTER from the chest at the
northernmost point, then head left and follow the path south.

Fight the Imp and his posse midway down your trek. Keep going south after
that, hugging the right trees. You'll go through a hole in the trees near
the south point, and be in a nook near where you started. Grab 25,000G from
the chest, then get out of the nook and head left then north. Fight the
Jackpot and Imps, and as you go north hug the left trees. You'll go through
a hole in them midway up the path, landing in a nook with a TURBO ETHER in
a chest.

Back on the main path, continue to the north clearing. You'll fight two
Ogans as you reach it. Head to the northwestern most point, just left of
three small bushes, and walk south through the trees to reach a chest with
a MEGALIXIR inside. Back at the clearing, go dead north through more trees
to another nook with a DRAGONHEAD, a good helm for males, in a chest.

Provided all enemies have been killed, return to the main area of the
sanctum.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Head down both ladders and the village elder will be waiting for you. You
will get a Megalixir as your reward. Not bad. You've gone through 2/11ths
of the sanctum, and those were just the intro quests! It all goes straight
to hell from here!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     ~8C.Ogans and the Golden Hammer~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom left corner and he'll ask you if you
could try finding the legendary Golden Hammer. Agree to his plight. Now,
head out the center south exit of the sanctum to an area you haven't
visited yet.

=====================================
~Great Southern Swamp; 65,000,000 BC~
=====================================
Head south and left and grab a HI-POTION from the chest. Head back a little
right then keep following the path south. Head right when you're forced to
get in a fight with a trio of Kingfrogs. Enjoy this fight; you'll be
fighting them way too many times in the future. Magic won't work against
them.

Head right, then all the way south to the bottom most edge of the forest.
Go a little right for a chest containing a SHELTER, then keep heading left.
When you get the chance, go north to find a TURBO ETHER in a chest you
couldn't access otherwise, then get back south and keep heading left. At
the bottom left corner of the swamp is a MID-POTION in a chest.

Two Kingfrogs are rolling around just north of you. Walk past them, and as
soon as you do go right. You should see a sparkly in the flower...like
things. Grab it to obtain the Golden Sand necessary for making the hammer.
With this item, return to the sanctum and follow the path up the far right
ladders to reach the woods again.

===============================
~Millennia Wood; 65,000,000 BC~
===============================
You're not forced to kill anything here anymore, so don't waste your time
if you don't feel like it. Talk to the Reptite right of the entrance to the
woods to learn about a large fallen tree, then make your way to the end of
the woods.

After getting through the forced fights, once you reach the end of the
forest examine the sparkly on the ground (you can only examine it from the
south end, apparently). Choose to sprinkle the golden sand around it. As
one of your partners suggests, get back to this exact place in the 600 AD
Lost Sanctum.

========================
~Millennia Wood; 600 AD~
========================
Of interesting note is that now Wonder Rocks will have a chance to appear
midway through the woods. It's an enemy actually on the map, rather than
jumping into a fight when another one is triggered (like it won't appear in
a fight where you bumped into an Imp on the map). It looks like a blue
Rubble, gives out 10,000 Exp, 20,000G, and 1000 TP if killed. It also gives
a Lumicite Shard if you Charm or kill it, used to get an item in the 600 AD
sanctum from the Reptite near the save point. However it often runs away
quickly so you have limited time. These guys only appear in the 600 AD
woods, not the 65,000,000 BC ones.

Once you reach the clearing at the end again, your team will notice the
golden tree is not there. A golden Ogan wielding the Golden Hammer appears,
however. And then runs off. Head back towards the Lost Sanctum, and halfway
through the forest you'll get into a fight with the Ogan. It's the south
clearing where you fight him, and if you were to hug the northern walls you
can end up passing the fight point. Try to not do that.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Goldhammer
HP-5800
Defense-220/Magic Defense-70
Exp-2000/TP-0/G-10000

Techs:                        Counters:
Gold Hammer                   Rush (Lowers HP to 1)
Boulder
Thrash

Recommended Levels-40+
----------------------------
Not a terribly hard fight. Goldhammer has pretty bulky defenses, so a lot
of your attacks won't be doing a huge amount of damage. The worst part
about the fight is that each time he gets hurt his attack power increases.
Thusly, ending the fight as quickly as possible with strong Techs, physical
or magical, is advised.

His base attacks don't do a ton of damage, but they become powerful
extremely fast if you keep hitting him with your own attacks. His Rush move
lowers the person it hits' HP to 1. He uses it when he is running low on
HP. Once he spams Rush as pretty much his only attack hurry up and finish
Goldhammer off.
===========================================================================
You'll obtain the Golden Hammer for beating the Ogan. With the hammer in
tow, leave the forest and warp to the prehistory Lost Sanctum.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the bottom left Reptite and offer to hand him to Golden Hammer. As
your reward you'll obtain 100,000G. Not bad, I suppose. That's 3/11
sidequests done. Hope you're having fun. It's about to become very, very
awful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   ~8D.The Prismastone and the Mountain~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the Reptite in the top left corner, closest to the entrance of the
sanctum. The Reptite says he needs the Prismastone to cure his ill
daughter. It lies at the top of Mount Emerald. JOY. Agree to take on his
quest, despite the warning of a guardian at the base of the mountain, and
head south and leave for the marsh.

=====================================
~Great Southern Swamp; 65,000,000 BC~
=====================================
Make your way to the bottom right corner of the swamp. Follow the path
north that is there, and right off the screen.

==============================
~Mount Emerald; 65,000,000 BC~
==============================
Player, meet Mount Emerald. Doesn't look so bad from down here, now then
does it?

YOU'RE WRONG, DEAL WITH IT.

Talk to the dark blue Nu blocking you from progressing. Yeah, you're gonna
have to fight the guy to make him move. At least he's nice about it.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Nu Guardian
HP-6100
Defense-200/Magic Defense-80
Exp-2500/TP-0/G-0

Techs:                     Counters:
Charge                     Luminaire (Light Tech)
Head-butt (Lowers to 1 HP) Dark Matter (Shadow Tech)
                           Flare (Fire Tech)
                           Ice II (Water Tech)
                           Hypnotize
                           Time Freeze

Recommended Levels-42+
----------------------------
Headbutt is the move all Nu's have, the one that knocks you to 1 HP. You
know the one. He'll counter all magic attacks with a magic counter of the
same type (although with Water he goes with Ice). If you use physical moves
he will do either Hypnotize or Time Freeze. Thusly, if you keep hitting him
with magic attacks he will never get the chance to use one of his normal
Techs.

That's for the best since Headbutt will ensure the next hit-all magic
attack he uses will murder whoever gets hit. Ice II is his weakest counter,
while Luminaire is his strongest. Avoid using light magic if you can.
Overall the fight will last awhile due to his insane defenses. There's not
much you can do about that. Just keep smacking him with magic attacks and
you'll never have to worry about Headbutt. Head whenever necessary.
===========================================================================
The Nu promises to train harder to beat you some day. Alright, let's climb
this bitch. Um, quite frankly there's nothing to guide you on. This is as
linear as it gets, folks. You can occasionally climb up or down a stray
ladder and end up at a chest, but nothing else.

...fine, but I refuse to describe how to climb this mountain again in the
future.

Head left and up the tall ladder. Head right, get into a forced fight,
kill the Jadewing (only magic moves hit it) and go right and down a ladder.
Head left from there and down a ladder to find a chest with 10,000G inside,
then head back up the ladder and proceed right across a bridge. Head south
to a chest with a SHELTER inside, then go north and up a ladder. Head
north, left across a bridge to a chest with an ELIXIR inside, then south
down a ladder. Head left, up a ladder, north and up another ladder, right
and then south across a bridge, then right and up a ladder. Climb another
ladder north of that, save at the save point, then go left across the
bridge and north to the next screen.

Halfway there! Head up the ladder then right across the bridge. Head south,
then up two ladders, left and down a ladder, then left across a bridge.
Fight a group of enemies (beetles can't be hurt by magic). Head down a
ladder left of the fight to find an AEONIAN HELM in a chest, then go back
up the ladder and north across a bridge. Go right across another bridge,
up a ladder, grab a HI-POTION from the chest, then up another ladder. Head
left across the bridge, down a ladder, all the way left to another ladder,
climb it to the top, climb another ladder, head right to a third ladder and
climb that, then head right for an AEONIAN SUIT in a chest, then all the
way left and to the next screen.

This is the summit. Stupid mountain. The game ensures this place is burned
into your skull, believe you me. Head right, to the next screen, then north
to find the Prismastone. Obtain it. Guess what? YOU'RE CLIMBING DOWN NOW.
HAVE FUN, SUCKERS.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
I think the hardest part of getting back here was not wanting to kill
yourself. I should take the time to warn you that you'll be climbing up and
down that mountain at least a dozen more times, and 18 or so times total if
you're an absolute completionist hell bent on 100%ing every last fraction
of the game.

Talk to the top left Reptite again and get your reward, a set of capsules.
It contains 2 Strength, 2 Magic, and 2 Speed. Not bad, really. That's 4/11
sidequests done. And now you see where all hell breaks loose. For the
record, you keep the stone. The Reptite only had to borrow it for like, 5
seconds. Grr.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~8E.Prismastone Paradox~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the Reptite on the far right, at the base of the ladders leading
to Millennia Wood. She'll be surprised you have a Prismastone, then say
that two Prismastones left next to each other in the village sanctuary will
merge to one fantastic stone. Agree to help make this stone.

Climb the ladders in the center of the village, then up another pair and
enter the room at the top. Place the Prismastone on one of the two
pedestals at the end of the room. Now, warp to the sanctum in 600 AD.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Climb the ladders that lead to the sanctuary. You'll find the village elder
at the top, and he says that you can't enter the sanctuary until you prove
yourself and get the sacred Reptmark. It's in the Millennia Wood. Things
just can't be easy in these sidequests...

========================
~Millennia Wood; 600 AD~
========================
Head all the way to the end of the woods. At the top left corner of the
clearing you'll find three small bushes. To the left of them is a large
sparkly object. Pick it up to obtain the Reptmark. Return to the sanctum.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Head up to the sanctuary and show the mark to the elder. He'll let you
through. Take the Prismastone from its pedestal. Return to the other
sanctum now.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Head up to the sanctuary and place the Prismastone you got from the future
on the pedestal next to the current Prismastone. They will fuse together to
make the Saintstone. Head back to the Reptite on the far right, next to the
ladders leading to Millennia Wood, and for showing him the stone you will
receive the Dragon Arm. Good weapon for Robo. 5/11 quests done. This wasn't
a bad one, I'd say.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       ~8F.Finding the Nu Once Again~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom left corner. He says a lonely figure
rests at the bottom of the mountain, and asks you to check on him. Agree to
check on the figure. Well, I think you know the way to the mountain. South
to the swamp, access to it is in the bottom right corner. A chest
containing a SHELTER rests just before the entrance to the mountain.

=====================
~Mount Anger; 600 AD~
=====================
Talk with the same Nu you fought back in prehistory. He wants to fight you.
Naturally he chooses for you to do it at the top of the mountain. Have fun.
On your way up you can collect 30,000G and a LAPIS (south of the Jadewing
you don't have to fight). Climb to the top of the mountain.

What's that? The damn ladder is broken? Son of a--, well, make your way
back to the sanctum.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom right corner. He mentions that you need
sturdy vines to make a good ladder. They're available in the southern
swamp.

========================
~Southern Glade; 600 AD~
========================
Head to the southern point of the glade and head left. When you can go
north you can find a chest containing a LAPIS, then head all the way left
to find an ELIXIR in a chets, then go right and north. Fight the group of
enemies, head north and left to a chest with an ATHENIAN WATER inside.

With most of the items in the glade obtained, head to the top right corner
of the glade. In the clearing you can find a large sparkly object at the
north of the clearing, which is the Sturdy Vines. The bottom left corner of
this clearing holds 50,000G in a chest. Now, off to Mount Emerald again.

========================
~Mount Crapsink; 600 AD~
========================
Head back to the broken ladder and your team will realize they can't do
shit about it here. Yes, the game forces you to make your team point out
the obvious before you can fix the ladder. Damn them. Well, now you know to
go to the same spot in prehistory. Joyous.

===========================
~Mount Hell; 65,000,000 BC~
===========================
Climb the top of the ladder that breaks in 600 AD and your team will lower
the sturdy vines to create a second ladder. With this wonderful waste of
time now complete, get back on the same mountain, same place, in the
future.

==================================
~Mount Pain and Suffering; 600 AD~
==================================
Climb the mountain to the point where the ladder had broken. Your handmade
ladder is still standing, so climb it. In the first area of the mountain
you can collect an ATHENIAN WATER from a chest, save and heal at the save
point near the top of this area, then go left to the next area.

You can collect, in order of appearance, a RAINBOW HELM, TURBO ETHER, and a
MERMAID HELM as you climb this section of the mountain. Personally I think
it's better than the 65,000,000 BC Mount Emerald but that's just me. More
linear, too.

Once you reach the top you'll face the Nu who has trained for millennia
to fight you once more.
===========================================================================
BOSS-Nu Master
HP-8800
Defense-185/Magic Defense-70
Exp-3800/TP-0/G-0

Magic:
Absorbs Shadow

Techs:                       Counters:
Devil's Drop (Halves HP)     Drain Health (Absorbs HP)
Thunderburst (Light Tech)
Life Shaver (Sets HP to 1)
Death's Rainbow (Insta-kill)
Telekinesis
Overdrive

Recommended Levels-45+
----------------------------
The Nu Master is one hellishly annoying fight. Death's Rainbow, as you can
see, is an insta kill attack. He usually doesn't use it often. Usually.
Sometimes he does, sometimes you may never see it. Hope it's the latter.
You'll constantly be losing health as he'll counter moves with Drain
Health.

Robo is good for this battle and his Heal Beam. Devil's Drop is an annoying
to deal with attack, but it can be healed. He still has the "drop HP to 1"
attack. He uses that often from what I've seen. Telekinesis is crazy weak,
and I'm unsure what Overdrive does. Never seen him use it. It probably
raises his attack power or just does moderate damage to everyone. Stay
healed and you'll do fine.
===========================================================================
The Nu will agree to be your friend now. If you need help with a task in
the future, he's the...thing...to call. Okay. Well, climb down the
mountain now. Joy.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom left corner again. For befriending the
Nu, you'll obtain the Nova Armor. That's 6/11 of the quests. Please stop
for awhile and do something fun. Don't go insane from this sidequest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~8G.The Bridge Builder~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite closest to the ladders leading to Millennia Wood. He
asks that you help him collect the tools needed to create a large bridge.
He needs lumber, metal, and a hammer. Agree to help him out, then head
south to the glade.

========================
~Southern Glade; 600 AD~
========================
Get through several forced fights as you make your way to the top left
corner of the glade. You can head off screen to the left once there and to
an area you have yet to visit.

=========================
~Winding Passage; 600 AD~
=========================
Head through the passage and you'll get into a fight with some Black Bats.
Use magic on them, then after the fight walk right and through the wall to
reach the nook with a chest in it containing a LAPIS. Head back through the
wall and continue left. After the Rebels, head left then south as soon as
you can. Walk left through the wall here to reach the hidden nook you can
see, holding a TURBO ETHER in a chest.

Get back out of the nook and head left and north. Ignore the enemies and
don't go through the doorway. Head right at the end, through a hole in the
wall to end up at a chest with the Steel Ingot inside. With the first of
three items obtained, head to Millennia Wood in prehistory.

===============================
~Millennia Wood; 65,000,000 BC~
===============================
Head right from the entrance and talk to the Reptite. He says he'll hand
you some lumber from a tree that had fallen long ago. After obtaining the
Godwood, head back to the sanctum.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the bottom left Reptite. He's not using the hammer so you'll borrow
it from him. Once you have the Golden Hammer, head back to 600 AD.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite near the ladders leading to the forest again and he'll
thank you for collecting all of the bridge parts by giving you the Haste
Helm. Not terribly bad for not needing to go to that mountain in this
quest. That's 7/11 done. We're closer to finishing now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ~8H.Obtaining the Waystone~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the Reptite near the ladders leading to Millennia Wood. It's the
second one on the left from the ladder, or just right of the ladders
leading to the sanctuary. He says the Prismastone is good at absorbing
light. And we could use it for something if we leave atop of...oh god no...

===============================
~Mount Dog Crap; 65,000,000 BC~
===============================
With the Saintstone still in your possession, head to the mountain and
climb the hell out of it. You know this stuff is fun. Once you reach the
summit, head right and to the point where you first found the Prismastone.
Examine the spot and place the Saintstone where it used to be. Once it's in
place, climb right back down this damned mountain. Guess where you're
going?

===================================
~You'll Climb this in Hell; 600 AD~
===================================
You'd think the mountain would change, ya know, a bit more in 65,000,600
years. You'd think. Seriously, it's TOO identical. The only real difference
is the locations of the forced fights (and the other enemies that are
wandering around not in forced fights, but there's no chance you're wasting
your sanity doing that, yes?), and I think a few bridges and ladders.
Honestly I haven't really paid attention to the locations of the ladders
between the two eras since I don't give two Arby french dips about this
mountain. Seriously, what the hell were they thinking. Did they think this
would be remotely fun? At all? Really? I mean, if you're reading this
paragraph (the actual guide continues below, this is but a wall of text
rant) then I can only imagine you're doing it to stump off the horrific
thoughts running through your mind as you climb this mountain again. And
you know what? I'll spoil it for you: you're going to climb up it again
later. But this is the last time in this quest. The next one doesn't touch
this mountain, but it has a dungeon so...but back to my rant. What the hell
Square. I thought you guys made good games. Way to destroy any good
thoughts I had on you guys.

Collect the Waystone at the summit and get back to the sanctum.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom right corner. He'll notice the Waystone
and ask you to check out the darkend cave beyond the southern swamp. Agree
to explore the cave.

=====================================
~Great Southern Swamp; 65,000,000 BC~
=====================================
Follow the path around to the top left corner, then head left off the
screen to the next area.

================================
~Winding Passage; 65,000,000 BC~
================================
Head to the far left side of the cave, fighting some foes along the way,
kill the Black Bat and Deathcreeper guarding the doorway on the far left
and enter it.

==============================
~Lightless Cave 65,000,000 BC~
==============================
The cave will light up with the Waystone you have, so climb up the stairs
that are ahead of you.

==================================
~Primeval Fortress; 65,000,000 BC~
==================================
Huh. What's this doing here? Head up the passage and you'll hear several
enemies approach. You'll hear that they want to take down the Lost Sanctum.
I've got no problem with that. Sadly your party does so you'll have to kill
these easy foes. You'll warp back to the village after this.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Aww, your party is so nice they'll agree to help this village without your
consent. Isn't that great?

At least Magus gets a Judgment Scythe for all the crap this part of the
quest has put us through. Also, talk to the Reptite next to the save point
to get a Megalixir from him. Nice. That's 8/11 quests, and we're in the
home stretch now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~8I.The Primeval Fortress~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
You've auto-agreed to this sidequest. Your objective is naturally return
to the fortress you left earlier in an attempt to stop the invasion force
from reaching the village (if only you could let them). Return to the
southern marsh and to the Winding Passage through the entrance in the top
left corner.

================================
~Winding Passage; 65,000,000 BC~
================================
You'll find the enemy has moved far from the fortress quickly. Use magic to
off the Chrysosaur (Light Techs heal it, though) and Black Bats you face.
Physical attacks also work too. Proceed through the cave and face another
Group of the baddies. Once you reach the far left side of the cave, head
through the doorway to be back in the fortress.

==================================
~Primeval Fortress; 65,000,000 BC~
==================================
Head up the stairs and open both chests infront of the skull for 20,000G
and another 20,000G. With the cash in hand, go through the skull. Open
another pair of egg chest in the next room for a SHELTER and ATHENIAN
WATER. Head right then up the stairs.

Follow the path south and left. Fight the pair of Chrysosaurs, then head
down the left path. Go down the stairs at the end and you'll appear in a
room with five chests, containing a FANG, HORN, FEATHER, PETAL, and the
TURBOSHOT for Lucca. It sucks hard if you got the Wondershot from the Sun
Stone sidequest.

Head up the stairs in the top right corner of the room. Head down the
passageway and fight off the enemies you encounter, then head through to
the next room at the south end. You'll be back in the area you were before,
the one where you chose to go left instead of north. If you went north you
would have appeared at this skull and two staircases. Now choose to head up
either staircase.

They both go to the same room. Walk to the middle of the room and you'll
find three doors on the north wall. If you go through the left door, you'll
find a ton of enemies guarding a single chest. Once defeated, open it for a
MEGALIXIR, then continue up the path north. Head right and south to a dead
end and a chest containing DRAGON ARMOR. Head all the way back to the room
with the three doors.

This time choose to enter the far right door. You will find enemies
guarding opened cages. After the fight, enter the right one and open the
chest for 10G, and go to the left cage and chest for a POTION and PANACEA.
Back to the previous room.

Now go through the center door. Head up the stairs to reach a large open
area. There's a save point at the north wall, so heal up at it. Head down
the left path and go south and out the exit at the end. You'll be outside,
so follow the path south and you'll fight a trio of Pterranyxs. Don't use
physical attacks against these guys as they'll counter them with a hit-all
poisoning attack. Not fun. Once killed, go to the dead end at the south end
and grab the STARDUST BOW from the chest. Return to the save point and
follow the path right and south, and also outside.

Head south like before, then left at the end to be attacked by those
annoying foes. Once killed, follow the path north and into the next room.
Kill the foes if you wish, then go north and up the stairs at the end.
Fight the large group of Twinsnakes if you wish on the next floor, then
head up the stairs in the top right corner. There's nothing in the next
room so head up the stairs once more.

Chrysosaurs are in this room. Kill if you wish, then go up the stairs once
again. You'll be outside, and you can expect all those enemies around you
to fight you head south and right (and they do). After everything has been
brutally killed, continue down the path to the right. Grab the REPTITE
DRESS from the chest, then go back to the previous room. In the room with
the Chrysosaurs there's an exit to the south. Head south and left in the
next room to find a save point. Save and use a Shelter, then head left
through the door.

Recommended Levels-47+
----------------------------
Get out a pad of paper because this is one annoying fight. The trick to
this fight is that when one of the Archaeofangs is killed, its partner
will revive it to full health. To win the fight you'll need to kill them
both before one can revitalize the other. This can be done by killing them
both with one attack, or by killing one then killing the other in one or
two moves (after that the remaining Archaeofang will have had time to use
Revive).

If you obtained the Blue Plate and Vest from the Sealed Chest sidequest,
they could be put to use here as those annoying Water Techs the Younger
has will be harmless. Now, the point of that pad of paper is to keep track
of how much damage you've done to each Archaeofang. First use the strongest
hit-all attack in your party. Let's say that attack does 1200 damage (for
simplicity's sake round damage to the nearest hundred).

Once you've dealt about 7000 damage to the elder and 6500 damage to the
Younger, bust out that 1200 damage hit-all attack to kill both foes at the
same time. That's the goal. You don't want the fight to stall out when they
use Soul Link.

Keep in mind that the Elder is the red one, and the Younger is the blue
one. As for their attacks, they aren't *terribly* powerful. They do about
100 damage each, but they use them constantly since there's two of them.
Also, they'll counter every attack with Osmose. The best way to lower their
HP quickly is to abuse their magic weaknesses. A strong magic Tech matching
their weakness can do close to 2000 damage. Kill them both off at the same
time, or one or two moves after one dies, and you should win the fight.
===========================================================================
Once these guys have been defeated, you'll return to the village.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
You will obtain the Valor Crest as a reward for all that work. Not a
terribly good accessory. Boosts critical hate rate, but not as much as
Dragon's Tear from what I can tell.

...can we still burn down this village? I know that's 9/11 sidequests and
we're really close to finishing but...please? Just a little?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     ~8J.Checking on the Bridge Worker~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite just right of the stairs leading to the sanctuary. He
will be concerned that his friend that went to work on the bridge has yet
to return. Agree to check on the bridge builder. Guess what awesome
mountain YOU'RE climbing up now?

===============================
~Mount Gun to the Head; 600 AD~
===============================
If you somehow make your way to the summit, talk to the Nu Master. He'll
move aside and let you pass to the left, where the bridge builder is
working. Head left, through the short cavern and outside to the bridge. You
will save the worker from falling off the bridge, and he'll exclaim that
he's exhausted from working.

Go back through the cave and talk to the Nu. He'll agree to help the
worker. Go back through the cave and after the scene the Nu will stop
working due to hunger. Now you're tasked with feeding him. Climb down the
god forsaken mountain.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Talk to the Reptite in the bottom left corner. You remember, the one who
wanted to be friends with the Nu. He'll hand you the Hearty Lunch to feed
the Nu with. You'll warp back to the top of the mountain now.



Just kidding, you're climbing this bitch once again.

========================
~WHY DAMMIT WHY; 600 AD~
========================
Talk to the Reptite back at the top of the mountain to hand him the Hearty
Lunch. Sadly, this isn't enough to fill the Nu to make him finish the
bridge. Instead he requests a "sweet yellow thing" that a monster had a
long time ago.

Dammit dammit dammit.

=============================
~Lost Sanctum; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
Okay! There are a total of five foods you can obtain in prehistory. However
the Nu is requesting the sweet, yellow item. Here's where you can find each
item:
Smoked Meat--Winding Passage, defeat the Deathcreeper on the far left
Dried Mushroom--Mount Emerald, defeat Exile midway up the second half of
the mountain
Sweet Banana--Great Southern Swamp, defeat enemies in the top right corner
(forced fight, enemy isn't on the map, just walk to the chest there and
you'll trigger the fight)
Millennia Fruit--Millennia Wood, defeat the Slate Imp at top right corner
Songbird Egg--Mount Emerald, defeat Hercules Beetle at the summit

This is how it works. Fight the enemy, and the reinforcements they call, at
the location given for the food you want. After the battle, your party will
notice a sparkling object on the ground. They'll pick it up and obtain the
food. For example, if you wanted a Songbird Egg you'd climb Mount Emerald
and fight the Hercules Beetle there. After the fight your party will
collect the egg.

If it's not insanely obvious given the five choices, the Sweet Banana is
what the Nu is requesting. These items are usable in battle, and if you
waste/sell it you'll need to fight the particular enemy again to get
another one. Also, these items appear in the Item Encylopedia in the Extras
section of the title screen. If you're going for 100%ing that encyclopedia
you will have to obtain all five pieces of fruit, because when you finish
this quest you can't get that food again until you restart the Lost
Sanctum in a New Game + and work your way to this quest.

And you won't want to do that. I ensure it. If you just want to do the
sidequest, get the Sweet Banana (a simple enough task) and head back to the
summit in 600 AD.

==========================
~Mount Acceptance; 600 AD~
==========================
Climb this glorious mountain once more. At the top, head back to the Nu
Master and feed him the Sweet Banana. The Nu will complete the bridge, and
you'll warp back to the sanctum.

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Awww, wasn't that nice scene worth all that effort? I think it was. The
Saurian Leathers is your real reward for all of this. Really good armor.
That's 10/11 quest. Just one more to go! Don't quit now, you're just that
close to being completely finished! Also, the Nu Master has set up a shop
in the bottom left corner, so check it out if you want some Turbo Ethers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  ~8K.Climbing the Tower of the Ancients~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
Head back to the middle of the sanctum after the ending of the previous
quest. A Reptite will run in after getting scared of an eerie tower across
the bridge that was just built. The Elder will explain that the tower was
made to pay tribute to the protectors of the village long ago. Since
something is amiss, you are charged with the final task of investigating
what is wrong.

=======================
~Mount Emerald; 600 AD~
=======================
Hum dee dee doo! This is our final trek up the mountain! Savor in every
last step you make because you're never climbing this ardous mountain ever
again. Once you reach the summit, head left through the cave. Head left
across the bridge and defeat all three groups of foes that ambush you on
the way over. When you reach the castle on the other side, head in.

===============================
~Tower of the Ancients; 600 AD~
===============================
Head north to the save point, then up the stairs. Grab the DINOBLADE and
50,000G from the chests, fight the enemies, then head north and up the
stairs there. Head through the empty room and up to the next floor. Fight
the Exile if you wish, then head left and south to the next room.

Fight the Soul Stalkers and his comrades in the next room if you want to,
then use the stairs in the top right corner to reach the next floor. Fight
foes here as well if you want, then head to the bottom left exit.

In this large room head right to find a save point. Heal up, then head left
and south. You'll have to do pretty much the same thing you've just been
doing--climbing through a bunch of rooms, almost all of them having enemies
you can choose to fight or avoid.

Once you reach the near-highest floor, you can go north up more stairs or
down the red carpet to the right. Kill the enemies that get in your way and
open the chest at the end of the path to obtain the RUSTED BLADE. Now head
up the stairs. You'll have to repeat the "climbing up a bunch of stairs
tactic", but this time there's a bunch of forced fights. Ugh. At least it's
not as bad as Mount Emerald or anything.

At the top you'll find a save point. Heal once again and save, then head up
one last set of stairs. Step into the center of the large room.

Bladesman Techs:
Sword Strike
Blade Dance
Desprate Strike
First Aid (Restores HP)

Recommended Levels-47+
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. Master at Arms is very sturdy with those
defenses, so focus primarily on the Bladesman. He has low HP and defenses
so he shouldn't take a ton of effort to kill quickly. Try to avoid hit-all
attacks because Master-at-Arms will counter every attack with Tsubame
Gaeshi, which isn't too powerful but damage dealt can stack up fast.

Use just physical attacks against the Bladesman as they deal a lot more
damage than magic moves. After a few powerful Techs he'll fall and you'll
just be left with Master-at-Arms. Like the Bladesman, use just physical
Techs against him. That high magic defense, and an immunity to Light magic,
makes it hard to deal damage to him otherwise.

His attacks overall aren't terribly hard to handle. He will boost his
attack power occasionally with his stance, or do the opposite and raise
defense. Flash of Steel is his counter in the defensive stance, and it does
a lot more damage than Tsubame Gaeshi. Keep healing and you'll have no
problem slowly whittling down his HP.
===========================================================================
Once they've been killed, enter the doorway in the top right corner. You'll
find the idols inside. Interesting. Wasn't THAT worth the entire sidequest?
It's not? Really? Well, at least you don't have to climb down the mountain
again...

======================
~Lost Sanctum; 600 AD~
======================
That's 11/11 sidequests, and as a final reward you obtain the Champion's
Badge. It's a Frog-only accessory that heavily boosts Masamune critical hit
ratio and halves his MP costs.

But as a better reward the Nu Master is selling Megalixirs at his shop!
50,000 G a piece though...but still, best healing item in the game. And
you're finally finished. Good job.

If you got the Rusted Blade from the Tower of the Ancients, give it to the
Reptite closest to the save point in 65,000,000 BC. He'll forge it into the
Icewyrm. Not as good as the Rainbow if you got that from the Rainbow Shell
sidequest.

===========================================================================
                            ~9.The Black Omen~
===========================================================================
Once you've destroyed the Blackbird in 12,000 BC, the Ocean Palace will
rise from the ocean, becoming the Black Omen. This monstrosity of a
dungeon appears in all time eras, excluding 65,000,000 BC for obvious
reasons. You can enter it in any era you wish, except for 2300 AD because
Lavos has already destroyed the world at that point.

The Black Omen is an absurdly long dungeon, featuring minimal save points,
tons of strong foes, and lots of good items hidden within its depths. Don't
try going paradoxial on this place--defeating one time only mini-bosses
and collecting the chests in 1000 AD and going through the 600 AD Black
Omen won't make the chests stay with their contents. You can only collect
them once. The only reason to go through it in all three eras (in reverse
order) you can charm Prismatic Helms from the near-last boss at the end.

Let's roll. The era you choose is irrelevant if you don't care about the
Prismatic Helms from the final boss. To enter the omen, fly to it with the
Epoch. Once "Black Omen" appears when you fly under it, you can enter.

============
~Black Omen~
============
Once you land on deck, notice the sparkly object just south of you. Examine
that if you wish to hop back on the Epoch and leave. Be warned--this place
is extremely long. You better have a ton of MP restoring items if you want
to get through the entire palace.

Head north and you'll be attacked by six Laser Guards mounted on the wall.
Blast away all of these simple foes, then head through the door to the
north. Once inside the shnazzy place, Queen Zeal will taunt you that your
efforts in this place are futile. Although she won't leave you without a
parting gift.

Recommended Levels-40+
----------------------------
Not a terribly hard boss. It should only take a few strong hit-all attacks
and both parts of the body will fall. If you've got status immunity armor
then only Tentacle (Strike) will be the remotely annoying attacks, and
even then they won't do a ton of damage. Hell, three strong hit-all magic
Techs should be enough to destroy everything without him getting a single
attack in. Pretty pathetic fight, really.
===========================================================================
With this guy out of the way, proceed north. You'll encounter a pair of
Shieldsman. They are exactly like those foes in the Guardia Prison towers.
Wait until they move their masks and their eyes are visible, then attack
them. It'll easily do more than enough damage to kill them off. When these
chumps are out of the way, head north and right to the next room.

Fight the pair of Martellos as soon as you enter. After that, head north.
You will encounter two Fangbeasts. These guys are annoyingly powerful, and
have an attack that will halve your HP. Very, very annoying. Off them as
quickly as you can. They absorb all magic attacks, so you'll have to stick
with weak physical attacks to kill them. They truly suck.

Once dead keep going north to fight another Martello and a pair of
Synchrites. They don't have very powerful attacks, fortunately. After the
fight you can head right to a save point. You better use it since you won't
be seeing another one for quite a long time.

Head north to the next room after this. You will fight a pair of Panels
in this room. You can Charm both of them for a Speed Capsule, and you damn
well should. Once killed, proceed north and fight another pair of Panels.
Wow, four easy Speed Capsules with minimal effort. That's sweet. After the
fights, proceed north to the next room.

Defeat the Watcher and Nomads in this room. They act like Rubbles, using
Omnilock on you, but they don't give out insane Exp, but they do give out
200 TP total if everything is killed. They too run away after a few turns,
so you better get lucky in killing them. Continue north and you will have
to fight another Watcher. Head north after this and you'll fight a third
Watcher. Once the battle ends, head left to the next room.

Fight the Metal Mutants up ahead. They've got some annoying attacks, but a
few magic Techs can take these guys down. Keep going north to fight another
pair of Metal Mutants and a pair of Flyclops. A single Falcon Strike
should do the trick. Continue to the next room. There's a lone teleporter
in here, so enter it to be transported to another area of the palace. Leave
the room to the south.

This elevator should look familiar. Examine the large sparkly on the left
to make the elevator go down. You will fight a pair of Cybots on the way
down, then a group of four Hydracondas. You can Charm each one of these
guys to grab a Megalixir. You should definitely do that. The elevator
reaches the bottom after this, so head north to the next room.

As soon as you enter you'll battle a Watcher. After that, head left to a
dead end fight the pair of Hydracondas that appear (walk around the area
until you trigger the fight). After the fight, head right and north to
fight yet another Watcher. Then go north, follow the path left, then north
and right. Ignore the stairs and head all the way right and get the
MEGALIXIR from the chest, then go up the stairs. In the center of this area
you'll get into a fight with a few foes. Kill them, then on the left wall
of the room is a chest with 30,000G, then head north to the next room.

You can head either left or right as soon as you enter this room. If you
go left you'll fight two Hydracondas. If you go right, you'll attack two
Flyclops. After the fights, proceed north and fight a Watcher. You'll be at
a split path again. You'll fight a Synchrite and Martello if you follow the
path left. If you go right, you can get a MAGIC CREST from a chest, and you
will fight the same enemies. Head north to the next room.

Open the two chests here for an ELIXIR and a VIGLILANT'S HAT. Head north to
find two more chests with a NOVA ARMOR and a MEGALIXIR inside. Don't forget
to save and heal at the save point between these two chests. Once you're
rested up, head north to find two Nu's next to two chests which hold
another MEGALIXIR and a HASTE HELM. Wow, good stuff there. Talk to the left
Nu and he'll show you his shop, which has good healing items for HP and MP.
Talk to the right Nu if you wish to be transported out of the Black Omen.
Once reached, head through the north door (it's part of the wall, examine 
it to make the doorway appear).

In the next room, follow the path all the way to the left end. A Blubber
Hulk will appear out of the white swirling thing on the ground. Charm these
suckers for a Strength Capsule, then bash the hell out of it. It has really
strong attacks and counterattacks, so end the fight fast. Enter the doorway
to the north.

Fight the pair of Cybots when you enter, then head north and fight three
Shieldsman. Head north, up some stairs, and to the north end of the room
where Hydracandas seem to keep spawning. Charm away a quad set of
Megalixirs and kill them with ease. Grab the chest in the top left corner
for a ZODIAC CAPE, then head through the door on the right to the next
room.

Head right and fight a Watcher. Continue right and you'll fight a pair of
Fangbeasts and a Flyclops. Ugh. An annoying fight, but you'll pull through
it with some endurance. Grab the chest in the top right corner for a
MEGALIXIR, then head down the stairs to the right and fight a pair of
Watchers. You probably won't be able to finish this fight before they run
away, but who knows. Proceed south to the next room.

Proceed south and left at the split to reach a chest with a POWER CREST
inside. Walk right and follow the path south and some Flyclops' will appear
from the water...lava...thing. Head south and you'll fight them and a
Blubber Hulk. Continue south to a fight with a Cybot and Martello. Once
killed, grab the chest in the bottom right corner for a SPEED CAPSULE, then
go through the bottom left doorway to the next room.

Head all the way to the left and open the chest for a SPEED CAPSULE, then
go back a little right and through the doorway. Proceed to the top of the
pedestal and you'll be teleported to another area of the palace. Head north
to the next area.

Head north in this room, then left at the first chance. Go south and you'll
be attacked by a pair of Ghaj's and Narbles. Kill them all quickly as they
can do a good amount of damage to your party. Once killed, head left and
then south to find a chest at the dead end holding an ELIXIR. Head north
and right up some stairs at the end. Fight the Watcher if you want (examine
the sleeping Nomads), then go down the stairs to the right. Head north,
then left and grab the chest for a SPEED CAPSULE. Then go north and fight
another pair of Ghaj's. Once dead, go left and south. Grab the chest for a
MEGALIXIR, then head left and north to the next room.

Heal and save at the save point, then go north. After the pretty light show
it's boss time.

Use just magic attacks against these guys. Obviously with Defense like that
your regular attacks aren't going to get you very far. All of its attacks
are insanely weak. You really shouldn't have a ton of trouble with this
guy. Just be sure to heal if Life Shaver gets used by the Lower Body. The
lower half should be killed off quickly, making that an unlikely-to-see
attack, but you never know.
===========================================================================
Go back and save if you want, then head north to the next room. Use the
teleporter in here to shift to another area of the palace. Leave the room
to the south. You'll be on another elevator. Examine the sparkly thing on
the right to make it move up. You'll fight a pair of Cybots on the way up.
At the top, go through the doorway to the north.

Go north and you'll fight two Synchrites. After the fight, head left and
follow the path north. When you have to go right, look closely at the
screen to see two bats moving infront of you. Try to avoid touching them
otherwise you have to fight a pair of Fangbeasts. Damn these guys suck.
Once you kill or avoid them, head right and north. You'll fight a pair of
Blubber Hulks at the north end. After killing them, head left, north, then
right and through the door on the north wall.

You'll fight four Panels when you enter this room. Charm the Speed Capsules
from them, then kill them. Grab the chest on the left for a SPEED CAPSULE.
A save point will have appeared after defeating the Panels, so use it.
Head up the path on the right to the final mini-boss of the Black Omen.

Recommended Levels-46+
----------------------------
Now this fight is actually annoying. It's practically impossible to kill
the Lower Body. Good job if you do. All you need to do is kill the Upper
Body. Don't use any hit-all attacks as the Lower Body will stuff the
attacker's HP down to 1. That's not good given the Upper Body's large array
of moves.

However, magic Triple Techs are effective, like Twister. Although it'll
feed off of the Lower Body to restore some health, spamming such a move
will kill the Upper Body after a few turns. It's a good last resort if
nothing else is doing more than 100 damage. The Lower Body doesn't counter
the Triple Tech, luckily.
===========================================================================
Grab the two chests on the side of the room for a WHITE GEMSTONE and a
MEGALIXIR (jeez, this place is just full of the things). Head through the
north door. Head north through the simple hallway, and through the door at
the end. Boss time in the next room. Sorta. The Elder Lavos Spawn is just
like the regular Lavos Spawns, except it has more HP. Don't attack the
shell at all unless you want to be hit by a powerful counterattack. Just
whittle away at the head's 10000 HP and you'll defeat it with ease.

Head north to the next room. You'll fight the five Panels on the wall. Once
they are killed you can go through the door on the north wall. Be sure to
save and definitely heal at the save point that appears before going in.
This is the last chance to save, as the pre-final boss is coming up.
Proceed to the end of the final room. Time to get payback on this woman for
all the crap she's done.

----------------------------
Yeah this fight isn't terribly difficult. Just slam on her with everything
you've got. Her attacks are pathetically weak, except for the near OHKO
Halation move. Oh, best part about that move is that it affects your entire
damn party. Well, that's what charming 30 or so Megalixirs was for. Better
put those suckers to good use. Alternatively, this perfectly sets up Ayla's
Dino Tail and Frog's Frog Squish, Techs that deal more damage the lower 
Ayla and Frog's HP is respectively. Use those attacks before healing if 
either of them are in your party. Robo's Heal Beam also works in getting
everyone to safe HP. As long as everyone has 200+ you should be fine.
===========================================================================
You'll be thrown right into the next battle without having a chance to
heal.

Techs:
Stand Still
Turn Attack into Defense
Turn Magic into Attack
Point Flare (Fire Tech)
Energy Discharge

Recommended Levels-50+
----------------------------
Okay, this is an odd fight. Each time you hit the Mammon Machine with a
physical attack, it will increase its Defense. Each time it is hit with a
magic attack, it will increase its Attack power. Eventually it will
discharge this energy with Energy Discharge, doing a considerable amount of
damage to your party.

You're better off using powerful magic attacks. Each time it turns magic
into Attack power, that uses up an attack. It'll not use Stand Still or
Point Flare if you make it convert energy. Basically, you keep attacking
the Mammon Machine and Energy Discharge is pretty much the only thing that
will ever hit you. It stops converting energy after awhile, so keep going
all out on the machine after that, healing when necessary. Its attacks are
also considerable weak. You shouldn't need to heal often.

Recommended Levels-50+
----------------------------
Wow, this is the real Queen Zeal? Hmm. The Face is the one you're trying to
kill. Don't you dare attack either of the hands. However, you should Charm
both of the hands to get a Prismatic Helm and Dress. They're pretty much
the best defensive equipment for males and females respectively. Get Ayla 
to do it now.

Once you're charmed the items, go all out with non-hit-all Techs against
the Face. As long as you don't ever attack the hands, their lone attacks
will never do considerable damage to your team. Hell, they probably won't
even do more than 20 damage.

Overall it's a simple fight. Besides the typical Halation, none of Queen
Zeal's attacks are particularly threatening.
===========================================================================
Once victory is yours, you will jump right into the Boss Rush form of Lavos
and will fight him from there. There's a save point and warp back to the
End of Time after you beat his Shell form. Look to either the Bosses
section or section 25 of the walkthrough where I describe how to beat
Lavos. As a note, if you've already beaten his Shell from using the bucket
in the End of Time, you won't have to fight it here.

And that concludes the Black Omen. Do it again in past eras if you want to
charm more Prismatic stuff from Queen Zeal.

===========================================================================
                         ~10.Dimensional Vortex~
===========================================================================
After defeating Lavos for the first time in your file, three purple
vortexes will appear in 12,000 BC, 1000 AD, and 2300 AD. These are the
Dimensional Vortexes, a cornucopia of areas you have previously visited in
your journey, as well as a few new areas.

Basically, how it works is simple. You enter the vortex and you will have
to go through five areas you have previously visited, although there will
be one or two new areas thrown in there. At the end you'll have the choice
of returning to the world map, or continuing to an all new area. If you
clear the all new area, you'll get the choice again to either return to
the world map, or fight a boss to clear the vortex.

While running through the previously visited areas you'll have to fight the
same foes that inhabit that area. At your levels post-Lavos they probably
won't be a challenge. Your objective is that you'll start at one area of a
room, and you need to make your way to the other end of the room to proceed
to the next area of the vortex. The order of areas you visit is random, to
an extent.

There are eight orders of the five places you visit. The order that gets
chosen is completely random. I'll describe how to get through each area,
but keep in mind it's just a single room. It's generally insanely linear.

Also, the Dimensional Vortexes hold the ultimate weapons for every
character except Ayla. It's an even better incentive to go through all of
them. There's also some other awesome gear you can find, so you should have
no reason to not go through this place. Also, this is how you obtain
Ending 13.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ~10A.12,000 BC Vortex~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The location of the vortex is to the right of the Surviving Village huts.
You need to get defeated by Lavos in order to reach this point in the story
where pretty much only this island remains with the vortex.

This is the easiest of the vortexes. Courtesy of Reptobismol, here are the
eight orders of rooms you can encounter in this vortex:
1: Guardia Forest > Strath > Dactyl Nest > Site 16 > Manolia Cathedral
2: Manolia Cathedral > Site 16 > Sunken Desert > Strath > Mountain of Woe
3: Dactyl Nest > Mountain of Woe > Manolia Cathedral > Guardia Forest >
Site 16
4: Sunken Desert > Guardia Forest > Site 16 > Dactyl Nest > Fiendlord's
Keep
5:Strath > Manolia Cathedral > Fiendlord's Keep > Mountain of Woe > Guardia
Forest
6: Site 16 > Fiendlord's Keep > Mountain of Woe > Sunken Desert > Strath
7: Fiendlord's Keep > Sunken Desert > Strath > Manolia Cathedral > Dactyl
Nest
8: Mountain of Woe > Dactyl Nest > Guardia Forest > Fiendlord's Keep >
Sunken Desert

Here we go! When you hop into the vortex, head north and up to the red spot
to be teleported to your first room.

============================
~Dactyl Nest; 65,000,000 BC~
============================
Fight the enemies blocking access to the north ladder. Climb it, then head
north and climb another ladder. Head left and follow the path south, fight
the foes if you wish, then climb another ladder on the right. Proceed all
the way north to another ladder, where you'll get into a simple forced
fight. Climb the ladder after it and go north to get warped.

==========================
~Fiendlord's Keep; 600 AD~
==========================
You're in the simplest room in the castle. Simply climb the staircases,
climbing down ladders to avoid the Roundillos that come down like Donkey
Kong barrels, and make your way to the exit at the very top of the room to
be warped.

=========================
~Guardia Forest; 1000 AD~
=========================
You start at the north end of the forest. Follow the left path down to the
south end of the forest. You should be able to avoid all of the fights on
your way there. It's insanely short and easy to get through, and the foes
wouldn't do much to you anyways even if you had to fight them.

===========================
~Manolia Cathedral; 600 AD~
===========================
Head up the stairs and go right. Head down the stairs, which will become a
ramp you can't climb up, then go through the door on the north wall. Avoid
the enemies in the small room and press the skull switch on the top left
wall, near the door, the lower the spikes in the center room you'll visit
soon. Head through the door and head north and left. Hug the north wall to
avoid a forced fight near the left end.

Follow the path all the way south, past some foes, and up a staircase back
to where you started. Enter the center door where spikes were, kill the
foes inside, then examine the organ. A door will appear in another area. Go
down a staircase, head north through both sets of doors, and to the long
hallway in the back. In the middle-north wall a door will have appeared.
Head through it to be warped.

============================
~Mountain of Woe; 12,000 BC~
============================
You start at the end of one of the largest rooms of the mountain, and need
to make your way back to the start of the room. Head left, kill the simple
forced fight foes, then head up the chain to the north. You'll get into
another forced fight after you get to the top of the chain. Head right,
north, then left and you'll get into another fight. Once killed, head
across the chain to the left.

Head left to the clearing and you'll fight a pair of Bomber Birds. Proceed
to the south end, then head left and north. Go right just a little bit to
see a ramp leading to a lower area of the cliff. Go down it and continue
down the path to the right. Don't head across the chain far to the right;
instead head down the path to the south after getting into a forced fight.
Midway down you'll have to fight more foes, but keep going south after
them. You'll see a large chain here. Climb down it to be warped to the next
area.

==================
~Site 16; 2300 AD~
==================
You have to progress through the first room. You start at the entrance, the
exit being in the top right. Be sure to avoid touching the rats or they'll
swipe Potions, of 500G if you have none. Head directly north from the
start, and when you see some foes you can skip past them using a hard to
see path on the right. After that, head further right to get into an easy
forced fight.

Keep heading north, left, then south. Stick to the southern edge of the
large clearing to avoid a fight, then head left and north to a group of
enemies. Hug the northern wall to avoid a fight with them, then head right,
avoid a final rat, then off the screen the be warped.

=======================
~Strath; 65,000,000 BC~
=======================
The new area added to the vortex. The exit is at the south end of the room,
and it's crazy linear to reach it. A few forced fights block your way, but
nothing too hard. Stick to the right wall and head south. You'll see some
green bushes, and if you look on the map you can see a nook is through
them. Walk through the bushes and you'll be on a ledge with a chest holding
the ANGEL'S TIARA, which grants haste and status immunity to the female
wearer. Nice.

Get out of the bushes and keep going south. Two forced fights block you and
the exit which will warp you.

=======================
~Sunken Desert; 600 AD~
=======================
The exit is at the north end of the room. You'll likely get into a bunch of
forced fights on your way there, though. Climb the stairs at the north end
to be warped.

===================================
~Nameless Cave; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
You arrive here after completing your fifth room. At the split path, go
right to find a save point. Head left and into the white cyclone if you
want to leave the vortex, and proceed north and enter the cyclone to be
transported to an all new area.

===================================
~Frozen Cliffs; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
One of the best songs in the game, by far. Head right and you'll get into
an easy forced fight with some Imps. Kill them all off, then climb the
cliff ladder (it's hard to see, it near the far right side and is a few icy
stones on the cliff). After climbing them, climb another icy ladder just
north of you, then head left. Climb down an icy ladder and you'll have to
fight a Chaos Mage. Once killed, open the chest for a MEGALIXIR. Climb back
up the ladder, then go up another ladder north of you.

There's nothing on the right, don't waste your time. Climb another ladder
north of you, then go left to find a chest holding a LAPIS. Follow the path
right and up another ladder. Go up yet another ladder to reach a clearing
with a bunch of Imps running around. Don't waste your time fighting any of
them. Head to the far left side and up another ice ladder and north to the
next area.

Climb several ice ladders and at the top you'll fight a group of Bone
Knights. Once these guys have been killed off, head right. For the record,
this room is a spawning point for Wonder Rocks. If you want a crapton of
Exp, TP, and the Lumicite Shard to get an item from the Lost Sanctum, this
is the greatest place to do it. Now, on the right side of this area you
should see a large strip of snow leading south that looks really weird.
This is, well, just that. A large slope. Be sure to be holding Up on the
D-Pad.

You'll be sliding down a slope now. You can't run up it, however if running
upwards you'll be stopped in place and can freely move left or right. Your
goal is to enter on the the several caverns on your descent. As soon as you
start falling, hold up and move left to the cavern on the far left side. Be
sure to land on the ledge ABOVE the hole, as it's impossible to slide left
onto the platform with the cavern. On the ledge above the hole, merely
climb down an ice ladder to access the cavern.

Head down the ladder south of where you enter. Open the chest and obtain
the SHADOWPLUME ROBE, the ultimate armor for Magus. Head up the ladder and
go right and fight a Bone Knight and a pair of Chaos Mages. Head down the
ladder they were blocking, head right to a chest with an ELIXIR, then
further right and down an ice ladder. Head right and north to find a large
cliff with an tall ice ladder. Climb it and follow the path left to land
back at the clearing with the Imps.

Make your way back to the slope. This time when you fall, run to the far
right side of the slope, then wait until you slide down to a ledge. Go down
the ladder and enter the cavern. Slide down the wall from where you enter,
then go left and fight some foes if you wish. Proceed off the screen to the
left.

=====================================
~Winding Passage; Dimensional Vortex~
=====================================
The same one as featured in the Lost Sanctum. Follow the path left until
you can see an area surrounded by walls with a chest in the corner. To
enter this seemingly impossible room, walk through the wall on the left
side of it. The chest contains the VENUS BOW, Marle's ultimate weapon. It
will do 777 damage to any foe it hits, no more no less.

Continue down the path to the left until you see another seemingly
impossible to access room. Walk through the wall on the right side of this
room and you can access the chest inside with a MEGALIXIR. Now, at the far
left side of the cave head north and right through a doorway. On the other
side is a chest with a TURBO ETHER. With all of the items in here obtained,
follow the linear path back out to the mountain.

===================================
~Frozen Cliffs; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
Head right, dodge the foes, and go down the ice ladder. The chest there
holds a HI-ETHER. Head right, kill the foes in a forced fight, then head
down the ice ladder at the end and proceed right. You can climb the ice
ladder on the far right again and head down the slope again if you wish,
but there're no more items to obtain from the slope. It's a waste of time
if you got the Shadowplume Robe and Venus Bow. For now, head right and off
the screen instead.

In the next area, follow the room south, then follow the south edge to the
far right until you see three ledges connecting to form a triangle of
sorts, appearing to split the room into three areas. There is a sparkly
capsule at each of these corners. The one you have access to right now is
the MAGIC CAPSULE. Pick it up and head north. A giant blue Snowbeast is
here. These guys hand over 2200 Exp, but have a ton of health. Its attack
power increases each time you attack it, so try to kill him quickly.

Hug the far right wall and head south. After a forced fight, head left and
to the second corner of the triangle those ledges from before made. Pick up
the sparkly SPEED CASPULE on the ground, then continue back to the far to
hugg the right wall and going south. You'll pass through an archway, then
you can go left to the bottom of those three corners and collect a STRENGTH
CAPSULE on the ground. Now head a little south and right. You'll find a
Snowbeast roaming around. Kill or avoid him and head right of where he's
guarding to find a chest holding a REGAL GOWN, a crazy good armor for
females.

On the far left side you can find an opening between two ledges. Head south
through them, and just left of a Snowbeast is a chest with an ELIXIR
inside. There's nothing else in this area, so head all the way right and
off the screen. In the next room, head right to get into a forced battle
with a pair of Snowbeasts. If you can defeat them quickly, you can leave
the screen and come back to attack them both again, getting 4400 Exp each
time. Really good for grinding if you don't like/can't access the Geno Dome
conveyor belt. Now, head up the linear path ahead of you and enter the
white cyclone at the end.

=====================================
~Twilight Grotto; Dimensional Vortex~
=====================================
Follow the simple path to a save point. Heal and save, then continue down
the linear road. The white cyclone ahead returns you to the world map.
Don't enter it and continue onwards. Near the end of the cave Marle will
request to be at the front of the party. Arrange your party. Lucca and
Robo/Magus are good choices for the team.

=======================================
~Castle Dreamscape; Dimensional Vortex~
=======================================
Follow the path into the bedroom to discover a clone of Marle. It sure
doesn't look too happy.

Recommended Levels-50+
----------------------------
A pretty simple fight. Her crossbow is much stronger than Marle's, unless
of course you obtained the Venus Bow. All you really need to do is smack
her with your strongest Techs. There's no real tricks to this battle. Her
Icefall Tech deals about 150 damage to everyone in the party...although by
this point in the game your entire team likely has maxed HP out at 999.
That's not much of a dent in it, not to mention Marle has a ton of healing
moves at her disposal to cleanse any significant damage dealt.

Barrage is simply her firing her crossbow at you. It's not a damaging
move. Overall, simple fight. Heal whenever necessary and beat the fake
Marle into the ground. Although keep attacking mainly since Recuperate
heals her for about 2500 HP.
===========================================================================
Marle will gain a permanent increase in Speed, Accuracy, and Stamina after
the battle. That's all for this vortex. Hopefully you collected all of
those awesome items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~10B.1000 AD Vortex~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The location of the vortex is just right of Leene Square. However, you can
only access it by flying there with the Epoch. It's slightly harder than
the 12,000 BC vortex, but regardless you've beaten Lavos already so this
place should still be a cakewalk.

Again, courtesy of Reptobismol for the eight room orders you can receive
when you enter the vortex:
1: Hallowed Falls > Black Omen > Prison Towers > Tyranno Lair > Truce
Canyon
2: Truce Canyon > Abandoned Sewers > Geno Dome > Ocean Palace > Hallowed
Falls
3: Black Omen > Prison Towers > Ocean Palace > Abadoned Sewers > Tyranno
Lair
4: Prison Towers > Geno Dome > Black Omen > Hallowed Falls > Ocean Palace
5: Abandoned Sewers > Hallowed Falls > Truce Canyon > Geno Dome > Prison
Towers
6: Tyranno Lair > Ocean Palace > Abandoned Sewers > Black Omen > Geno Dome
7: Ocean Palace > Tyranno Lair > Hallowed Falls > Truce Canyon > Abandoned
Sewers
8: Geno Dome > Truce Canyon > Tyranno Lair > Prison Towers > Black Omen

=======================
~Black Omen; 12,000 BC~
=======================
Head a little north then left. You'll have to fight two Ghaj's and two
Narbles. Kill them all off with relative ease (never use physical attacks
against the Ghaj's. Insta counter OHKO if you do), then head left, all the
way north, then right up the stairs. Examine the Nomads if you wish to
fight a Watcher, then head right down the stairs, north, then left. Fight
another pair of Ghaj's, then go left and north through the door to be
warped.

===========================
~Abandoned Sewers; 2300 AD~
===========================
You're in the section where there's a bunch of things on the floor that
make noise. If you examine any of them, or step on the fake save point,
enemies will attack you. Reach the end of the passageway with ease and
you'll be warped.

====================
~Geno Dome; 2300 AD~
====================
The infamous Geno Dome Conveyor Belt is the room you must complete. I
wouldn't be complaining as that's a good amount of Exp and TP. Once you
complete all five battles along the belt, exit through the north door to
be warped.

====================================
~Hallowed Falls; Dimensional Vortex~
====================================
Given the music, it's a depressing new area. Head left over the bridge,
fight some Ogan Youths, then keep heading left. Squeeze past another Ogan
if you can, then climb the ladder and follow the path to the waterfall.
There's a path behind the waterfall, so walk through it. At the far right
end you'll fight even more Ogans. Kill them and head north to be warped.

=========================
~Ocean Palace; 12,000 BC~
=========================
Head down the stairs and you'll fight a bunch of enemies in the center of
the area. Once killed, head south down another set of stairs. Try not to
touch any of the Monks bouncing on the stairs. Each one you touch you will
have to battle in the next clearing. After that, continue south and down
another set of stairs. Evade the Monks in the clearing if you can so you
don't have to battle, but don't stand still or the statues will hurt you.
Head down another set of stairs and you'll have to fight more foes in
another clearing. After that, head down the last set of stairs to warp.

========================
~Prison Towers; 1000 AD~
========================
Head right, kill the Royal Guard, then follow the path north and left when
you get the chance. Kill another guard by the stairs, then take the stairs
to be warped.

======================
~Truce Canyon; 600 AD~
======================
You start at the exit and must reach the entrance. Head left up the ladder,
north and then right to a ladder, and after climbing down it walk right off
the screen to be warped.

=============================
~Tyranno Lair; 65,000,000 BC~
=============================
You're in the room with the warping tiles on the floor. You need to make
your way to the stairs in the top left corner to warp. It's not hard to
get there--simply hold up and left as you get into the room, and you will
reach the north end of the room without a problem. Just walk left to the
stairs from there.

===================================
~Nameless Cave; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
Like before, head right at the crossroads to a save point, left to a
cyclone that will take you back to the world map, and north to proceed
further in the vortex.

=============================
~Volcano; Dimensional Vortex~
=============================
Oooh yay! We finally get into a volcano! Proceed up the path to the north,
going through the doorway at the end. A trio of Dire Rats are waiting in
the next room. If you can get into their formation and get onto the path
leading right, you'll avoid fighting them. North goes to a dead end for
now. You'll want to avoid Dire Rats like the plague in here. Those who've
done the Lost Sanctum know these guys are annoying as hell. They'll steal
some MP before you have a chance to kill them. Very annoying.

On the right path, follow it over the lava until you reach a clearing
where you'll be attacked by a Fireball and a pair of Dire Rats. Fireballs
are also annoying foes, absorbing all magic except Water (naturally) and
wielding the Fire II move. Once killed, proceed north and left through a
doorway. Two chests will be in this small room, them being a MASTER'S CROWN
and an ATHENIAN WATER. The Master's Crown boosts damage and prevents status
ailments. Great armor. In the previous room, follow the path right and
south.

You'll encounter a Red Ghaj during your trek. They'll counter all magic
attacks with Flare, so try sticking with physical moves as you whittle
away its HP. It hands out 2300 Exp when killed, so that's not a bad payout.
Now, stand where the Red Ghaj was (right in the center of the path) and go
south a few steps. You can walk left through the wall to a small clearing
next to the lava, with a sparkly STRENGTH CAPSULE in the bottom left
corner. Walk through the wall to the lower right and south off the screen.

===================================
~Mount Emerald; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
...Mt. Emerald? Odd. A chest at the end of this short path holds the
DREAMREAPER, which happens to be the ultimate scythe for Magus. It deals 
four times as much damage when it gets a critical hit, making Magus a good 
choice for the Dragon's Tear item. Leave back to the volcano.

=============================
~Volcano; Dimensional Vortex~
=============================
Head back through the walls and back to the main path. Follow it right to
the next room. Follow the trail all the way to the north end, then head
right to a fight with some Fireballs, but only if you can't avoid them.
Wait for them to move and sneak by. Keep following the linear trail right
(that doorway on a lower ledge will be accessed in a little while) and you
will have to fight a set of four Dire Rats. Once killed off, keep going
right and then down a ladder. Go down another ladder and you'll have to
fight a Red Ghaj.

Once he's dead, go south down another ladder. Follow the trail until you
reach three Fireballs. Ignore them and follow the path right, however hold
right as you go down the ramp and you'll walk through the wall. You'll end
up in a small nook with a chest holding the SPELLSLINGER, the ultimate gun
for Lucca. Get back on the main path and follow it left and south to the
next room.

Follow the thin trail left and north up a ladder. Evade the Deathcreepers
if you can, then head right and up a pair of ladders. Head left down a
ladder, then a little more left and up another ladder. When presented with
two ladders, head up the left one and grab the STRENGTH CAPSULE from the
sparkly on the ground at the top. Now go up the right one and kill off the
Deathcreepers. Go down the ladder they were guarding to grab an ELIXIR from
the chest. Then go up the ladder they were also guarding and through the
doorway at the top.

You're back in the room you started at. Press the green switch on the wall
to make the lava lower throughout the volcano. Head south and across the
ground (which had lava before) and you'll fight a Red Ghaj. Head north
back to the room with a trio of Dire Rats walking around. Try to get past
them without getting into a fight and take the north path this time. There
is a ladder leading downwards at the end. Take it and enter the doorway at
the bottom. Inside press the switch labeled "Crater surveillance ladder".

Head out of the room and go up the ladder. Head back to the Dire Rats and
take the path right this time. Follow the path across the room, fighting
the Fireball and the Red Ghaj near the exit in the bottom right, then head
to the next room.

Follow the long path north to the top of the room. Head right, dodge the
Fireballs if you can, and keep going right until you see a ladder leading
to the doorway you had to ignore earlier. It's just before the forced Dire
Rat fight. Grab the HI-POTION from the chest next to the bottom of the
ladder, then head left through the doorway.

This room is just one long trail to the right. You'll have to kill a trio
of Fireballs and a pair of Red Ghaj's waiting for you at the end, just
before the cyclone. Enter it to be warped away from this place.

=====================================
~Twilight Grotto; Dimensional Vortex~
=====================================
Follow the path to the save point, be sure to heal and save, then continue
down the linear road to the left. You can enter the cyclone here to return
to the world map, or go just a bit further north and fight...
===========================================================================
BOSS-Once-King Dalton
HP-26000
Defense-110/Magic Defense-72
Exp-6000/TP-0/G-0

Techs:                    Counters:
Iron Sphere (Halves HP)   MP Buster (Absorbs all MP)
Gale Slash                Violent Belch
Energy Sphere
Scorch (Fire Tech)
Deep Freeze (Water Freeze)
Plasma (Light Tech)
Nether Blast (Shadow Tech)

Recommended Levels-55+
----------------------------
Don't take this fight against Dalton lightly. He's far, far more dangerous
than his previous two joke encounters. With high magic defense like that,
sticking to physical attacks is your best bet. A team of Ayla/Robo/Crono
prevails here. Robo and Ayla's Double Tech, Beast Toss, can do a good 5000+
damage to him. Yeah, that's only a few attacks needed to kill him off, hm?

Of course, it's not that simple. He busts out MP Buster (no pun intended)
after losing a decent chunk of his health. He counters with it, so you'll
be constantly drained of your MP. Of course, if you work fast in depleting
his HP you likely will skip over the point where he uses it. When he's
getting low on HP he'll start spamming his high powered Techs, although
at relatively high levels they really shouldn't do a lot of damage. I've
never witnessed him use Iron Sphere, but it's clearly his most dangerous
attack if it gets used.
===========================================================================
Head back to the save point and heal, then continue past where you fought
Dalton and Crono will request to head the party. Arrange your party (Crono/
Ayla/Robo all the way, baby!) and you'll be transported to...
===========================================================================
BOSS-Steel Shade
HP-20000
Defense-170/Magic Defense-65
Exp-5000/TP-1/G-0

Magic:
Weak to Shadow, Immune to Light

Techs:                     Counters:
Gash                       Gash
Energy Blast (Light Tech)  Energy Blast (Light Tech)
Rend                       Rend
Thunderfall (Light Tech)
Scintillation (Light Tech)

Recommended Levels-55+
----------------------------
You just got finished beating up Dalton. Whatever tactics you used to kill
him quickly simply repeat in this fight. It's not terribly hard. Beast
Toss does 3000+ damage, and Frenzy can do about 1200 damage. If you have
any Shadow Techs, now would be the time to use them. Crono/Ayla/Robo's
Triple Tech can do 3500+ damage. Crazy stuff.

All of his attacks are crazy weak, none of them should be doing more than
100 damage to your party. The exception is Scintillation (it's just
Luminaire), which he uses when he runs low on HP. This move can do 300+
damage to your party, but at the time he uses it he should be so close to
being killed that it should not be an actual threat.
===========================================================================
After the battle, Crono's Speed, Strength, and Accuracy will increase
permanently. That wraps up this vortex. Well done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~10C.2300 AD Vortex~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This vortex is located just north of the Geno Dome. As such, you need to
fly there with the Epoch. If you don't know where the Geno Dome is, it's
on an island near the bottom right corner of the map.

It is the hardest of the three vortexes, but I seriously think you're
capable of handling it. Once again, thanks to Reptobismol for the final
order list of the rooms you may enter:
1: Arris Dome Substructure > Heckran Cave > Ancient Keep > Denadoro
Mountains > Forest Maze
2: Mudbeast Den > Ancient Keep > Curious Village > Forest Maze >
Fiendlord's Keep
3: Heckran Cave > Fiendlord's Keep > Arris Dome Substructure > Mudbeast
Den > Denadoro Mountains
4: Forest Maze > Mudbeast Den > Heckran Cave > Fiendlord's Keep >
Denadoro Mountains
5: Fiendlord's Keep > Forest Maze > Mudbeast Den > Ancient Keep >
Curious Village
6: Curious Village > Denadoro Mountains > Fiendlord's Keep > Heckran
Cave > Arris Dome Substructure
7: Denadoro Mountains > Arris Dome Substructure > Forest Maze > Curious
Village > Mudbeast Den
8: Ancient Keep > Curious Village > Denadoro Mountains > Arris Dome
Substructure > Heckran Cave

==================================
~Ancient Keep; Dimensional Vortex~
==================================
One of the new areas added, and by far the largest. Head left down the
hallway to fight a pair of Dire Rats. Kill them and head north. At the
north end of the hallway you'll have to fight a Deathcreeper and a pair of
Dire Rats. After that, head all the way right to the end of the hallway.
You'll have to kill the pair of Deathcreepers guarding the chest, which
contains a HI-POTION.

Return to the middle of this hallway and head south. Now head right, fight
the enemies, then go all the way south and defeat several more foes that
are guarding a chest. It holds 50,000G. After getting it, head north a
little bit and walk through the left wall to reach a chest containing an
ELIXIR. Now head north and all the way to the left end of the hallway.
Defeat the Bone Knights and follow the hallway all the way to the south
end. Defeat the Bone Knights and Deathcreeper, then head right and south.
Walk right of the stairs and through a wall to find a chest with a MASTER'S
CROWN inside. Awesome stuff.

Now head up the stairs and fight a pair of Dire Rats, Deathcreepers, and
Bone Knights. Once everyone is killed, head through the north doorway to be
warped.

==================================
~Arris Dome Substructure; 2300 AD~
==================================
Head north, onto the metal gratings and follow it around a corner. On the
other side of the wall, continue north, follow the path on the metal
gratings on the left, and follow them to a door at the end to be warped.

=====================================
~Curious Village; Dimensional Vortex~
=====================================
If only Professor Layton was here! In this new area you'll need to answer
four questions asked by four separate kids. The majority of these questions
are insanely easy if you paid attention to the story--stuff such as what
era did Lavos first arrive in and what was required to mend the Masamune.
Other questions are insanely obscure, such as the amount of arms on the
statue behind Magus when you fought him (like anybody even noticed a
statue there), or the name of Cyrus's attack (doubtful many people paid
attention to the name in the brief moment it was yelled).

If you get a question wrong, you'll be brought to the Hall of Punishment.
You'll have to get to the door at the end to return to the hall with
questions, however you'll need to fight your way through several Nus to
reach it. When you return, the kid will be gone as if you had gotten the
question right, and you can continue to the next question.

Reptobismol's guide is here:
http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file/950181/55094
It houses all of the questions the kids can ask you. If you're stumped,
just Ctrl+F the question and you'll be brought to the answer. Not a
terribly hard room. Go through the last door to be warped.

============================
~Denadoro Mountains; 600 AD~
============================
Head all the way up north, up a ladder, and into a forced fight with some
Ogans. Kill them off, then head right across the bridge. Proceed south, and
when you reach the ladder be careful as an Ogan will attempt ambushing you
from off screen. Get past him if you can, then go up the ladder, go north
up another ladder, and right off the screen at the end to be warped.

==========================
~Fiendlord's Keep; 600 AD~
==========================
You simply need to make your way up the stairs at the north end of the room
to be warped. However, you'll need to fight through four waves of simple
enemies to reach it.

============================
~Forest Maze; 65,000,000 BC~
============================
Head right, under the archway, then north. You'll get into a forced fight
with some Crested Sprinters. Continue left, up the hill leading north and
following the path going right. Head south at the end, then keep following
it until you have to go right. Head right and north to a clearing where
you'll get into a forced battle with more Crested Sprinters. Keep going
north, right, south, and you'll have looped around to the lower level of
the maze.

Follow the path north to another clearing. Kill the simple foes in the
forced fight, then head north, left, and north all the way to the top end
of the maze (you may get into another forced fight on the way there). Head
left, then south, then go left across a wooden log. Go north and up a pair
of vines to be on a high cliff, then go left through an opening between
the bushes, then north off the screen to be warped.

=======================
~Heckran Cave; 1000 AD~
=======================
You'll be forced to fight insanely easy enemies as soon as you enter. Head
north and left, go down a ladder and another after that, head left to fight
some foes, then south for the stairs to be warped.

=========================
~Mudbeast Den; 12,000 BC~
=========================
Very simple room. Just proceed to the north end and up the chain that is
there to be warped. You'll have to kill two pairs of Mudbeasts to reach it,
however.

===================================
~Nameless Cave; Dimensional Vortex~
===================================
As always, head right at the crossroads to a save point, left if you wish
to go back to the world map, and north if you want to continue with the
vortex.

===========================================
~Temporal Research Lab; Dimensional Vortex~
===========================================
What an ominous place. Follow the room left and north through a door. In
the next room there will be a bunch of conveyor belts. Several areas in
this room will force you into Searcher fights. They are really easy foes,
making this room more annoying than hard. Head north to find a note on the
ground. Read it to gain a hint on a code necessary later. Go right and to
a Searcher fight. After it, head south to be in the bottom right corner,
then walk right and through the wall.

====================================
~Millennia Wood; Dimensional Vortex~
====================================
Why did all three vortexes sample areas from the Lost Sanctum? Who knows.
Go left and south through a hole between the trees. Grab the TURBO ETHER
from the chest, then go back north. Head right, then go north through a gap
between the trees and open the chest for 50,000G. Now, head south. Before
reaching the southern end you should see a nook to the left on the map. You
can walk through some trees to reach this nook. Approach it from the south
end of the map, following the left trail of trees, and you'll get into the
nook. It has a chest holding a MEGALIXIR.

Head to the southern point of the forest and head right. Hug the right wall
of trees and you'll head into a small nook with a chest containing the
APOCALYPSE ARM, Robo's ultimate weapon. This sucker deals 9999 damage if it
gets a critical hit, no matter what. Slap that Dragon's Tear on Robo
because he's a beast with it. Problem is that without a critical hit the
Apocalypse Arm is about as strong as Robo's weakest weapon. Use it wisely.

Head all the way to the north end of the forest. At the top of the clearing
you can find a chest with a MEGALIXIR inside. There's nothing else here, so
return to where you entered and back to the lab.

===========================================
~Temporal Research Lab; Dimensional Vortex~
===========================================
Head left to be back at the starting point of the room. Go north back to
the note, then go left and you'll get into a Searcher fight. Head south
then left to find another note on the ground. It flat out tells you what
the security code is, but it's incorrect. Piece together this and the
previous note and you will have the code. Head north, north again, right,
and north to a Searcher fight. Head left and you'll be in the top left
corner of the room. Go through the door up here.

You'll be in a room with red lasers blocking off the path to the left. Head
through the door to the north instead, then head left. You'll arrive at
sets of different styled tiles, with Prototypes walking about on them. Your
goal is to get past the Prototypes without them seeing you. Pretty simple.
If you get seen, the Prototype will knock you into a pit where you'll have
to fight a pair of Prototypes. Remember that these guys have high defense
until you use Lightning (II)/Luminaire on them. The exit is to the south,
and you'll reappear at the start of the stealth area.

Getting past the first one is easy. Wait for him to turn around then run to
the safe area. The second one is even easier because you can fully see his
path. Wait for him to turn around when it reaches the top right corner,
then run left to the safe area. The third one is a little harder. When it
turns around at the top left corner, run to the top left area to a safe
zone. The fourth and final one is somewhat tricky to reach if you're slow.
You can just barely see the top of the Prototype. Wait for it to turn
around then make a dash for the top left corner of the room.

Proceed left to the next room. Head left, north through the door, then
north to the end of the hallway. Examine the computer and opt to release
the security locks. If you were too lazy to examine the papers, or lack
common sense, the password is "BALL". B button, A button, L button, L
button. After the ding-dong, put in that code. Make sure you wait for the
confirmation ching before pressing the next button. With the code entered
the lasers will be down.

CHANGE YOUR PARTY. Make your current party the group of three you DON'T
want to use. You'll understand why in a bit. Head right and you'll need to
get past the group of four Prototypes again. Not fun this time since the
first two are almost impossible to see beforehand, making running to the
safe zone a pure guess. Once you reach the far right side, head south. Hmm,
the lasers are still here. Worse yet, you're trapped in this room. Three
of your remaining four partners will rush up to attempt to save them, only
to find out the security release computer is located in the right side of
the lab.

You don't have access to the party that has been trapped, hence why you
wanted to change to crap until a little while ago so you still have your
powerhouse team now. Regardless, you need to reach the top right corner of
the conveyor belt room. Head south, right, and north to battle a Searcher.
Head right then right again to be in the area you need to be. Enter the
door in the top right corner.

You'll be in a labyrinth of sorts. Head north to find a sparkly spot.
Instead of being an item it's actually a warp. Step on it to warp to a
different area. Go north to find three different warps. Take the left warp
and then go to the right end of the hallway you appear in. Before taking
the warp there, pick up the small sparkly MAGIC CAPSULE. Use the warp here
to return to the starting point.

Go back to the area with three warps, then choose the right warp. Go into
the warp at the far right side of this hallway, dodging the Prototype
guarding it if you can, and enter the warp. You'll be in a room with two
warps. Take the bottom warp and you'll be in a room with a door and two
warps. The door we'll use in a second. For now, take the right warp. Head
right down the hallway and obtain the REGAL PLATE from the chest, then go
into the warp at the end. Head into the warp on the left in the next room
to return to the beginning.

Remember the door you ignored? You want to enter it now. To get back there,
go back to the room with three warps, take the right one, then take the
warp at the far right side of the hallway, and finally take the bottom
warp. Go through the door.

You'll have to fight a series of five enemies when you enter this room.
First up is a simple Searcher. Once killed you'll need to fight a
Prototype. Still not too bad. The third fight is against a pair of
Searchers. Still not bad. The fourth fight is against a pair of Prototypes.
Luminaire should make short work of them.

The final battle is against an Iron Maiden. This beast has 10000 HP, and
an attack that reduces the health of your entire party by half. And yes, it
uses it a lot. If the battle drags on too long it'll just use Self-Destruct
and save you the trouble of killing it. Very annoying battle. Smack it with
everything you have quickly.

Once the battles are over, examine the computer console. One of your party
members will deactivate the lasers and unlock the room your other party
members are trapped. Switch back to your main team, then follow the newly
opened path. You'll have to dodge more Prototypes as you make your way
this time to the bottom left corner of the room. None of these should be a
problem as you can easily see when they turn around, giving you plenty of
time to run to the next safe zone. Enter the door at the bottom left
corner.

This room is mainly a long hallway. You want to reach the end, naturally,
but random sparks come out of the wall in intervals. If you get stuck in
one, don't move. You'll just drain your health at a quick rate. In the
first clearing, you'll face a Searcher and an Iron Maiden. I say just run
away from the fights in this room. Screw Iron Maidens. Proceed to the north
end of the room to fight a pair of Iron Maidens. Fight or flight, really.
After that, head through the door to the north and into the cyclone to get
the hell out of here.

=====================================
~Twilight Grotto; Dimensional Vortex~
=====================================
Follow the linear path to the save point. Save and use a Shelter, then
continue left. As always, enter this cyclone if you want to go to the world
map. If not, continue north. At the end of the path Lucca will request to
head the party. Arrange your party as necessary, and be sure to put on some
Fire-resistant armor. It'll help.

Recommended Levels-55+
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. The Eggsterminator is the real foe here, but
don't scoff at such low HP considering how high its defenses are. Lucca
should hopefully have Flare, so spam the hell out of that to deal a ton of
damage to the Eggsterminator. The most annoying thing about the fight is
that it will counter every single attack with Osmose. You'll be drained of
your HP really quickly, so keep an eye on it and restore whenever needed.

Crimson Shade's moves should not harm your party terribly much. Shadow Fire
is simple Fire II, and Explosion is Flare. 200 damage to your entire party
at most, but not something that a little healing can't mend. Speaking of
which, Eggsterminator's Recover heals itself and Crimson Shade's for 1000
HP. Hence why you'll want to kill the Eggsterminator quickly, so as to stop
that damn move from constantly occurring.

Crimson Shade herself is quite easy once she's by herself. Bash her with
non-Fire magic and physical moves until she falls. 
===========================================================================
After the fight, Lucca's speed, magic, and stamina will permanently
increase. That's it for this vortex.

~The End of Time~
=================
Once you have beaten the bosses of all three Dimensional Vortexes, return
to the End of Time. Talk to the old man and he'll say that a greater power
is flowing into the bucket that leads to the Day of Lavos...the border of
Time's Eclipse. When you try entering the bucket, you'll have the option of
going to the Day of Lavos or Time's Eclipse. I think you know which place
to choose. Be sure to have a bunch of healing items (although if you have
Robo with the Apocalypse Arm and a Dragon's Tear on him, the upcoming
superboss is a joke).

You'll witness a certain someone up ahead. Head over to him and he'll say
something before hopping into the Time Gate. Follow him to...well, the
added boss of Chrono Trigger DS.

FINAL BOSS-Dream Devourer
HP-32000
Defense-220/Magic Defense-80 (Varies)

Magic:
Varies between different phases

Techs:  Counters:
???     ???

Recommended Levels-60+
----------------------------
Okay, let's get one thing straight about the superboss. He has two phases,
and he switches between them as he takes damage. The Techs he uses in them
also change, and since they are not listed in the Bestiary their actual
names are taken right from the battle. He also has a secret phase that only
occurs when one member of your team is left standing. Regardless, let's
settle this.

The first phase is relatively simple to understand. His main attack is to
"Devour dreams from another dimension", dealing about 200 damage to the
whole party. He uses it before anybody can get an attack in. Dream Devourer
doesn't have any other forms. It's just a straight up 32000 HP boss. From
here on out you'll want to bash it with every strong move in your aresenal.
Give it all hell.

He will counter every non-magic attack with Mana Reaver, which swipes away
all of your MP. As such, stick strictly to magic attacks. You need to be
doing damage to this guy constantly, and this is realistically your only
way. He'll also use Mana Reaver as a normal attack occasionally, making
chugging down Hi-Ethers a constant priority for your team.

Dreambind inflicts Stop on one member of the party, but at this point you
should be wearing status immunity equipment, making it a moot attack. He
has Curse much like Lavos, so if he chooses to use it then your status
immunity equipment is pointless. His Incinerate attack is a bit more
powerful than Flare, dealing 250+ damage to your entire party. Likewise,
Heavenly Peel is similar to Luminaire, only a bit more powerful.

Life Reaver does an insane amount of damage to one character, but it and
Curse (described earlier) will be thrown into his movepool when he's lost
around 10000 HP. Other moves he has is Starfall, which does a ton of damage
to a single character. Gravity Sphere will do a decent amount of damage to
your entire party.

Once you've drained about half of his health, he'll switch to the second
phase. He starts this by "Lowers Defense and begins storing power." You
can't possibly miss that notice. Now, he absorbs all magic types, so you
will have to stick with physical attacks. Take this time to pound on him
with strong physical moves, but more importantly make sure your entire team
has a ton of HP. He counters all attacks with Chaos Zone, dealing about 100
damage to your entire party.

After a few attacks Dream Devourer will use "The End of All and Nothing",
a souped up version of Destruction Rains from the Heavens. He keeps his
Life Reaver and Starfall moves, now gaining Supernova (with mimics
Luminaire in the aspect that it'll hit your entire party for a lot of
damage), Ice Lance (simply Ice II, probably his weakest attack), and
Pandemonium (deals a low amount of damage to your whole party).

Oh, it also has Phantasm. One of his strongest attacks, it deals a ton of
magical damage to your entire party.

Now, the general strategy at this point is, again, pound on him with
physical attacks. The fight should be over soon as you'll likely being
doing a lot more damage than with just magic attacks. Remember to keep
healing as he'll always be countering with Chaos Zone.

However...if you manage to get knocked down to just one party member, Dream
Devourer will change his attack pattern until you have two or all of your
team members standing. His four attacks consist of the painful Life
Reaver, the powerful Heavenly Peel, the strong Starfall, and the weak
Dreambind. He'll counter with Mana Reaver or Chaos Zone depending on which
phase he is currently in. Plain and simple, revive one of your allies as
soon as possible. Going solo against those moves isn't a smart idea.
===========================================================================
And with that the Dimensional Vortex quest comes to a close. Witness the
final cutscenes, then after the credits Crono will obtain the Dreamseeker,
the most powerful weapon in the game for him, which maxes out his Attack
stat and has a 90% chance of a critical hit. Well done.

===========================================================================
                         ~11.Arena of the Ages~
===========================================================================
The final new area put into Chrono Trigger DS, the Arena of the Ages is a
unique area where essentially breed your own monster and put it in battles
versus other monsters in, naturally, hopes of winning.

This may seem completely pointless, and to many people it is. However,
raising your own monster from scratch can actually be quite fun, not to
mention that if you want to collect every single item in the game then you
have no choice but to play the Arena of Ages. Six rare items, and eight
purchasable items, can only be found in the Arena. You might as well step
foot in it at least once during some playthrough.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~11A.Finding the Arena~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to reach the Arena of the Ages. The first way is
accessing it from the End of Time. Just left of the door leading to
Spekkio you will find one of the portals much like the ones at the left end
of the End of Time leading to different eras. Enter this portal to arrive
at the Arena of the Ages.

The alternate method is selecting the Arena option from the title screen
menu. You'll have to choose a file you wish to use the Arena in, and then
you will be taken right to the Arena. However, there is a catch in the
Arena when accessed from the title screen. You MUST save your progress in
the Arena before you either turn off your DS or choose to return to the
title screen, otherwise no data will be saved. If you don't save, no harm
will come to the file because merely the Arena data is loaded, rather than
the entire file itself.

Other than this there are no restrictions to when you can access the Arena
and partake in its fun. Yes, you can have an insane monster before you even
meet Marle if you so choose.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ~11B.First Time in the Arena~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon your first visit to the Arena a man will come to greet you. He's the
stable master, and you'll likely be talking to him a lot in the future. You
should probably request for a rundown of how the Arena works. Simply put,
monsters are raised here, then placed into pit fights. If you want a fight,
the man you need to talk to is shown. The pit boss is in the middle-north
end of the room.

The Nu here houses a shop. There are a variety of items used for training
and battle purposes, and the Nu is your one-stop shop for all of these
items. You'll get to know them very quickly. The stable master will also
notify you that if you were to enter the Arena from the title screen, you
MUST save your progress before leaving or quitting the game. If you came
from the End of Time, you can save here or anywhere else in the game for
your progress in the Arena to be kept.

Once his explanation is done, talk to him again. Answer that you've got the
need to raise a monster for yourself. Obtaining a monster is free, but
raising it is going to cost a little money (and a lot of patience). You
will be given the choice of four smidges. The red has a Fire affinity, blue
has Water, yellow is Light, and purple is Shadow. Stand behind the smidge
you want and press the A button to take that smidge as your own monster.

After picking your monster you will get a starter's kit, which contains one
of all of the items you can use for training your monster. Or, you can use
them in pit battles to aid your monster in a fight. All eight of these
items are sold by the Nu, so you can more than easily replenish your
supply when you run out.

You'll be shown your smidge's initial stats. Basically they suck, really
really hard. However, that's what training is for. You gotta increase your
stats somehow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ~11C.Training Your Monster~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to have any success in the Arena, you will have to train your
monster up to have great stats. Sure, your lone smidge is capable of taking
down a few Tier 1 enemies, and you will be able to get a few prizes from
it (Mops and Iron Swords are so great!), but you honestly won't get too far
with it.

Thus, you train your monster. To start with, let's review each stat that
your monster has. Remember, you can check your monster's stats by talking
to the stable master.
HP-How much HP your monster has. Run out and you lose the battle.
Strength--The higher it is the more damage physical attacks will do
Speed--The higher it is the shorter the time that is needed to attack
Evasion--The higher this is, the more likely your monster will avoid enemy
attacks
Magic Defense--The higher it is, the less damage your monster will receive
from magic attacks
Accuracy--The higher is is the more likely your monster's attacks will hit
the enemy
Magic--The higher this is, the more damage magical attacks do
Stamina--Every point in this stat adds additional HP to your monster
Trust--The higher this is, the more likely your monster will use the item
you give it in battle

Now, when you want to train your monster you have to attach one of the
eight items to it. The items are:
Slops--Boosts maximum HP
Flameclaw--Teaches Fire Techs, may alter affinity
Seafang--Teaches Water Techs, may alter affinity
Duskeye--Teaches Shadow Techs, may alter affinity
Luxwing--Teaches Light Techs, may alter affinity
Hawk Talon--Boosts offensive stats
Shield Cloak--Boosts defensive stats
Feral Wrath--Boosts probability of a class change occurring

Finally, you must choose an era for your monster to train in. You can only
train in era which you have visited at least once in the story. For example
if you try out the Arena as soon as you make a new file, you can only train
in the Present era. The eras and their stat altering affects are:
Prehistory--Train for Speed
Antiquity--Train for Techs
Middle Ages--Train for Strength
Present--Train for maximum HP
Future--Train for Accuracy and Stamina

Once you have selected everything, your monster will go off for training.
Now what do you do? Well, you either continue on with your adventure and
come back to the Arena later, or you just sit here. Doing nothing.

Well, your monster will NEVER come back if you stay in the Arena of the
Ages. Stay as long as you wish, you'll never see it again until you leave.
Training takes exactly 10 minutes to complete. Once you return to the Arena
after 10 minutes, your monster will be shown coming back from its training.

You can stay in the Arena for the full 10 minutes if you so desire. However
in order to see your monster again you must go back to the End of Time and
come right back to the Arena, or save and go to the title screen and enter
the Arena again. Either way, you must leave the Arena at some point in
order for your monster to come back. Also, these are 10 ingame minutes.
If you save your file and the timer is at 34:12, your monster will not be
finished with training until the timer is on or past 34:22. So no, you
can't close your DS and do something else. Bust out the charger, because
you may be here awhile.

And for those who are entering through the title screen, this means you
must wait in the Arena 10 minutes before going back to the title screen in
order for your monster to finish training.

So, what happens when your monster finally comes back? Well, the most
obvious effect that you'll be looking for is the stat changes. Now, the RNG
has its fair share of being a bastard. Your monster's stats can either go
up or down. Sometimes you'll have stat increases in almost every stat,
sometimes almost every stat will decrease instead. One stat that will never
increase through training and instead usually decreases is Trust. Trust can
only be raised by having your monster fight.

Stat changes are not the only thing that can happen to your monster. It may
change affinities, such as going from Shadow to Fire. The best drastic
change is that your monster will change classes altogether. The likelihood
of any of these events is quite low, however that's what the items you give
it to train with help boost the odds of these things happening. The Tech
items can help change affinities, while the Feral Wrath can boost the odds
of a class change. More on classes in the next section.

Also, your monster can sometimes pick up an item while training and you
will collect it when it comes back. The items it can pick up are generally
crappy, but it's something to keep in mind.

For those curious, the best item and era combination for increasing the
most stats is a Hawk Talon and the Future era. Every stat usually goes up
except Magic and Magic Defense, which usually decrease a bit. However with
such high evasion (eventually) such attacks will never matter and using
Techs is a gamble. And most are quite weak. Physical moves all the way!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~11D.Monster Classes~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in the previous section, your monster may change classes when
it comes back from training. This is actually VERY advantageous, and you
should be going for a promotion of classes once your tiny smidge gets
decent stats and you're sick of crap Tier 1 battles.

Promotion is completely up to the RNG. You could go through 100 training
sessions and still be stuck with a smidge. Honestly that's highly unlikely,
but it is not impossible.

You're capable of boosting the odds of a class change by giving your
monster the Feral Wrath item when it goes out for training. I am unaware
as to the odds a monster has of changing classes, and I don't know how much
the Feral Wrath boosts the odds. I can't find anything on these odds
anywhere, but I'm simply assuming they're low. Very, very low.

Now, there are three tiers of monsters, not including your smidge as a
tier. You cannot jump straight to the third tier from a smidge. You have
to change to a tier one monster, then tier two, and finally a top tier
monster. The problem with this is that when changing classes you can
actually demote a class. Yeah, your tier one monster can actually change
back into a smidge if you're unlucky. It's a very rare instance so don't
expect such a fate. Also, monsters can change classes without changing
tiers. An uncommon occurrence, but it's better than demoting a tier.

There are large variety of monster classes. Each one has its three tiers of
monsters. When your monster changes, it can also change classes entirely
from it's current class. For instance, if you have an Outlaw (a tier one
Bird monster), it can change into a Freelancer (tier two Bird monster), it
can change into the second tier of any other class, or it can change into
tier one of any other class. It's completely random.

One final note about classes is that the third tier of some classes have no
affinities. Their magic Techs obviously will not work since they don't have
an affinity, and thus cannot be used. Pay attention to the classes your
monster ends up in.

The greatest advantage to changing classes is a huge upgrade in stats,
especially HP. Also, most second and third tier monsters have a really high
critical hit rate. It makes winning battles provided you give them a Feral
Wrath in it, really simple as they'll dish out tons of damage effortlessly.

The following list of monster classes was compiled by Reptobismol in one of
his topics on the boards. The list was altered by other users throughout
the topic. I'm not entirely able to comprehend a whole lot of it, so here's
the basic list of monster tiers (yes, Ogan class only has two tiers
instead of three). They're listed in order of tier one, two, and three:
Weevils:              Knights:      Nagas:            Armadillos:
Hercules Beetle       Holy Knight   Naga              Fiendillo
Rhino Weevil          Royal Guard   Gorgon            Roundillo
Aecyto Weevil         Blademan      Medusa            Roundillo Bomber

Ogans:                Ninja Birds:  Robots:           Skeletons (Legged):
Ogan                  Outlaw        Version 2.0       Spearman
Ogan Youth            Freelancer    Version 4.0       Lancer
                      Ninja         Prototype         Bone Knight

Skeletons (Legless):  Apes:         Small Dinosaurs:  Large Dinosaurs:
Flesh Reaper          Bao Bao       Crested Splinter  Terasaur
Macabre               Gokuu         Racer             Gigantosaur
Deathscythe           Cave Ape      Parasaur          Chrysosaur

Imps:                 Mages:        Gargoyles:
Pink Imp              Chaos Mage    Gargoyle
Stone Imp             Zealot Mage   Stone Gargoyle
Slate Imp             Archmage      Spirit Gargoyle

Bosses (Cannot be obtained):
Ouroboros
R-70Y
Deathguard
Dokra
Uberhulk
Ice Demon

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~11E.Monster Battles~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main purpose of the Arena is to put your monster into battles. To do
so, talk to the pit boss on the northern wall. From there you'll need to
decide which tier battle you wish to face in. You only have access to three
tiers at any given time. The higher the tier, the better prizes you can
win. However, each tier has an entrance fee which gets higher and higher
with each tier, their fees being:
Tier 1--100G
Tier 2--500G
Tier 3--1000G
Tier 4--2000G
Tier 5--5000G
Tier 6--10000G

With your basic smidge you will have access to tiers 1, 2, and 3. When your
smidge upgrades to a different class, you'll have access to only tiers 2,
3, and 4. When it reaches a second tier monster, you'll have access the
battle tiers 3, 4, and 5. To have only access to tiers 4, 5, and 6, your
monster much be at a third tier in a class and the leader of your party
must be at least level 38.

When requesting a fight, you can either partake in a Prize Match or an
Interdimensional Battle. Let's focus on the Prize Matches for the moment.
After choosing this option you will have to choose the tier you wish to
fight in. The ones you have access to are mentioned above, as well as their
entrance fees.

Once you're all set your monster will head off to the Arena for battle. In
combat, well, you have no control over what your monster does. The ATB will
fill up as usual for both opponents, and when it is full your monster will
take an action. If you do not assist it at all in combat it will always use
a normal attack.

However, you'll obviously will want to assist in in combat. You will be
able to give your monster an item in battle. The eight items are the same
as the ones you can give your monster when it goes out to train. Their
affects are:
Slops--Restores about 15% of your HP
Flameclaw--Use a Fire Tech
Seafang--Use a Water Tech
Duskeye--Use a Shadow Tech
Luxwing--Use a Light Tech
Hawk Talon--Boosts Strength by 5 briefly
Shield Cloak--Reduces physical damage by 1/3rd briefly
Feral Wrath--Critical hits do 4 times as much damage instead of 2 briefly

While in battle you can choose an item to hand to your monster at any time.
You can hand as many items as you want to your monster, but it can only
hold one at a time. If you give it a second item and it hasn't used the
first one yet, the first one will disappear forever. Use items to gain the
advantage in combat. However, keep in mind that the chances of your monster
using its item is based on its Trust stat. At low Trust your monster will
rarely use its held item. At high Trust your monster will almost always use
its item as soon as the ATB fills.

Early on in battles with your weak monster you'll likely need to use Slops
and Shield Cloaks to avoid getting brutally murdered. Once your monster's
stats start increasing, and perhaps a class change occurs, you will likely
rarely need to rely on items to get your way through battles. Keep in mind
as well that enemy monsters are capable of using all of the items that you
are capable of using.

Also, on the subject of items, the items that make your monster use a Tech
must match its affinity. If you want to have the monster use a particular
Shadow Tech, you must hand it the Duskeye in battle. Handing it a Seafang,
or any other Tech item, will simply confuse your monster if it uses the
item and its turn will be completely wasted.

Every five to seven battles you will encounter a boss monster. You'll
encounter Ouroboros in tier 1, R-70Y and Deathguard in tier 2, Dokra and
Uberhulk in tiers 3, 4, and 5, and Ice Demon in tier 6. These bosses have a
lot more HP then the regular monsters you face in their tiers, and are thus
a bit harder to take down. You won't have a higher chance of getting a good
reward from beating them, however...

There are six prizes unique to the Arena of the Ages, and unavailable
anywhere else in the game. These items can only be obtained from beating
the boss monsters. However, the odds of getting one of them from a boss is
very, very low.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       ~11F.Interdimensional Battle~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternatively you can have a free battle against a friend's monster. All
you need is a buddy with a DS and monster data in one of his files in the
Arena of the Ages. Both players will need to pick an open tier for them to
fight in (yes, you've gotta pay the damn fee), then one of you will need to
host a challenge while the other person accepts the challenge.

Once the battle starts it's exactly like a regular battle. You can still
assist your monster with the items, and you don't have true control on your
monster's actions. This mode is simply for bragging rights that you've
raised a better monster than your friend.

                             ~11G.Prize Lists~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the listings of all the prizes you can win in the various tiers. As
a note, the five mirrors and Nu Arcana can only be won from the boss
monsters, and even then you have an absurdly low chance of them turning up
as the prize. They can be won from every tier, but again, only from boss
monsters.

                             ~12.Extras Menu~
===========================================================================
Briefly mentioned in the New Game + and Extras section, this final section
of the guide expands on all of the various aspects of the Extras menu, how
to fully 100% every facet of it, and so on and so forth.

Filling up everything here is pretty much the final goal of 100%ing the
entire game. For the record, and it likely goes without saying, completing
everything in the Extras menu will take a long time, craptons of patience,
and likely multiple playthroughs of the game. It's literally impossible to
complete everything in a single playthrough of the game. Two, I believe,
is the absolute minimum. Take your sweet time obtaining everything because
it is going to be a long road.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               ~12A.Theater~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This part of the Extras menu allows you to view the various in-game
cinematics that you have seen. There are a total of ten of them, and the
first nine you'll acquire without difficulty if you simply progress through
the story (the only way you can miss the videos is if they either aren't
turn on in the options menu while playing the game, or you somehow beat
Lavos before completing the main story).

These are the same videos that were added to the PSX port. The tenth video,
however, is all new to the game and can only be obtained through one of the
new areas added to Chrono Trigger DS.

001-Reflections

002-Robo in Disrepair
Obtained by discovering Robo in the Proto Dome in 2300 AD

notes you need the Dreamstone to repair the Masamune)

reassembled Masamune in hand

                              ~12B.Art Gallery~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a collection of concept art by the designers. You unlock just about
all of the art as you meet the characters that the art depicts. Nothing too
special is required whatsoever. You'll unlock all of the art with ease if
you go for Ending 1 on your first playthrough.

A few of these I'm clueless as to when they're obtained, and there isn't a
list on the internet I can find that says when they're all obtained, so the
majority of these are just assumptions. The point still stands that going
for Ending 1 obtaines almost all of the art, if not all of it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section every Tech in the game you have unlocked is listed with a
description of the attack, who it hits, who uses it, MP cost, and the
character(s) involved in the Tech, as well as a neat picture to go along
with the diagram. The same order is listed in this section so you can find
which Techs you're missing.

The description will not be listed here since they're moderately pointless,
however the effect of the attack and what it does will remain listed here.
The type of magic it uses and the # of enemies/allies the attack hits will
be listed, though. Also, the single Techs will have the amount of TP needed
to unlock it for the character. Remember this is NOT cumulative TP. If a
Tech takes 200 TP to unlock, you don't get it when you collect 200 TP over
the course of the game. You need to have unlocked every Tech before this
particular one, then get another 200 TP to unlock the Tech.

Also, any special notes about the Tech will be listed. For Dual and
Triple Techs, the single Techs needed for each character participating in
the Tech will be listed.

For example, the Ice Sword II Dual Tech requires Marle to have Ice II and
Crono to have Frenzy. To learn the Dual Tech, both of them must have their
respective Techs and must complete a single battle with both in the same
party. Not terribly hard to accomplish.

Also of note, if a Single Tech does not have a TP Requirement, then the
character either starts with that move or learns it from Spekkio (in the
case of the basic magic attacks).

chest on your way through the cavern.

Gemstone as their accessory. After completing The Hero's Grave sidequest
to the point where the Masamune has its full power, put Frog as the leader
of your party and go to Denadoro Mountains. Climb up it a little bit until
you first find a Freelancer throwing rocks at you. Face the Freelancer and
wait. After a few rocks hit Frog he should grab one that ends up being the
Golden Gemstone. It may take a little while before he grabs it. Be patient.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               ~12E.Besitary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's exactly the same as the Bestiary within the game. This is
naturally a list of every enemy in game you have encountered. Filling it up
can be a goal of yours, and several enemies are annoying or practically
impossible to find without some sort of guide.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            ~12Ea.Listed Enemies~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A basic grid chart of all the normal enemies in the game. Listed is their
HP, Exp, TP, treasure that may be obtained by killing them, the item 
obtained when Charmed by Ayla, and their location. Several foes are likely 
impossible to find even if you go to their location or have some special 
catch to them. See the Special Enemy Notes section a bit below this one.

As a note, for Locations there are often more than one location you can 
find a particular enemy. I can only list one due to the amount of room I
have, but just keep in mind that some foes can be found in multiple areas.
Also, locations, Treasure, and Charmed Items may be abbreviated to fit the
small grid as well. Simplicity purposes, sorry. They'll be very shortened
if I have to put the era as well, since several locations, such as Guardia
Forest, exist in mulitple eras.

If a field is blank then the enemy doen't have any of it. Such as Treasure-
if it's blank then the enemy has no treasure. I hope that was obvious
already.

Bosses. For those who don't feel like searching for the place where I 
describe them in the actual walkthrough.
===========================================================================
159-Yakra
HP-920
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-50/TP-5/G-600

Techs:              Counters:
Scratch             Yakra Rage
Iron Sphere Blast
Needle Spin
Yakra Rumble

Location--Manolia Cathedral
----------------------------
If you fought almost all of the enemies in the cathedral, and have some
Potions, you should be capable of taking down Yakra. He has low Magic
Defense, just like most bosses in the game. Magic based Techs (at the end
of their description will be a magic symbol, like a fireball, shining
light, or a water drop) deal more damage than regular attacks and non-magic
Techs. Primarily use these attacks. Unless you really grinded, Lucca's 
Flamethrower (about 50 damage) and Lucca/Crono's Dual Tech Fire Whirl 
(about 110 damage) are your only magic moves. Use those attacks. Frog's 
duty is to Attack when everyone's in good shape, and use Slurp when 
someone gets low on HP and Ethers when MP is getting low on Crono/Lucca. 
Using X-Strike (Frog and Crono's Double Tech) does about 150 damage. It's 
also a good move.

If you attack Yakra and the initial attacker (such as if you used a Double
Tech with Lucca and Crono, and you chose the Tech from Lucca's menu) is
standing far from Yakra, he'll counter with a move that harms your entire
party. It does about 15 damage to everyone, but it adds up fast. Needle
Spin is a particuarily damaging attack, wasting away about 1/3rd one of
your members' HP. 

Use Athenian Waters if anyone faints, and Potions for everyone if multiple
members are at low HP. It should only take about 7 X-Strikes/Fire Whirls
and Yakra will fall. Not a hard battle unless you are very underleveled.

Head-Defense-0/Magic Defense-80
Wheel-Defense-120/Magic Defense-60
Body-Defense-160/Magic Defense-60
Exp-40/TP-5/G-500

Magic:
Head is Immune to Fire and Light

Head Techs:
Dragonfire (Fire tech)
Repair Body

Wheel Techs:
Dragon Charge

Body Techs:
Missiles
Body Counters:
Laser (Shadow tech)

Location--Prison Towers
----------------------------
An incredibly annoying fight if you're unlucky. If you read the note the 
warden had, you already know that you should simply attack the Head of the
Dragon Tank with non-magic Techs. Crono's Cyclone Tech and Lucca's normal 
attack is best to use against the Head.

The Head is really obnoxious as it can heal all body parts about 70 HP. The
annoying part is it can use this multiple times in a row if you're unlucky.
Every few attacks the wheels will store a charge. A turn or two later the
Dragon Tank will charge at you, dealing over 40 damage to your team. 

Overall, kill the Head first because of it's repair ability. This can be
practically impossible if it spams the hell out of Repair Body. It can heal
twice before Crono can use Cyclone, and Cyclone at this point can only do
about 150 damage. So you essentially aren't dealing damage to it if the
tank spams its heal ability. During this time, have Lucca heal herself and
Crono, and restore his MP for Cyclone when it gets low. 

Once the Head is finally destroyed, things get much easier. Blast the Body
with Fire Whirl, Wind Slash, and Flamethrower. When the Body is killed,
finish off what little HP the Wheel has to win the battle.

163, 164-Guardian
Guardian HP-1200/Pod HP-200
Guardian-Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Pod-Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-300/TP-5/G-1000

Magic:                        Guardian Techs:
Guardian is Immune to Fire    Revive Pods

Pod Techs:                    Guardian/Pod Combos:
Missile                       Amplifier (Shadow Tech)
Laser (Shadow Tech) 

Guardian/Pod Combo Counters:
Amplifier (Shadow Tech)
Delta Attack (Shadow Tech)

Location--Arris Dome
----------------------------
A really easy fight if you know what to do. If you don't, you're going to
be killed in seconds. Essentially, do not attack the Guardian at all. You
must kill the two Pods first, otherwise they will annihilate your party.
If both Pods are still up, the Delta Attack counter used when Guardian is
hurt will easily do about 100 damage to your whole team. Amplifier, used
when only one Pod is left as well as sometimes as a normal attack, does
about 50 damage to one of your characters.

Obviously enough you need to kill the pair of Pods. They have little HP, so
it will only take a few Flamethrowers and Wind Slashes to take each down.
Make sure Marle heals the party whenever necessary. Once both Pods are 
down you can freely attack the Guardian. After an attack or two it will
start counting down from 5. It'll likely attack you every now and then, but
it won't be terribly strong. 

When the counter reaches 0, the Pods will get revived and you'll need to
repeat the process of destroying them. You should be able to kill the
Guardian the second time you destroy the Pods if you're at a good level and
you're using Wind Slash, or other strong Techs. Keep in mind that it
absorbs Fire Techs, so Flamethrower is useless against the Guardian.

165-Krawlie
HP-500
Defense-157/Magic Defense-50
Exp-100/TP-5/G-500

Magic:
Weak to Water

Techs:
Doublehand Slap
Mash (Sets HP to 1)

Location--Abandoned Sewers
----------------------------
Joke boss. A few simple attacks will suffice to kill him. Setting your HP
to 1 is annoying, but he rarely uses that and he shouldn't use it more than
once by the time he's killed.
===========================================================================

===========================================================================
166-R-Series (six of them)
HP-150
Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Exp-80/TP-1/G-100

Magic:   
Weak against Light

Techs:                        Counters:
Robo Punch                    Robo Laser (Shadow Tech)
Robo Cable Punch              Robo Pitch
                              Robo Explosion

Location--Derelict Factory
----------------------------
Pretty annoying boss fight if you're underleveled, not to mention you lose
Robo for the fight. If you have Marle, she'll primarily be healing the
group. If you have Lucca, both of you will occasionally need to use Mid-
Potions, but the pair of you can unleash a lot of damage with powerful
Techs and end the battle fast.

Of note is that they are weak to Light magic, so Crono's Wind Slash (try to
select an enemy that has an enemy also in the line of fire that also gets
hit by the blast) will do a lot of damage. Lucca's Flamethrower as well.
Marle can't really do much to these guys.

Mainly focus on one of them at a time. Individually they won't cause a ton
of damage, but all six attacking you, each doing around 25 damage, adds up
very quickly. Don't worry about those counters--they are hardly used 
(although they all do around 50 damage if you see them, primarily used when
the group is down to one or two foes left). 

Once you get down to about two or three of them the remainder of the fight
gets considerable easier, and you'll be poised for victory.

167-Heckran
HP-2100
Defense-253/Magic Defense-50
Exp-250/TP-10/G-1500

Techs:                        Counters:
Water (Water Tech)            Water II (Water Tech)
Yah!                          
Nereid Cyclone (Water Tech)   

Location--Heckran Cave
----------------------------
That beastly Defense is nothing to scoff at. You'll struggle to deal more
than single digit damage with regular attacks, so stick with your magic
Techs. Don't use Dual Techs here--damage output with individual single
magic Techs outweighs damage with magic Dual Techs.

Nereid Cyclone and Yah! are dangerous attacks, and can easily lower one of
your party member's HP by half. Keep Mid-Potions on hand, or heal with 
Marle if she's in your party.

Midway through the fight Heckran will state "Go ahead and attack, see what
it gets you!" and change stances. Obviously, don't attack him. He'll 
counterattack with the powerful Water II Tech. Use this time to heal your 
party. When he gives up his gambit by disengaging his counterattack stance,
resume pounding him with magic Techs. It's not a very hard fight. None of 
his attacks, save the easily avoidable Water II move when he's in 
counterattack mode, will hit the entire party. 
===========================================================================

168-Ozzie
HP-762
Defense-127/Magic Defense-100
Exp-30/TP-2/G-100

Magic:
Immune to all elements

Techs:
Lightning (Light Tech)

Location--Zenan Bridge
----------------------------
Impossible to kill realistically unless you're on a New Game +. He never
attacks, so he's just standing there...doing nothing to impose you.

169, 170-Zombor
Upper Body HP-960/Lower Body HP-800
Upper Body Defense-127/Magic Defense-50
Lower Body Defense-175/Magic Defense-50
Exp-350/TP-10/G-1500

Magic:
Upper Body absorbs Light and Fire
Lower Body absorbs Water and Shadow

Upper Body Techs:                    Counters:
Flame Strike (Fire Tech)             Annihilation Ray
Annihilation Ray                     MP Buster (reduces MP to 0)     
Drain (heals based on damage dealt)  
Fangs

Lower Body Techs:
Skull Drop
Earthquake

Location--Zenan Bridge
----------------------------
Each part of the body gets healed by two different magic types. Don't use
hit all magic Techs as you'll just end up healing one of the parts of the
body. Start with the Lower Body first as it has fewer HP. Lucca and Crono
are capable of pounding on the Lower Body, and will drain its HP with
Lightning and Fire really fast. 

It should only take a few attacks to kill the Lower Body. By now you'll
probably have been hit by Zombor's Annihilation Ray, which deals around 90
damage to your entire party. It's quite devastating, so spend a turn 
healing or use Marle's healing Techs to get everyone back to high HP.

Once everyone gets back to high HP, finish off the Lower Body. The Upper
Body is only weak to Robo's Shadow Techs. Everyone else should use normal
attacks or magicless Techs. Don't forget to keep healing when Annihilation
Ray gets used, and you'll get through the battle without too much of an
issue.

Location--Denadoro Mountains
----------------------------
The first part of the fight is insanely easy, so don't waste a ton of MP
getting through it. All you need to do is drain one of their HP's to 0. 
Not both of them. Masa and Mune are individually insanely weak, with only
a few magic Techs draining their health. They'll counterattack with 
X-Strike every time you hit one of them, but it only does a pitiful 35 or 
so damage by now. As you could probably guess the battle won't be this 
easy.

They'll merge into the bizarre looking Masa & Mune. The giant creature has
a lot more health, so taking it down will be tougher. Stick with your magic
Techs as usual as they'll cause a lot more damage than non-magic attacks.
The fight isn't particuarily hard--Masa & Mune's attacks mainly hit only
one of your characters, but beware when you get the notice it's storing
whirlwind energy. Heal up your party before they use Vacuum Wave. This
attack does around 120 damage to your entire party. Very, very bad. Heal
up right away.

Masa & Mune's other attacks only do about 50 damage to one character, as
mentioned. You can work-around this as Marle or Robo can easily heal up 
that damage, and Mid-Potions get the job done too. Just heal before and 
after Vacuum Wave and you won't have a terribly hard time with this 
slightly tedious, but simple, boss fight.

----------------------------
Nothing you do will hurt him for more than 10 damage until you use
Lightning on him. This will severely reduce his Defense, allowing you to
strike him. Magic Defense also gets lowered. At this point all you honestly
need to do is pound the hell out of him.

Use Robo's Robo Tackle and Crono and Ayla's Dual Tech Drill Kick. By this
time he will use Electric Discharge which will do a huge amount of damage
to your party (nearly 200 to everyone). Spend the following turn healing
up, then use Lightning again to lower his Defenses and repeat the process.

Earthquake hits everyone for light damage, while Charge does twice as much
damage to only one character. Overall it's a pathetically easy fight as
Nizbel attacks for about every six attacks you use. Yeah. This isn't very
hard. Just heal up after Electric Discharge and it'll be simple.

Location--Fiendlord's Keep
----------------------------
Really annoying fight. Against Flea?, hit it with any attack from any party
member. Whichever character strikes Flea? will lose all their MP from the
MP Buster counter. You should make it Crono since he attacks first, and
when the next fight commences he can heal MP right away.

As you may expect, the real Flea will appear now (and yes, the bat that was
following you around was Flea). She (he?) has all status inflicting
attacks, all of which are incredible annoying. Be sure to have Panaceas on
hand to heal the bad effects like Sleep and Confuse.

All of Flea's attacks do moderate damage. Hence why this isn't a terribly
hard fight. Despite low Magic Defense, magic Techs do about half as much
damage as physical attacks. Thusly, ignore magic based Techs. You'll need
to heal often throughout the fight because she constantly attacks, and the
damage builds up quickly. Don't forget that Robo and Frog have healing
moves too (so does Marle, but she sucks for combat). If you have trouble,
get Robo to learn the Heal Beam Tech, which heals the entire party a bit.
It's really useful if you have it.

And be wary of her occasional The Look counter. It'll deal about 100 damage
to everyone, so be sure to keep everyone above 100 HP at all times to avoid
potential knockouts from the move.

Location--Fiendlord's Keep
----------------------------
Unarmed Slash has a few attacks, all of which deal around 70 damage to a
single member of the party, except for Firebomb which will strike everyone.
Like the Flea fight, don't waste energy on magic Techs. Physical Techs do
well over twice as much damage as them. This guy isn't too hard due to a
lack of attacks, and he won't attack terribly often.

Of course he'll pull out his sword, making the fight a lot harder. Same
tactics as usual--keep spamming the high powered physical Techs for
maximum damage output. He will still make long pauses between attacks. His
Wind Slash can hit everybody if he attacks from one of the bottom corners
of the room. All of his moves will continue to deal about 70 damage to
your party, except for Cleave (dealing well over 100), but be wary now that
he can strike multiple members at once with ease.

Frenzy does a lot of damage as well, but he doesn't use it very often (save
for common counters when he gets low on HP). You shouldn't need to do as
much healing as in the Flea fight, but continue to never let your HP get
too low due to those strong 100+ damage moves he has.

                            Dark Bomb (Shadow Tech)

Location--Fiendlord's Keep
----------------------------
This guy is hard. And if you don't know what to do, he'll obliterate your
team in no time. Be prepared to heal constantly through this fight.
Alright, as you can tell from his insane Defense, magic Techs are going to
be the way to go. However, he will counterattack if you hit him with any
magic attack save one type. He switches his type weakness (you're alerted
to it) every now and then.

However, to get through quickly you'll need to lower his Magic Defense.
Strike him with a normal attack from Frog. The Masamune has to be equipped
for it to work (if for some reason it's not equipped then this isn't going
to happen. Why would you unequip it anyway?).

Use a normal attack and a message appears saying which magic types are
being absorbed. The one that can hurt him will be noted. Hit him with only
that type. Everyone else should stick to physical attacks. He changes
barrier types each time he is hit by an attack. Each time the barrier
changes he will counterattack with the magic attack he is not absorbing
(if he's weak to Light he'll counter with Lightning II, for example).

This makes the fight incredibly annoying as he will constantly be harming
everyone for 100+ damage. Robo should be spamming Heal Beam throughout the
whole battle. You will need to hit him with the Masamune again to lower his
Magic Defense every few attacks. If you need the chance to heal, and you
will want to do so often, simply stop hitting him. He won't use his strong
counterattacks that way.

So, yeah, knowing this the first half of the fight is simply very
repetitive, but nothing too terrible if you can keep everyone healed up.
However, once Magus gets down to about 4000 HP, he will lower his defenses
to begin casting a spell. All magic types hit him, and physical attacks do
good damage. You'll want to focus on getting everyone back to near max HP
before barraging him, though.

All he will do now is cast Dark Matter, the ultimate Shadow Tech. It's
insanely powerful, easily dealing 250+ damage to everyone. Spend a few
moves healing everyone again, then resume smacking Magus around. When Magus
gets into this phase the battle is pretty much won, as the ONLY thing he
uses will be Dark Matter every six or so moves. Just keep yourself healed
and nothing will be a problem.

If you have trouble with the first stage of the fight, don't forget you
have Barrier Spheres in your inventory. They're only temporary, but the
extra resistance against Magus's strong magic attacks could help you if you
are underleveled.

Electric Discharge (Light Tech)
Earthquake

Location--Tyranno Lair
----------------------------
Use Lightning (II) on Nizbel to severely lower his Defense. The trick to
this fight is that every time he is attacked his Defense will increase a
little bit again. Use a Lightning attack for every few attacks your
partners use.

All of his attacks deal around 50 damage. He has the annoying poison-
inducing counter, but it's rarely, rarely used. Electric Discharge is the
biggie. That sucker does nearly 200 damage to your entire party. He uses
this move every three times you use Lightning/II, so try to limit your
usage of those two moves so you don't keep getting hit by this attack.

Past Electric Discharge this fight is just as easy as the previous Nizbel 
fight. He's not terribly challenging. Just has a lot of HP to deplete, but 
Robo's Heal Beam or any other healing moves/items will suffice every few 
turns. Just remember not to spam the Lightning moves to avoid many 
Electric Discharges.

Telepathy (Sleep)

Black Tyranno Techs:
Fire Breath (Fire Tech)
Chomp (Absorbs HP)
Roar
Tyranno Flame (Fire Tech)

Location--Tyranno Lair
----------------------------
Not a terribly hard fight. You will want to off Azala as quickly as
possible to make the fight a lot simpler. Use only magic Techs on Azala as
your physical moves won't dent her very much. Simply ignore the Black
Tyranno until Azala is defeated. Both of them will attack occasionally,
everything dealing around 60 damage to your characters. Black Tyranno will
use fire-based attacks, so those Ruby Vests will come in handy.

Once Azala is defeated, don't do anything. Heal until you receive the
message "Lowering Defense and begins storing power.". Once that appears, go
all out on Black Tyranno. The boss will never attack you at this point, but
make sure everyone has 350+ HP anyway. Black Tyranno will count down
from 5 to 0. Once it hits 0, it'll unleash Tyranno Flame which harms
everyone for well over 300 HP. It's insane.

After the attack, heal and wait for the message again, then continue
spamming high powered physical Techs. Falcon Strike is a good choice here.
Ayla and Crono should have learned it if you didn't run from many fights.
At average levels, you should be able to kill the BT in the middle of the
third countdown.

Location--Zeal Palace (and Ocean Palace when fighting the pair of them)
----------------------------
The easiest way to finish the battle is to get killed. It IS possible to
win, it's just really hard. The Golem copies your attacks, essentially.
A thing to note is that several of its copied attacks are really weak. Both
Water II and Ice are insanely weak. If you use just those moves and keep
healing, it's not too bad a fight. Using magic Dual Techs, like Thunder
Chomp, work too. The order of damage his attacks inflict are as follows:
Physical > Shadow > Light > Fire > Water/Ice
Try to avoid hitting him with any physical moves. His Physical Copy attack
deals 400+ damage to a single party member.

Golem spams Iron Sphere, reducing the HP of whoever it hits in half. And it
really spams this. A lot. Hence why you'll probably lose. A good thing to
note is that Lucca's Hypnowave actually works on this boss. Use that to get
a few free attacks in, then put it back to sleep. Spam until victory. The
reward is quite nice, but the outcome is the same regardless.

Location--Mudbeast Den
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. Like I said before, Lucca and Frog are the
advised partners. Their magic Techs will help greatly in this fight.
Despite what he does, ignore the Mud Imp. He has crazy high Defense and
Magic Defense, and taking him down while both Mudbeasts are alive is quite
challenging.

Playing their weaknesses is key. Frog and Lucca, when they attack the Red
and Blue Mudbeast respectively, can score about 500+ damage with a strong
magic Tech. Crono should heal anyone who takes too much damage, and stick
to single target Techs. Otherwise they will use the powerful Cross Charge
or Earthquake counter, and those are quite powerful.

The Mud Imp likes to spam his healing move. It heals everyone about 150 HP,
which isn't too much for the beasts but a ton for the Imp considering his
high defenses. Save him for last, then swamp him with everything you have
when the Mudbeasts fall. He won't last too long when he can't hop on
anything to charge over you. Physical attacks are far superior than magic
attacks against him. He also loves spamming his heal move after every
attack, so keep using physical Techs and he'll be down fast.

You will likely need to use a ton of healing items through the fight, but
just be patient. It'll take a lot of magic attacks to take everything down.

Location--Mountain of Woe
----------------------------
An incredibly easy fight. Of course some of you can't figure out the whole
"if something besides the main boss is on the screen kill them damn things
first" concept in Chrono Trigger (hell, 90% of RPG's in general), hence why
you probably got killed by this thing real fast.

Kill the damn Arms first. It's really easy. Two, possibly three, Falcon
Strikes (Ayla and Crono's Dual Tech) destroy those things. Two Twisters
(Crono/Ayla/Robo's Triple Tech) rape them AND Giga Gaia at the same time
for 1700+ damage.

Oh...fine. Some of you like a challenge. Some of you didn't kill all of the
Rubbles (what the hell is wrong with you?). In this case, note that the
Attack Arm is far more lethal than the Defense one. At a wimpy 2000 HP, you
can wipe that out with a few strong physical attacks.

With the painful arm out of the way, focus your attention to the Defense
Arm. Its attacks are very weak, hence why you'd want to kill it second
rather than first. It'll fall just as quickly as the Attack Arm. When both
arms are down you can freely attack Giga Gaia's head without worry of any
counterattack. He can't attack without his hands, so pummel away. Have one
of your partners heal the several hundred HP damage the hands dealt to
your party. Robo's Heal Beam is good for this task.

After a few attacks Giga Gaia will regenerate his hands and you'll need to
repeat the simple process of destroying them. Repeat until the head lives
no more. I believe that when the Arms are respawned they have less HP than
initially started with (around 1500 HP or so. Not entirely sure). It makes
things a bit easier.

This battle is a joke. He counters with Iron Sphere after every single

----------------------------
Dalton is still a joke fight. Be careful when attacking, though. He
counters all physical moves with Iron Sphere and all magic Techs with
moves of the opposite type (Use Fire and he will use Water, use Shadow and
he uses Light).

Just avoid physical moves because Iron Sphere drains HP more than anything
else. His HP is still really low, so it should only take a few attacks to
do him in. Robo and Ayla's Double Tech, Beast Toss, nearly one hit KO's
Dalton. Use it if you have it.

You fight Magus if you choose to do so when you talk to him. If Frog is in
your party, he'll opt to go solo on this battle against him. He's insanely
easy now since he doesn't have that magic barrier, he has no Shadow attacks
to use, and at this point his attacks should do minimal damage against you.
Very easy fight. Only do this if you wish to get him in your Bestiary as
Magus is a cool partner.

Not a terribly hard fight. All you need to do is kill the Mouth to win the

Location--Sunken Desert
----------------------------
An annoying boss fight, for sure. What you want to do first is use a Water/
Ice Tech on the boss, and if it's not a hit-all then aim for the Core
first. Water/Ice Techs weaken their Defense much like the other foes in
this desert. With the Core's Defense down, a few physical attacks will
easily kill it.

This way the remaining body cannot heal itself throughout the fight. The
trick is that its Defense goes up a bit when attacked, so you'll need to
keep using a Water/Ice Tech to weaken it again. You'll want to focus on the
Lower Body first as it has less HP, so it can be killed faster.

The head has a lot of attacks, but they mainly only hit one party member
while the lower half can hit the entire party easier. That makes it more
dangerous. And it goes without saying that you will have a much easier time
with the fight when only the Upper Body remains the fight becomes much
easier. Keep yourself healed and you can easily win at that point.

----------------------------
Oh boy. You're not going to have fun with this fight. Your first priority
should be Charming everyone's unique items (Flea Bustier, Slasher II,
Ozzie Pants). The thing is, after every attack, and that includes Charm,
they'll use their Triple Tech, Delta Force. It does around 300 damage to
whoever it hits, but that's still quite powerful. The way it works is the
amount of members it hits is the same as the amount of foes you hit. Hit
all three, all three party members get hurt. Hit one, and it's just one
that's hurt. Don't use any hit-all moves. You'll quickly regret it.

You should kill Diva Flea first. She doesn't use those status inflicting
moves too often, but you're in for a world of hurt if she dares use them.
It still takes only a few attacks for her to fall, so it shouldn't be too
much trouble if you hurry and have someone keep the party healed from their
Delta Force move.

They can't use Delta Force with one member missing, making the rest of the
fight much easier. They pretty much stop using powerful attacks now, so
a few more bashes against the remaining two bosses and it'll be over. For
the record, Ozzie has no attacks other than his partner counters. Saving
him for last is definitely best.

And not the Metroid kind. Simply put the fight is insanely easy. Use a hit-
all attack to destroy the three Displays and harm Mother Brain, then go
all out on her. With pathetic HP like that she doesn't last very long. Its
strongest attacks deal about 100 damage to everyone's, so the fight should
not last more than a minute.

Prominence Techs:
Flame Counterattack (Fire Tech)

Location--Sun Temple
----------------------------
A simple to understand fight. You will be wanting high Magic Defense units
as everything here is magic based. If your team has Ruby Armor or stuff
like Red Plates, you'll either reduce damage from Fire attacks, or absorb
them completely, making the fight that much easier. Actually, the battle
is nearly impossible with Fire-reducing armor. Seriously, you'll be raped
likely before you can damage the damn thing one bit.

Now, the objective of the fight is merely to kill Son of the Sun. However,
he cannot be hurt normally. To harm him, you must hit one of the five
Prominences. Only one of them will harm Son of the Sun, and the other four
will hit you with Flame Counterattack. The Prominence that harms Son of the
Sun will always harm him until he uses Roulette Spin, at which point you
will need to keep trying to find which one hurts him.

The reason damage output is irrelevant is because each correct Prominence
hit does ~215 damage to Son of the Sun, no matter what. An alternative to
finding which Prominence harms Son of the Sun is to use a hit-all move. The
Promy that doesn't make an attack is obviously the one that hurts him.
However, you'll be facing five counterattacks if you do so. It's advised
to just use regular attacks as, again, damage output does not matter. It
takes about 11 hits to kill him (yes, I'm aware that's only about 4500 HP
worth of damage. I'm actually on the train of thought the battle merely
ends after a certain amount of turns as that is simply too short).

----------------------------
Another really easy fight. Much like the Black Tyranno fight, he basically
just counts down from 5 to 0 and then uses Tyranno Flame, doing a crapton
of damage to your party. Of course, if you've got the Red Plate and Vests
equipped the damage is practically nullified. If you don't, you will likely
need to heal a bit after the attack. It's not a hard fight, and he does not
use Chomp all too much (although that itself does a decent amount of
damage too).

Location--Guardia Castle (1000 AD)
----------------------------
He likes to spam Miasma, so having status immunity equipment equipped is
probably for the best. His main attacks can also hurt your team quite a
bit, especially his Needle Spin. It can do a crazy amount of damage to
someone in your party. He also rarely uses Yakra Rumble, and it does a
good amount of damage to your whole party.

Be sure that when you land the final blow your entire party has a good
amount of HP. He uses his barrage attack when killed, harming everyone in
your team. If you all die from that then the battle will have been for
naught.

----------------------------
Not a terribly hard boss. It should only take a few strong hit-all attacks
and both parts of the body will fall. If you've got status immunity armor
then only Tentacle (Strike) will be the remotely annoying attacks, and
even then they won't do a ton of damage. Hell, three strong hit-all magic
Techs should be enough to destroy everything without him getting a single
attack in. Pretty pathetic fight, really.

Use just magic attacks against these guys. Obviously with Defense like that
your regular attacks aren't going to get you very far. All of its attacks
are insanely weak. You really shouldn't have a ton of trouble with this
guy. Just be sure to heal if Life Shaver gets used by the Lower Body. The
lower half should be killed off quickly, making that an unlikely-to-see
attack, but you never know.

----------------------------
Now this fight is actually annoying. It's practically impossible to kill
the Lower Body. Good job if you do. All you need to do is kill the Upper
Body. Don't use any hit-all attacks as the Lower Body will stuff the
attacker's HP down to 1. That's not good given the Upper Body's large array
of moves.

However, magic Triple Techs are effective, like Twister. Although it'll
feed off of the Lower Body to restore some health, spamming such a move
will kill the Upper Body after a few turns. It's a good last resort if
nothing else is doing more than 100 damage. The Lower Body doesn't counter
the Triple Tech, luckily.

Yeah this fight isn't terribly difficult. Just slam on her with everything
you've got. Her attacks are pathetically weak, except for the near OHKO
Halation move. Oh, best part about that move is that it affects your entire
damn party. Well, that's what charming 30 or so Megalixirs was for. Better
put those suckers to good use. Alternatively, this perfectly sets up Ayla's
Dino Tail and Frog's Frog Squish, Techs that deal more damage the lower 
Ayla and Frog's HP is respectively. Use those attacks before healing if 
either of them are in your party. Robo's Heal Beam also works in getting
everyone to safe HP. As long as everyone has 200+ you should be fine.

Location--Black Omen
----------------------------
Okay, this is an odd fight. Each time you hit the Mammon Machine with a
physical attack, it will increase its Defense. Each time it is hit with a
magic attack, it will increase its Attack power. Eventually it will
discharge this energy with Energy Discharge, doing a considerable amount of
damage to your party.

You're better off using powerful magic attacks. Each time it turns magic
into Attack power, that uses up an attack. It'll not use Stand Still or
Point Flare if you make it convert energy. Basically, you keep attacking
the Mammon Machine and Energy Discharge is pretty much the only thing that
will ever hit you. It stops converting energy after awhile, so keep going
all out on the machine after that, healing when necessary. Its attacks are
also considerable weak. You shouldn't need to heal often.

----------------------------
Wow, this is the real Queen Zeal? Hmm. The Face is the one you're trying to
kill. Don't you dare attack either of the hands. However, you should Charm
both of the hands to get a Prismatic Helm and Dress. They're pretty much
the best defensive equipment for males and females respectively. Get Ayla 
to do it now.

Once you're charmed the items, go all out with non-hit-all Techs against
the Face. As long as you don't ever attack the hands, their lone attacks
will never do considerable damage to your team. Hell, they probably won't
even do more than 20 damage.

Overall it's a simple fight. Besides the typical Halation, none of Queen
Zeal's attacks are particularly threatening.

Location--???
----------------------------
I suppose the point of this is to exclaim how awesome the extended Lavos
theme is. It's awesome. Really. The Boss Rush Form is insanely easy.
Basically, you're fighting ten previous bosses. At this point, none of
them should damage you much or take long to kill. If you need a quick
refresher on how to kill all of them, here you go:
(Note that you have time to heal between fights. To trigger the next boss
attack you'll need to walk into the Lavos head)

Dragon Tank--The Lavos head is the tank's head, the right bit is the wheel,
and left bit is the body. Kill the head first, then the wheels, then the
body.

Guardian--The two bits to the sides of Lavos are the Pods. Kill both of
them before attacking the Guardian (Lavos's head). Although at this point
you could just go Rambo on the head and their counterattack probably won't
harm you all that much.

Heckran--A few magic attacks is all that'll be needed to kill off the lone
boss.

Zombor--The bit infront of the head is the lower body, while Lavos's head
is the upper body. Kill the lower body first (Fire and Light techs are the
only magic types that can hit it), then Lavos's head (only Water and Shadow
magic types can hit it). Physical attacks also work here no matter what.

Masa & Mune--A few magic attacks is all that should be needed to finish
this fight off quickly. None of his attacks are damaging, except if he
charges energy and you somehow don't kill him in time (and even then it's
a pitiful amount of damage).

Nizbel--Use a Lightning attack to lower his defenses, then go all out on
him with powerful physical attacks. Shouldn't take too many of them before
the boss is killed.

Magus--Hitting him causes Lavos to change barriers. The attack he uses is
the magic type he is weak to (uses Fire II, he's weak to fire moves, and so
on). After a little bit of damage he'll lower his defenses completely to
charge for Dark Matter. Smash him with everything you've got to so you
hopefully won't have to endure the damage it causes.

Black Tyranno--The left bit is Azala. She needs to be killed first, and it
should only take a few magic moves to do so. Once killed, wait for the
message to appear saying "Lowers Defense and begins storing power". Go all
out on Lavos's head at this point. You should be able to kill it before
the countdown reaches 0 and the powerful magic attack Tyranno Flame gets
used.

Giga Gaia--The left and right pods represent Giga Gaia's hands. Use Falcon
Strike or a hit-all move to smash them off quickly, then go all out on
Giga Gaia. He doesn't have a ton of HP, so he should fall very quickly
after a few strong attacks.

After killing the last boss, you'll have one last chance to heal before you
fight Lavos for real.

----------------------------
Lavos starts right off using Destruction Rains from the Heavens, causing
massive damage to your entire team. He uses this move rarely from that
point on, so take the time to heal. Chaos Zone does very little damage, but
obviously causes confusion if you don't have one of those awesome status
effect-immunity armors/helms equipped.

Lavos Needle will do around 300 damage to a single member of the party, and
Earth Quake harms everyone for a moderate amount. There's honestly not much
else to say about this fight as you're just using your strongest attacks
against a single head.

Immobilize (Stop)

Location--Below Lavos's Shell
----------------------------
This fight is much, much harder. Lavos's nipple lasers activate right at
the start of the battle and it's impossible to get a move in before they
fire. This attack does twice as much damage as Destruction Rains from the
Heavens does. Immediately heal the damage, as like that move he uses his
lasers very, very rarely.

Now, both arms have the same attacks. The Right arm (Lavos's right, your
left) has lower HP, so naturally you will want to get that out of the way
first to ease the pain you'll be enduring through the fight. Powerful hit-
all attacks also work quite nicely, as they'll hit both arms for quite a
good amount of damage. Falcon Strike is great for hitting the arms as well,
and so are hit-all Triple Techs such as Twister.

When the Right Arm is down, focus on the Left Arm, naturally. If you had
been using hit-all attacks, its HP should be drained a bit already, so just
a little more and it will fall as well. The Arms don't get revived, so
pressure in this fight is definitely alleviated a bit when one is dead. The
nipple lasers also can't fire if one of the Arms is dead.

The remaining Arm will likely use its more annoying Techs now. Curse does a
decent amount of damage and nullfies status immunity to whoever it hits.
It'll likely follow up with Immobilize, so cure it with a Panacea quickly.

Once both Arms are killed, the Lavos Body will lower it's defenses. It'll
also now start using it's primary Techs. All of his attacks are quite
painful, and if he uses Evil Emanation you'll probably want to end the
fight not long after that (although by the time he uses it you should be
close to victory).

Dark Flame's Embrace is his strongest attack, and will probably one shot
someone on your team, if not everyone. It easily does 500+ damage to
everyone. Use Athenian Waters and Hi-Potions after the attack to get
everyone back to high HP.

Lavos generally loops through his Tech list, so he'll use a few weaker
Techs before going gung-ho on Dark Flame's Embrace. Use the time to stay
at high HP, and make sure you're still at high HP when you strike the
finishing blow.

Location--I have no idea
----------------------------
This is it. The Final Final Final Boss. And boy does it make little sense.
The small pod on the right is the actual Lavos Core. Once it dies, Lavos
is gone for good. Of course, draining its 30000 HP isn't going to be very
easy, and it has those insane defenses...

Firstly, you must destroy one of the other pods. Doesn't matter which. The
Lavos Pod has a mere 2000 HP, but it absorbs all magic attacks. Even so, a
single Frenzy Tech from Crono takes it down, and if you don't have that
then one or two physical Techs will destroy the pod.

In the interim, try damaging the Center Pod but don't waste a whole lot of
MP doing so. A little bit after destroying a pod, the Lavos Core will lower
its defenses in preparation for reviving the pods. Smack it with everything
you have. You can get 6-11 attacks in before the pods revive. When the pods
revive, the Lavos Core's defenses will still be lowered for a short period
of time, so don't stop attacking until the message saying it restores its
defenses appears. This process repeats until you've drained the Lavos 
Core's HP, and Lavos is no more.

As far as Lavos's attacks, they're strong. Very strong. The Core honestly
can't do much (thank goodness), and the Lavos Pod doesn't have terribly bad
attacks. It's the Center Pod and its high HP goodness that's the main
threat. It rarely uses its Ultimate Attacks, which totally obliterate your
team if hit. Heal right away, naturally. Hopefully you won't have been hit
by Curse so if you have status immune armor his Diabolic Whisper will be of
no effect. Demon Star is annoying, but a little healing can get past that.
Grandstone, Lavos's ultimate physical attack, is insanely powerful. It'll
do 500+ to your entire party, making it less threatening than Dreamreaver,
but the damage is so significant you'll want to heal right away.

Temporal Shift changes the background to that of a random era you've
visited. I'm not entirely sure what it does (nobody really is, actually).
I think it somewhat effects the Center Pod's attack pattern, and it
sometimes drains a little HP without the damage dealt appearing over your
head, usually just 5-25 of it. It's an odd move.

Don't be afraid to use any Megalixirs you've acquired through the
sidequests. Their effects are lifesavers in many situations, especially
after Dreamreaver, which is a team raper for sure. That move will do around
700+ damage to everyone. 

Ultimately, stay above 700 HP at all costs. I can say that with certainty--
as I'm writing this fight I lost when the core has but 800 HP left. And it
was Dreamraper that did me in. Don't let that happen to you. Not to
mention it just loves stacking on damage. Just stay at high HP and guzzle
down Megalixirs when in a pinch.

234-Goldhammer
HP-5800
Defense-220/Magic Defense-70
Exp-2000/TP-0/G-10000

Techs:                        Counters:
Gold Hammer                   Rush (Lowers HP to 1)
Boulder
Thrash

Location--Millennia Wood
----------------------------
Not a terribly hard fight. Goldhammer has pretty bulky defenses, so a lot
of your attacks won't be doing a huge amount of damage. The worst part
about the fight is that each time he gets hurt his attack power increases.
Thusly, ending the fight as quickly as possible with strong Techs, physical
or magical, is advised.

His base attacks don't do a ton of damage, but they become powerful
extremely fast if you keep hitting him with your own attacks. His Rush move
lowers the person it hits' HP to 1. He uses it when he is running low on
HP. Once he spams Rush as pretty much his only attack hurry up and finish
Goldhammer off.

235-Nu Guardian
HP-6100
Defense-200/Magic Defense-80
Exp-2500/TP-0/G-0

Techs:                     Counters:
Charge                     Luminaire (Light Tech)
Head-butt (Lowers to 1 HP) Dark Matter (Shadow Tech)
                           Flare (Fire Tech)
                           Ice II (Water Tech)
                           Hypnotize
                           Time Freeze

Location--Mount Emerald
----------------------------
Headbutt is the move all Nu's have, the one that knocks you to 1 HP. You
know the one. He'll counter all magic attacks with a magic counter of the
same type (although with Water he goes with Ice). If you use physical moves
he will do either Hypnotize or Time Freeze. Thusly, if you keep hitting him
with magic attacks he will never get the chance to use one of his normal
Techs.

That's for the best since Headbutt will ensure the next hit-all magic
attack he uses will murder whoever gets hit. Ice II is his weakest counter,
while Luminaire is his strongest. Avoid using light magic if you can.
Overall the fight will last awhile due to his insane defenses. There's not
much you can do about that. Just keep smacking him with magic attacks and
you'll never have to worry about Headbutt. Head whenever necessary.

Thunderburst (Light Tech)
Life Shaver (Sets HP to 1)
Death's Rainbow (Insta-kill)
Telekinesis
Overdrive

Location--Mount Emerald
----------------------------
The Nu Master is one hellishly annoying fight. Death's Rainbow, as you can
see, is an insta kill attack. He usually doesn't use it often. Usually.
Sometimes he does, sometimes you may never see it. Hope it's the latter.
You'll constantly be losing health as he'll counter moves with Drain
Health.

Robo is good for this battle and his Heal Beam. Devil's Drop is an annoying
to deal with attack, but it can be healed. He still has the "drop HP to 1"
attack. He uses that often from what I've seen. Telekinesis is crazy weak,
and I'm unsure what Overdrive does. Never seen him use it. It probably
raises his attack power or just does moderate damage to everyone. Stay
healed and you'll do fine.

Both Counters:
Osmose (Steals MP)

Location--Primeval Fortress
----------------------------
Get out a pad of paper because this is one annoying fight. The trick to
this fight is that when one of the Archaeofangs is killed, its partner
will revive it to full health. To win the fight you'll need to kill them
both before one can revitalize the other. This can be done by killing them
both with one attack, or by killing one then killing the other in one or
two moves (after that the remaining Archaeofang will have had time to use
Revive).

If you obtained the Blue Plate and Vest from the Sealed Chest sidequest,
they could be put to use here as those annoying Water Techs the Younger
has will be harmless. Now, the point of that pad of paper is to keep track
of how much damage you've done to each Archaeofang. First use the strongest
hit-all attack in your party. Let's say that attack does 1200 damage (for
simplicity's sake round damage to the nearest hundred).

Once you've dealt about 7000 damage to the elder and 6500 damage to the
Younger, bust out that 1200 damage hit-all attack to kill both foes at the
same time. That's the goal. You don't want the fight to stall out when they
use Soul Link.

Keep in mind that the Elder is the red one, and the Younger is the blue
one. As for their attacks, they aren't *terribly* powerful. They do about
100 damage each, but they use them constantly since there's two of them.
Also, they'll counter every attack with Osmose. The best way to lower their
HP quickly is to abuse their magic weaknesses. A strong magic Tech matching
their weakness can do close to 2000 damage. Kill them both off at the same
time, or one or two moves after one dies, and you should win the fight.

Bladesman Techs:

Desprate Strike
First Aid (Restores HP)

Location--Tower of the Ancients
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. Master at Arms is very sturdy with those
defenses, so focus primarily on the Bladesman. He has low HP and defenses
so he shouldn't take a ton of effort to kill quickly. Try to avoid hit-all
attacks because Master-at-Arms will counter every attack with Tsubame
Gaeshi, which isn't too powerful but damage dealt can stack up fast.

Use just physical attacks against the Bladesman as they deal a lot more
damage than magic moves. After a few powerful Techs he'll fall and you'll
just be left with Master-at-Arms. Like the Bladesman, use just physical
Techs against him. That high magic defense, and an immunity to Light magic,
makes it hard to deal damage to him otherwise.

His attacks overall aren't terribly hard to handle. He will boost his
attack power occasionally with his stance, or do the opposite and raise
defense. Flash of Steel is his counter in the defensive stance, and it does
a lot more damage than Tsubame Gaeshi. Keep healing and you'll have no
problem slowly whittling down his HP.

241-Once-King Dalton

Gale Slash                Violent Belch
Energy Sphere
Scorch (Fire Tech)
Deep Freeze (Water Freeze)
Plasma (Light Tech)
Nether Blast (Shadow Tech)

Location--Dimensional Vortex (1000 AD)
----------------------------
Don't take this fight against Dalton lightly. He's far, far more dangerous
than his previous two joke encounters. With high magic defense like that,
sticking to physical attacks is your best bet. A team of Ayla/Robo/Crono
prevails here. Robo and Ayla's Double Tech, Beast Toss, can do a good 5000+
damage to him. Yeah, that's only a few attacks needed to kill him off, hm?

Of course, it's not that simple. He busts out MP Buster (no pun intended)
after losing a decent chunk of his health. He counters with it, so you'll
be constantly drained of your MP. Of course, if you work fast in depleting
his HP you likely will skip over the point where he uses it. When he's
getting low on HP he'll start spamming his high powered Techs, although
at relatively high levels they really shouldn't do a lot of damage. I've
never witnessed him use Iron Sphere, but it's clearly his most dangerous
attack if it gets used.

Location--Dimensional Vortex (1000 AD)
----------------------------
You just got finished beating up Dalton. Whatever tactics you used to kill
him quickly simply repeat in this fight. It's not terribly hard. Beast
Toss does 3000+ damage, and Frenzy can do about 1200 damage. If you have
any Shadow Techs, now would be the time to use them. Crono/Ayla/Robo's
Triple Tech can do 3500+ damage. Crazy stuff.

All of his attacks are crazy weak, none of them should be doing more than
100 damage to your party. The exception is Scintillation (it's just
Luminaire), which he uses when he runs low on HP. This move can do 300+
damage to your party, but at the time he uses it he should be so close to
being killed that it should not be an actual threat.

Location--Dimensional Vortex (12,000 BC)
----------------------------
A pretty simple fight. Her crossbow is much stronger than Marle's, unless
of course you obtained the Venus Bow. All you really need to do is smack
her with your strongest Techs. There's no real tricks to this battle. Her
Icefall Tech deals about 150 damage to everyone in the party...although by
this point in the game your entire team likely has maxed HP out at 999.
That's not much of a dent in it, not to mention Marle has a ton of healing
moves at her disposal to cleanse any significant damage dealt.

Barrage is simply her firing her crossbow at you. It's not a damaging
move. Overall, simple fight. Heal whenever necessary and beat the fake
Marle into the ground. Although keep attacking mainly since Recuperate
heals her for about 2500 HP.

Eggsterminator Counters:
Osmose (Absorbs MP)

Location--Dimensional Vortex (2300 AD)
----------------------------
A bit of an annoying fight. The Eggsterminator is the real foe here, but
don't scoff at such low HP considering how high its defenses are. Lucca
should hopefully have Flare, so spam the hell out of that to deal a ton of
damage to the Eggsterminator. The most annoying thing about the fight is
that it will counter every single attack with Osmose. You'll be drained of
your HP really quickly, so keep an eye on it and restore whenever needed.

Crimson Shade's moves should not harm your party terribly much. Shadow Fire
is simple Fire II, and Explosion is Flare. 200 damage to your entire party
at most, but not something that a little healing can't mend. Speaking of
which, Eggsterminator's Recover heals itself and Crimson Shade's for 1000
HP. Hence why you'll want to kill the Eggsterminator quickly, so as to stop
that damn move from constantly occurring.

Crimson Shade herself is quite easy once she's by herself. Bash her with
non-Fire magic and physical moves until she falls.

246-Dream Devourer
HP-32000
Defense-220/Magic Defense-80 (Varies)

Magic:
Varies between different phases

Techs:  Counters:
???     ???

Location--Time's Eclipse
----------------------------
Okay, let's get one thing straight about the superboss. He has two phases,
and he switches between them as he takes damage. The Techs he uses in them
also change, and since they are not listed in the Bestiary their actual
names are taken right from the battle. He also has a secret phase that only
occurs when one member of your team is left standing. Regardless, let's
settle this.

The first phase is relatively simple to understand. His main attack is to
"Devour dreams from another dimension", dealing about 200 damage to the
whole party. He uses it before anybody can get an attack in. Dream Devourer
doesn't have any other forms. It's just a straight up 32000 HP boss. From
here on out you'll want to bash it with every strong move in your aresenal.
Give it all hell.

He will counter every non-magic attack with Mana Reaver, which swipes away
all of your MP. As such, stick strictly to magic attacks. You need to be
doing damage to this guy constantly, and this is realistically your only
way. He'll also use Mana Reaver as a normal attack occasionally, making
chugging down Hi-Ethers a constant priority for your team.

Dreambind inflicts Stop on one member of the party, but at this point you
should be wearing status immunity equipment, making it a moot attack. He
has Curse much like Lavos, so if he chooses to use it then your status
immunity equipment is pointless. His Incinerate attack is a bit more
powerful than Flare, dealing 250+ damage to your entire party. Likewise,
Heavenly Peel is similar to Luminaire, only a bit more powerful.

Life Reaver does an insane amount of damage to one character, but it and
Curse (described earlier) will be thrown into his movepool when he's lost
around 10000 HP. Other moves he has is Starfall, which does a ton of damage
to a single character. Gravity Sphere will do a decent amount of damage to
your entire party.

Once you've drained about half of his health, he'll switch to the second
phase. He starts this by "Lowers Defense and begins storing power." You
can't possibly miss that notice. Now, he absorbs all magic types, so you
will have to stick with physical attacks. Take this time to pound on him
with strong physical moves, but more importantly make sure your entire team
has a ton of HP. He counters all attacks with Chaos Zone, dealing about 100
damage to your entire party.

After a few attacks Dream Devourer will use "The End of All and Nothing",
a souped up version of Destruction Rains from the Heavens. He keeps his
Life Reaver and Starfall moves, now gaining Supernova (with mimics
Luminaire in the aspect that it'll hit your entire party for a lot of
damage), Ice Lance (simply Ice II, probably his weakest attack), and
Pandemonium (deals a low amount of damage to your whole party).

Oh, it also has Phantasm. One of his strongest attacks, it deals a ton of
magical damage to your entire party.

Now, the general strategy at this point is, again, pound on him with
physical attacks. The fight should be over soon as you'll likely being
doing a lot more damage than with just magic attacks. Remember to keep
healing as he'll always be countering with Chaos Zone.

However...if you manage to get knocked down to just one party member, Dream
Devourer will change his attack pattern until you have two or all of your
team members standing. His four attacks consist of the painful Life
Reaver, the powerful Heavenly Peel, the strong Starfall, and the weak
Dreambind. He'll counter with Mana Reaver or Chaos Zone depending on which
phase he is currently in. Plain and simple, revive one of your allies as
soon as possible. Going solo against those moves isn't a smart idea.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          ~12Ec.Special Enemy Notes~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several enemies have special quips about them that make them hard to find
and deeply annoy players with how obscure they are.

Although half the time it's your own fault for not exploring.

014-Cyrus
He's found in the Northern Ruins in 1000 AD when you first visit it. Once
you obtain the carpenter's tools and begin repairing the ruins in 600 AD,
he disappears. It's impossible to win this fight--your party will run away
after a few attacks.

038-Servant (Crossbow)
He's found in the Fiendlord's Keep, in the long room where you get into
fights if you walk between the statues. You can avoid these fights if you
go around these statues...but the last fights have this enemy in them. If
you avoid them you obviously aren't going to be fighting him.

040-Save Point
Also Fiendlord's Keep, when you reach the room where Ozzie drops you into a
lower room if you walk on certain space, there are four save points. Two of
them are actually this enemy, one is a real save, the last is a warp back
to the pitfall room with Ozzie/

049-Fallen + Soul
Annoying because the requirements for this enemy are very obscure. In the
Northern Ruins/Hero's Grave, the last room holds Fallens and Souls. Get 
into a fight against them and kill foes so there's a single Fallen and a
single Soul left. Wait a bit and they will merge to Fallen + Soul (although
when you attack the foe his name will just appear as Fallen, but his 
sprite is a yellow Fallen and it appears in the Bestiary as this foe).

082-Red Eaglet
I'm shocked it's actually possible to miss this considering the amount of
forced fights with Golden Eaglets. Well, when a Golden Eaglet is low on HP
it turns into a Red Eaglet. No, at high levels it's still possible to not
kill it! Either put the Nu Arcana on an attacker and hope it activates,
bringing the Golden Eaglet to 1 HP (thereby making it turn Red), or equip
Marle with her weakest, default bow which does such pitiful damage the 
Eaglet should still change colors.

087-Rafflesia
In the near first room of Reptite Lair there's a hole you can fall in. If
you wait a bit the Weevils in the room create additional holes. Several of
these holes lead to this enemy.

110-Turret
On the Blackbird when you leave the inside and are on its wing, these are
the enemies you probably avoided thinking they'd do something bad. At least
that was my train of thought. C'mon, I can't be the only one who did this.

131-Spekkio
Spekkio has six different forms, changing depending on the highest leveled
character in the party that enters his room. You'll likely never spot his
first form as it only appears when nobody in your party exceeds level 9.
If you defeat a higher form of Spekkio, his previous forms you missed also
get added to the Bestiary. As for his final form, #131, someone in your 
party must be level 99.

135-Wonder Rock
The big one himself. This foe, superior to a Rubble in terms of Exp, TP, 
and G handed out after victory, is found in only three places. It can be
found in the second area of Mt. Emerald in 600 AD, relatively close to the
summit, the middle of Millennia Wood in 600 AD, or in Frozen Cliffs in the
Dimensional Vortex. For the last one, the area it spawns at is down a 
bunch of ladders just to the left of the slide that dumps you onto the 
slippery slope. You know the one. Despite not having a Charmable item in 
the Bestiary, Ayla can charm the Lumicite Shard from it (you also get that
from killing it). The item can be used in the Lost Sanctum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           ~12F.Item Encyclopedia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's like the Bestiary. Only with items!

Similar format, this time listing the item, effects, shops, chests, and
enemies the item can be found. For some items I'll ignore those sections
and use the space to describe the event you may get the item from.

In the Enemies collumn, if the enemy has a (C) next to it, the foe gives
that item when Charmed.

Also, remember that a lot of items are available only for a limited time.
For instance, the five foods in the 65,000,000 BC Lost Sanctum can only
be obtained during the sidequest where you must obtain them. Afterwards you
will need to start a NG+ to have a shot at them again. Also the trades in
the Ioka Hut in the same era only last a limited time through the game. Do
the trades ASAP!

                              ~12G.Ending Log~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple list of the 13 endings and their requirements. The endings
themselves are NOT spoiled in any way. Enjoy them for yourselves. 

Sadly you cannot replay the endings in this menu, only view the 
requirements and a picture of a scene from the ending.

Ending 01-Beyond Time
The standard ending to game, you get this by defeating Lavos after reviving
Crono at Death Peak.
**The ending is altered a little bit depending if you destroyed the Epoch
by warping to 1999 AD instead of using the bucket or fighting in the Black
Omen.

Ending 02-Reunion
A depressing ending, yet one that makes sense, this is obtained by killing
Lavos while Crono is dead.
**Like with Ending 01, this ending also depends if the Epoch is destroyed
or not.

Ending 03-The Dream Project
The oddest (but possibly most hilarious) ending, you must defeat Lavos 
using the right telepod as soon as you start the game, or defeat Lavos in
the forced fight at the Ocean Palace.

Ending 04-The Successor of Guardia
Use the right telepod to defeat Lavos once you return to the present after
your first trip to 600 AD, but before you reach the End of Time for the
first time.

Ending 05-Good Night
The worst ending that makes no sense, use the bucket to defeat Lavos as 
soon as you reach the End of Time, but before returning to 600 AD to 
progress the story.

Ending 06-The Legendary Hero
Defeat Lavos once you return to 600 AD, but before you obtain the Hero's
Badge.

Ending 07-The Unknown Past
Defeat Lavos after obtaining the Hero's Badge but before the Gate Key is
stolen by the Reptites in 65,000,000 BC.

Ending 08-People of the Times
Defeat Lavos after obtaining the Gate Key from the Reptites, but before 
giving the Masamune to Frog.

Ending 09-The Oath
Defeat Lavos after giving the Masamune back to Frog, but before you fight
Magus in the Fiendlord's Keep.

Ending 10-Dino Age
Defeat Lavos after fighting Magus, but before you fight Azala and the Black
Tyranno.

Ending 11-What the Prophet Seeks
Defeat Lavos after killing Azala and the Black Tyranno, but before you
witness Schala opening the sealed door with her pendant.

Ending 12-Memory Lane
The ending with the shortest time span to obtain, you must defeat Lavos
after witnessing Schala open the sealed door with her pendant, but before
getting your own pendant powered by the Mammon Machine.

Ending 13-Dream's Epilogue
Defeat the Dream Devourer in Time's Eclipse.
