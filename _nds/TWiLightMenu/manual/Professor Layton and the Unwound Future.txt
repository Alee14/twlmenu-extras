::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
It's finally here!! The third game to the Professor Layton series, titled: 
"レイトン教授と最後の時間旅行" which roughly translates to "Professor Layton 
and the Last Journey Through Time" Again, I strongly recommended you to 
complete the first two games before starting this one. And I assume you have, 
as I will NOT cover any returning basics of the game.

As of the time of writing, there was no english version of the game available, 
so therefore this guide is written based on the JAPANESE version of the game. 
Surely, when the English version is released, this guide will also be of help 
for those stuck in the game.

And about the English version, it's gonna seriously take a LONG time for these 
games to be translated to English. Some of the puzzles can't even be 
translated, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for an English release. Who 
knows if there will even be one...


This guide was created using a Japanese font, but as long as your computer can 
read Japanese characters, it should be fine. (You may have to change your 
browser's encoding in order to read Japanese characters)

Note: This does NOT translate the story of the game, I will only do a rough 
      translation of the puzzle instructions given, and various small aspects 
      of the game to make the game easier for people who don't understand 
      Japanese.

Note2: I haven't put all the explanations as to HOW I got a particular answer 
       (especially in the mathematical puzzles), if you would like to know how 
       I got a particular answer, email me. My email is written below.

Lastly, if there is something you do not understand, or if I have made an 
error, please contact me at:

Since this game is in Japanese, to make things easier, and incase you get 
stuck, I have included a list of all the areas in the game, and the translation 
used in the guide below.

    Hint : This is about a pirate group that was captured. They were taken just 
           before executing their boss's order, and this was the order:
           "The 10 pieces of gold we took can just fit in the hole in the wall, 
            and we'll keep it there until the storm calms down. However, do not 
            put large pieces on top of the smaller pieces."
           Could they actually execute this order? Try putting all the gold 
           into the wall.

                 Illegible Letter
Picarats : 60
    Hint : The first letter said the following:
           "Recording the conversation between the man and woman at the 
            restaurant. Their voices were similar so some parts aare missing, 
            but I'll somehow add in something later."
           Looking at the second letter, mark all the characters that the man 
           said. And ofcourse, the two of them should be saying something that 
           has meaning.
Solution : This was a hard puzzle...
           Tap the following characters:
            First row: か の じょ
           Second row: にめ にゅー
            Third row: を た
           Fourth row: の む

           That makes a sentence which says: "Give her the menu."

                 The Turnabout Puzzle
Picarats : 80
    Hint : When you looked into the machine, there were several gears turning. 
           A turn in the direction of the red arrow, and so does B. 
           It seems like the 'a' gears manouver and turn the machine. Use the 
           'b' and 'c' gears t replace 'a', to make the B gear turn in the 
           direction of the green arrow.
Solution :   1) Replace 'a' with 'c'
             2) Turn 'b' around 180 degrees, and place it to the upper left of 
                'c', just so that two left gears are connecting the gears.

Puzzle No. 154 : ナゾ154　トランプの山
                 Mountain of Cards
Picarats : 50
    Hint : In a deck of cards excluding the Joker, there are 52 cards. 
           There are 26 red and 26 black cards. When I tried to split the pile 
           in half, I counted that one pile had 23 cards.
           What is the difference in the number of red cards in this pile, 
           compared to the number of black cards in the other pile?
Solution : Assumne:
           First pile had:
            x black cards; so there are
            23-x red cards

           Second pile has:
            a black cards; so
            29-a red cards

           We need 29-a-x (1)
           We know that x+a=26, so a=26-x (2)
           Sub (2) into (1)

           And the answer is 3

07. STRANGE PICTURE BOOK                                                  {BOOK}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This is a fairly Japanese intensive section, you really need to know Japanese 
to finish the picture books.

First of all, I'll explain what to do:
Throughout your adventure, you will get stickers for your picture book. There 
are three stories in the book, and the stickers are stuck in place on each page 
according to what the story tells you. Even though the sticker may pop up in 
several different locations throughout the story, you only need to use it once, 
it appears automatically in the other pages.

It's not too hard, as the stickers already separated between the three stories 
for you, and as long as you can read the story, it's not too bad.

The Menus:
----------
 > On the first page you can select your story, or look at the stickers you 
have from the button at the bottom.

 > Once you have selected the story, there are five buttons in the new screen.
    - bottom left button shows the stickers, and you drag these to the main 
      part of the screen to stick them in to the story
    - bottom middle button removes all the stickers you have put on
    - bottom right button goes back
    - right (or left) button changes pages
    - top right button lets you see the completed story (only once you have 
      stuck all the correct stickers on)

Story 1:
--------
  Page  1 - This is a story about a fine, sunny morning. As I was walking along 
            through the meadows, there was a 'TREE' on my right, a 'RED THING' 
            on the road infront of me, and a 'YELLOW THING' on my left.
            Did someone drop these? I couldn't just leave them there.

  Page  2 - When I arrived to the plaza with a 'TREE' in the centre, there was 
            'SOMEONE' desperately trying to find something under the 'TREE', so 
            I approached the person.
            "I am looking for someone who may have dropped something. Do you 
            know someone who looks like they lost something?"

  Page  3 - That 'PERSON', surprised me and said:
            "That 'YELLOW THING' is mine. Thank you for finding it for me."

  Page  4 - "This is something that just fell from that 'TREE'. I'll give it to 
            you as thanks."
            The 'PERSON' took out a 'RED THING', and gave it to me. It was 
            shining, and looked very tasty.

  Page  5 - I walked further into the meadows. As I was walking, 'SOMEONE' came 
            into my view, so I called out:
            "I am looking for someone who may have dropped something. They may 
            have dropped this 'RED THING'."

  Page  6 - That 'PERSON' replied to me in a small voice:
            "I'm not sure. There is a house further down from here, so try 
            asking there." I said thanks and continued further.

  Page  7 - I wonder if the person who dropped the 'RED THING' lives in this 
            house. I knocked on the door, and a kind looking old lady answered 
            the door.
            "Good morning, how can I help you?" On the dining table was a tasty 
            looking 'YELLOW THING'.

  Page  8 - "I am looking for someone who may have dropped this 'RED THING." 
            "Oh, that 'RED THING' seems to belong to the baby here. Thank you 
            for finding it." The old lady said thank you and gave me the 
            'YELLOW THING'.


Story 2:
--------
  Page  1 - This is a cafe on the outskirts of town. Today, the 'OWNER' went 
            out, so it's up to me to look after the store.
            The 'OWNER' said to me as he left, "Take care of everything while 
            I'm gone, I'll be back as soon as possible."

  Page  2 - After the 'OWNER' left, I saw that he forgot something. There was a 
            'WHITE THING' left on the counter.
            "Oh no! But the 'OWNER' had already left, so he couldn't hear me."

  Page  3 - After a while, the bell on the store rung, The first customers of 
            today were these 'PEOPLE'.
            "It's pouring. I want to drink 'SOMETHING WARM'. Something very 
            hot."
            After saying that, they sat at the table by the window. When I 
            looked outside, it had started to rain.

  Page  4 - After a while, the door opened again. As I heard the sound of 
            raindrops crashing on the stone pavement, the next customers came 
            in.
            "Phew, It's just like the forcast said, the rain is making it quite 
            cold. Please give me 'SOMETHING WARM'.
            Saying that, the 'PERSON' moved to the back of the store. The 
            'PERSON' always sat back there.

  Page  5 - Now then, since the 'OWNER' is gone, I'll try making 'SOMETHING 
            WARM' for the customers by the window.
            Oh yeah, I also have to make 'SOMETHING WARM' for the customer at 
            the back.
            "Oh no! I can't find the 'WHITE THING'."

  Page  6 - At that time, the door bell rung again. "Yes! the 'OWNER' is back." 
            But when I turned around, it was another customer.
            That 'PERSON' also moved to his normal seat at the counter.

  Page  7 - "Phew, I'm tired. But I'm glad I got this 'WHITE THING'. Oh yeah, 
            make me 'SOMETHING WARM'."
            The 'CUSTOMER' placed a 'WHITE THING' on the counter. "Let's share 
            this."

  Page  8 - I said bluntly: "Thank you very much, but sorry, I can't make 
            'SOMETHING WARM', I'm out of the 'WHITE THING'."

  Page  9 - Having heard my voice, the 'PERSON' by the window said:
            "When drinking 'SOMETHING WARM', rather than having it black, I 
            prefer it with a few drops of the 'WHITE THING'."

  Page 10 - The 'PERSON' at the back then said:
            "The English way to drink 'SOMETHING WARM' is definitely with the 
            'WHITE THING'.
            Then the person at the counter also said: "I wanted to drink 
            'SOMETHING WARM' so I came all the way out here, that's too bad."
            Oh no! This I'm in trouble!

  Page 11 - At that time, the door opened again. The 'OWNER' has come back!
            "Wow, so many customers. Welcome!"
            I looked at the 'OWNER'S' pointed hat and felt relieved.

  Page 12 - "I can't find the 'WHITE THING' anywhere!"
            The 'OWNER' then said to me: "What are you saying? If you can't 
            find the 'WHITE THING', I told you to go and buy some!"


Story 3:
--------
  Page  1 - One day, I heard from an old fried that he needed me to help him 
            solve a problem.
            I quickly went over to his place. A 'MAN' in black welcomed me at 
            the door.

  Page  2 - According to my 'FRIEND', an 'ORNAMENT' had disappeared from on top 
            of the fireplace.
            "Not many people come in and out of this mansion, it must be that 
             someone at this mansion has hidden it."
            A 'BOY' whispered from the shoe of the door, he said he's talk more 
            about the case in his study.

  Page  3 - Then the other visitor said: "Ah, Young Master! Actually... ah, are 
            you with a customer? I-I'm sorry."
            And the 'MAN' left the room.
            "That was..."
            "You can who he is from his hat. What did you want with me?"

  Page  4 - "Oh look, there's someone lese here aswell."
            "Meow"... 'SOMETHING' said.
            "Haha... She's the queen of this house. Oh no, time to study. We'll 
            talk again later."
            "You going to study by yourself?"
            "As if! I have a tutor."

  Page  5 - I went to the dining room. A 'MAN' was surprised by my arrival, and 
            dropped one of his 'TOOLS'.
            "Oh, a customer... Please don't surprise me like that."

  Page  6 - "The 'TOOL' you just dropped... is that yours?"
            "N-No, it's the Young Master's. I found it in the garden while I 
            was working and was thinking of returning it."
            "Then why are you in the dining room?"
            "The Young Master loves eating, he's always here."

  Page  7 - When I went out to the garden, there was a 'MAN' there. He looked 
            at the 'TOOL' and said:
            "I'm looking for the owner of this. He's a 'MAN' wearing blue 
            trousers."

  Page  8 - And then a 'WOMAN' came along.
            "Oh, there you are. The young master is calling for you."
            "Okay."
            "It's the young master's study time."
            The 'MAN' rushed: "Oh, it's already that time."

  Page  9 - "Meow"... it was the 'SOMETHING' again.
            "Look, your feet are covered in mud! Did you go out into the garden 
            again?" 
            The 'WOMAN' sighed.
            "The garden?"
            "Yeah, the people of this mansion don't know but, he digs holes and 
            buries important things, like a dog."

  Page 10 - Next to the muddy footprints there was a silver 'TOOL'.
            "This is... oh yeah, the 'MAN' in the study said he was looking for 
            this."

  Page 11 - I talked to my 'FRIEND' about the missing 'ORNAMENT'.
            "Was it a shiny thing?"
            "Oh yes, it was a small goddess statue, but had beautiful 
            handiwork."
            "I see. I think I see the truth behind this case."
            "Really! As expected..."

  Page 12 - My 'FRIEND' gathered everyone to the hallway, and I talked about 
            the truth.
            "After the 'ORNAMENT' was gone, a 'MAN' was looking for something 
            in the garden, thinking it was a prank by the 'BOY'.
            Among the holes in the ground, he found the 'BOY'S' 'TOOL'."

  Page 13 - "The 'MAN' was also suspicious. He saw mud on the floor in the 
            'BOY'S' study and thought something that was wrong. So he went to 
            the garden to look for evidence. If you look carefully, the mud 
            marks were footprints left by 'SOMETHING'.

  Page 14 - "The 'MAN was also suspicious, but not of the missing 'ORNAMENT', 
            but of his missing 'TOOL'. He thought it was a prank by the 'BOY' 
            who is always in the dining room."

  Page 15 - "That's mean, everyone was suspicius of me! I wouldn't hide the 
            'ORNAMENT', and wont use the 'TOOL', and I wouldn't take out 
            something like the 'TOOL'."
            The 'BOY' was angry.

  Page 16 - "Everyone was trying to protect you."
            The 'BOY' looked at everyone.
            "O-Oh, so that's what it was." my 'FRIEND' said kindly.
            "There is no bad person at the mansion."
            "Exactly, the real criminal is over there."

08. TALKING PARROT                                                        {PARR}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The parrot is used for talkting to specific people. When you first get the 
parrot, he doesn't know any words, but as you play on, he'll learn more and 
more words. There are a total of 45 words to learn, you should have them all by 
the end of chapter 11.

One he knows more words, he can start talking to people. There are 12 people in 
the game to talk to. You go into the parrot menu and search for a person to 
talk to, and if it found someone, go back to that area, and the parrot will be 
flying over the person it can talk to. Talk to him/her, and the parrot game 
begins!

What happens is, the person you talk to says something, and you reply with 
the bird using words the parrot has learnt to fill in gaps. The answers at 
below, just put the words in the brackets into the blank boxes.

The second part of the talking parrot is the 'secrets' section, which is 
revealed depending on how friendly the parrot is with Luke. It is detonated by 
the percentage number on the main parrot screen.

The Menus:
----------
 > On the first page
    - the top button is to find people on the screen to talk to (only once your 
      parrot can start talking)
    - bottom left button shows all the words your parrot has learnt
    - bottom middle button goes back
    - bottom right button let's you see the parrot's secrets (once it is 
      friendly enough with Luke)

Puzzle No. W14 : 牛とニワトリ
                 Cows and Chickens
Released : 2009.02.26
    Hint : There was a man who decided to buy some livestock. The seller wanted 
           him to buy both cows and chickens together.
           "It's cheaper if you buy 30 animals."
           "Tell me how many of each you want."
           "Umm... Together there's 100 legs, that's pretty cool, right?"
           Now then, how many cows did he buy? None of the animals were 
           injured in any way.
Solution : Let x=cows, y=chickens:
           4x+2y=100  (1)

             x+y=30
               y=30-x (2)

           Sub (2) into (1)
           4x+2(30-x)=100
             4x+60-2x=100
                   2x=40
                    x=20

           So there are 20 cows, and therefore the answer is 20.

Puzzle No. W20 : 毎年１０人で
                 10 People Every Year
Released : 2009.04.09
    Hint : In a school, in the first three years since it opened, 100 students 
           enrolled. In the 4th and following years, 10 more people enrolled 
           compared to the previous year.
           If there are over 400 students in school, how many years has the 
           school been opened?
           Assume that there are no transfer students or drop-out students.
Solution : 1st year: 100         = 100 students
           2nd year: 100+100     = 200 students
           3rd year: 100+100+100 = 300 students
           4th year: 100+100+110 = 320 students
           5th year: 100+110+120 = 330 students
           6th year: 110+120+130 = 360 students
           7th year: 120+130+140 = 390 students
           8th year: 130+140+150 = 420 students

           Therefore, the answer is the 8th year.
