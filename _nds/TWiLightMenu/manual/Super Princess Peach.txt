Your weapon of choice is  Gloom Vibe. Get close to Boss Piranha Plant without
touching him and when his mouth is open, use the Gloom Vibe's tears to fill him
up with water to make him fall over then stomp on his belly button to cause one
hit of damage. We suggest making the beanstalks grow to give you a slighter
advantage. When he burps, he sends a soundwave to knock you back then creates a
sandwave which you can jump over. Repeat the process again for hit number two.
If you are low on the Vibe Guage, let Boss Piranha Plant's mouth stay open till
he spits out then eat them to replinish the guage. After the 3rd hit, he'll
turn red and start flapping his leaves (wings) and dropping down. When you have
the moment of opportunity, finish him off with two more hits.

The best way to kill most unded enemies (Boos, Dry Bones, etc.) is with Rage
Vibe since it gives off light which is a ghost's enemy. Dry Bones are also
killed by Poundbrellas or bashing objects into them. The first door leads to
the first Toad and to get it, bounce off one Green Koopa to hit the switch then
use the Joy Vibe to float to it. Exit out and go up to the second door, this
leads to a passage full of coins and a pipe leading to a room with false walls.

area then from the door, use Joy Vibe and float to the upper left and enter the
door. The last Toad is there the moment you enter. Work your way to the area at

He takes 20 hits total to defeat. His attacks consists of charging, breath a
big fire beam, chucking hammers, spitting fireballs and a stomp that creates a
shockwave. It takes 4 hits to register a real hit. He charges into a statue to
create a vibe crystal. After 2 (8) hits, he'll stomp at you continuously cause
shockwaves then it's time to get 4 more hits. After the 3rd (12th) hit, he'll
cry and jump high and cause large hammers to fall. Avoid them and get ready for
4 more hits. He'll get mad after the 4th (16th) hit and he will spit fireballs
like crazy. 4 more hits and Round 1 is yours.

He's enormous. He starts off stomoing his fist and making spike balls fall.
Then he sends out a circle of hammers that spread out followed by a different
pattern of fireballs for each hit. Next comes the Bob-oms. Scoop one up and
hold it until it flashes then toss it up and make it explode in Bowser's face.
After the 4th hit, he'll try to heal himself. Use the Joy Vibe tornado to burst
his bubble then finish him off.
