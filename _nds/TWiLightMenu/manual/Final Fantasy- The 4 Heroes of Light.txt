I.    Introduction                                                   [tadapsg]
==============================================================================



Popping the game in sure was a nice, change of pace compared to the standard
iterations of more recent games, at least to me.  It's got a decidedly old
playing style, with mechanics based on discovery rather than guiding players
everywhere throught the game world.  There's quite a lot of a player having to
read between the lines to decipher where to go next, glimmering advice by
speaking to the various NPCs and the like throughout the land.

Therefore, it seems rather ironic that a guide would be written up for such
a game like this.  With new players not used to these types of throwbacks,
realizing what games of ye olden days once were like, the need for guidance
feels "right."  We all shared such tips on the playground when lost.

In regards to mechanics, to those on the fence, there's a job system in place,
realized via the Crown System; it's essentially the player's way of picking
each job for each main player character.  With standard staples, like the
generally useful White Mage, to more esoteric, such as the Seamstress jobs
in place, there's bound to be something that appeals to the player.  The story
lacks, at least at the time of this write-up; your hometown comes under some
magical curse and only some of your party feels the need to save it.  It kicks
off a quest to save the world from the approaching darkness, hinted at by the 
recurring crystals, which grants you with each of the game's Crowns.

Expect a lot of soloing, or near soloing, though, despite the game's subtitle
of there being four Heroes of Light.  The party spends a good part of the
game split up from one another, so just be aware of that.

As you start the game up for the first time, a message will show up saying the
saved data is being reset to default.  After some time, you'll be presented
with the title screen to start the game.  Do so and you'll have a prompt to
name each of the four main party members.  I'll be using the default names in
the guide but will personally be using customized names.  Those default names
are: Brandt, Jusqua, Yunita and Aire.

Brandt's mother, Kuore, wakes Brandt up, telling Brandt he needs to go and see
the king.  Kuore gives Brandt directions on how to get to the castle: head to
the back of town and follow the road to the castle.  Before doing so, examine
the top right corner behind Kuore, to find <POTION> inside hidden chest (1/8).

Exit your house and go in the grass on the left side of your house.  Right
next to your house you'll find <POTION> inside hidden chest (2/8).  Head down,
across the bridge and from the bushes of this first house, go South into the
grass to find another hidden chest (3/8) with <POTION> inside.  Enter the
house on the left side and examine the barrel at the back of the room for yet
another hidden chest (4/8) to claim <DRAGON WING>.  Speak to the soldier near
the gate leading South out of town to get <PHOENIX DOWN> and speak to the man
on the left side of the Item Shop to get a <POTION> as Brandt's birthday gift.

The man on the right side of the item shop is your save point; remember what
he looks like, since you should stay on the lookout for save opportunities.
Save if you wish, then head North and go inside the inn.  At the very top of
the inn, examine next to the bed for <TORCH> inside a hidden chest (5/8).  Go
West to the house at edge of town and inside, at the top of the stairs, near
the bed, is a hidden chest disguised as a box (6/8) with <DRAGON WING> for
the taking.  Head up to the Wireless shop and speak to the man near there to
gain a <POTION>, then go down and around to the storage shop.  Outside, in
the grass near the bottom leg of the bridge looking thing is another hidden
chest (7/8) containing <POTION>.  By now, you might want to put some items
in storage or sell them for money since we'll be picking up at least six (6)
more items before leaving town, with a few more along the way, with luck.

Head up through the center of town to the next screen.  Go East to the giant
windmill and along the right side, on the cliff, you'll find an invisible
hidden chest (8/8) with a <POTION> inside.  Head across the wooden bridge to
the West and follow the path to the castle.


   ~ Horne Castle ~

Enter the room in the top left for a chest with <POTION>, then backtrack to
the room in the top right for two chests for the taking, containing a
<WOOD SHIELD> and <POTION>.

Take the central stairs up to the throne room and speak to King Horne to learn
of your next mission; you have to agree to continue the storyline.  After
agreeing, the King gives Brandt a <STEEL SWORD>; speak to the nearby Minister
now to gain <100 GIL> as well.  Head back to town and speak to Kuore, back
at home, and gain <INHERITED RING>.  Remember to equip everything before
leaving town, and save if you'd like.

    1F, South            B1         1F, North

If you'd like to save your Torch, you can follow the above maps to get you
through North Caves.  The only thing to note is on Floor B1, as you approach
the stairs to Floor 1F North, you'll run into a spiral looking enemy on the
main map; this will signify a forced story encounter, sometimes as a boss, as
it is in this case.  Jusqua will temporarily join your party to beat Minotaur.
After the battle, refuse Jusqua's request to go home to have him join the
party out of the caves.  After that, head out to the exit.

On the overworld, enter that suspicious looking building in the clearing.

Minotaur strategy:
Brandt was at Lvl2 and Jusqua at Lvl5.  There's not much you can do, option-
wise: have Brandt use normal attacks and let Jusqua Boost to gain enough AP
to cast Fire.  Each Fire hit seems to break the Minotaur's horn, causing it
to get in more attacks and do damage, so try to finish the battle quickly.
If both Brandt and Jusqua are feeling psyched, let both of them attack to deal
slightly more damage in a combined attack.  Heals, both through item usage
and Cure spells via Jusqua, will target the person with the lowest HP.

From the entrance at 1F, take the door to the far left; the center door is
locked for the moment.  Pass this soldier while going East to a room where
you have a closeup of the party characters.  Continue East and open a chest
for <CURE TOME> near a soldier.  Remember to set the ability on Brandt before
moving on, since Jusqua already has access to Cure.  Beyond the Cure Tome
screen, take the path closest to the screen to find yourself at the entrance
screen, just on the upper right side with two chests for the taking.  The top
chest yields a <POTION> while the lower chest has a <MIMIC> encounter, which
will give up STEEL ARMOR after winning.  Head back one screen and take the
stairs in the upper right corner to go up to 3F.

Walk towards the screen, then go to the left, then up.  Before taking the
stairs, grab the <PHOENIX DOWN> from the chest and we'll find ourselves on
Floor 2F.

Walk to the right and light the candle.  You'll note that a door is heard
opening.  That door would be the locked door at the very beginning of the area
that I mentioned was locked, so let's make our way back there.  Before doing
so, though, we'll be running into spiral enemies where we found the Cure Tome
for Brandt.  After taking out the enemies there, answer with either response
and Yunita will join the party.

Back at the entrance, enter the now opened center door and, along the back
wall, left center, you'll find a chest with <HORNE's BOW>.  Take the stairs
to the right to reach 2F.  Head to the bottom right corner here to find a
<DRAGON WING> inside a chest, then take the stairs to the left to reach 3F.
Continue walking up and take the save offer and enter the door.  Approach
Aire, save her and try to leave the room; we get a boss battle.

Greaps strategy:
Brandt at Lvl5, Jusqua at Lvl6, Yunita at Lvl8 and Aire at Lvl5.  If you have
any Wind Foils equipped, remove them; Greaps resists Wind and is vulnerable to
Fire.  Everyone should have access to Cure and two users should have Fire;
I'd suggest making Aire one of those Fire users due to her already equipped
King's Shortsword.  Basically, always Boost to have at least 2AP saved up for
every party member, since you never know when you might need to do a group
Cure session.  While on the ground, Greaps gets one, sometimes two attacks,
but while in the air, Greaps gets two attacks the majority of the time.  While
in the air, Greaps uses an attack that hits all party members for about 10 HP
worth of damage; couple this with a chance of using this twice in a row means
keeping everyone's HP at least above 20 HP.  Keep sending out Fire spells for
your main method of damage, while chipping away with regular attacks when Cure
isn't necessary, and Greaps will fall.

After the battle, you'll see a talking crystal, the opening credits and access
to the WAYFARER CROWN.  Step into the magic circle and make your way back to
Horne, either by walking or using one of the Dragon Wings we picked up along
the way here.

Head to the castle throne room and speak to the character you'll find there.
Jusqua and Aire will leave the party, so take any items from their inventories
that you'd like Brandt and Yunita to have access to.  After they leave, exit
town and head East into the desert.

Continue walking East through the desert until you run into an event and come
across another character.  Meet Krinjh, the last of the Moon Folk.  You're
directed to Moonlight Tower in the Northwestern area of the desert.  You can
find the tower along the coast; if you walk too far North and come across a
cave called Fairy Path, you went too far, so follow the coast South.  Enter
Moonlight Tower.

treasure chest to the left for <TEMPEST PIKE> and head back down to Floor 1F.
Take the top right stairs at 2F-B to grab a <PHOENIX DOWN> nearby and head
back down to Floor 1F, this time taking the top left stairs at 2F-D, then
the stairs at 3F-E to reach Floor 3F.

At the intersection, go left and take the stairs at 4F-F, then 3F-G and go all
the way to the right to pick up <RISING SUN> in the chest at the end of the
hall.  Backtrack to the intersection near 2F-E and this time go right, up to
4F-H.  Hit the save if you want and head up to Floor 5F.  At the very top left
corner, grab a chest with <1000 GIL> inside, then approach and examine the
sparkly pedal in the center to gain <MERKMAL>.  You can now find Guera, our
next destination.  Exit the Moonlight Tower.

First things first, there's new hidden chests in the area.  Head to the right
side of town to find a well; just to the right of the well, in the bushes,
is a <POTION> inside one such hidden chest (1/8).  Enter the Wireless Shop
North from here and check the table on the left side for <EYE DROPS> inside
another hidden chest (2/8).  Go left and inside the inn, heading all the way
to the right end, checking between the top bed and the table for <POTION> in a
hidden chest (3/8).  Circle around to the big house on the other side of the
wall from the Wireless shop to find <ANTIDOTE> in the left cupboard's hidden
chest (4/8).  Now go around this big house and hug the wall behind to find a
clearing; examine the left tree for <ANTIDOTE> in another chest (5/8).  On the
Northern left side of town you'll find a magic shop.  Go inside and examine
the left set of shelves, specifically the center one, to find a chest with
<POTION> inside (6/8).  The other two hidden chests aren't accessible at this
time, in case you're worried about that.

During the day, go straight back to Guera Palace, taking two teleporters up to
see the king.  Agree so that he'll help Horne, then go outside of town and
wait for night to fall.  Go back inside Guera Palace and, after taking the
first teleport, head down either wing twice and take the door in the opposite
corner, which would normally be blocked during the day.  Go down the set of
stairs and go inside the lowest cavern inside to enter Guera Caverns.

No new enemies here, and you can save another Torch if you feel up to it,
since the lighting is just good enough to follow the above maps.  From the
entrance, grab the <TORCH> and go left to A.  Swing down the left side and
down the B stairs to B2 and grab the <WOOD AXE> and go back to B1.  Continue
down the path and at the intersection veer right to grab the <ETHER> and go
left until you hit C, going down to B2.

Follow this path and take the Northern path up to claim what we need: the
<WATER TOME>.  From there, head left at the intersection and keep going up
to reach D, leading to B1.  Go all the way up, grab the <PHOENIX DOWN> in the
chest, then head left and jump off; this is a one-way path to where the Torch
chest was at the beginning of the area.  Exit out of the caverns.

Before heading out of town, take the villagers on their suggestion and equip
one Rock Shield.  Then head out and, from Guera, walk in a general Northeast
direction and you should come upon a castle looking thing.  Go inside.

        ENTRANCE                            [5]: <EARTH AXE>

From the entrance, take the path to the left and grab the <PHOENIX DOWN> from
the chest at the end of the path.  Backtrack to the right and head up twice,
left once and you should come upon a four way intersection.  Go left to find
an <ETHER> at the end of the hall, then head back to the intersection and
go up to the stairs.

In the following rooms, if you fall into the quicksand, you'll fall to the
floor below.  For some of these, we want to fall down to reach a treasure
chest that would normally be inaccessible.  Starting at the top of 2F, go left
and down, ignoring the first set of stairs and taking the stairs off to the
right.  Take the stairs below you, back to 2F, and we'll find a switch in the
corner.  It needs water magic to activate, but thankfully, we already picked
up the Water Tome back in Guera.  Activate it, then head back up to 3F, then
2F and take the stairs we initially skipped.

Go down and take the center quicksand trap, marked with the ? in the map
above.  You'll fall right next to a <BLUE SHOT> chest on the left.  Claim it
and take one of the quicksand traps back down to 1F and head back to 3F.
Once you return, take the stairs above you to 4F and fall in the quicksand
trap diagonally down and to your right; you'll fall in the middle of a bunch
of quicksand traps, with a chest holding <BANEKNIFE> before you.  Grab it,
fall back down to 2F and make your way back to 4F.

Take the stairs to your right and fall in the bottom most quicksand trap on
the right side.  Ignore the stairs and claim the <EARTH AXE>, then take the
stairs we just passed by, taking either of the top two traps to return to 4F.
Climb back up, take the stairs directly below you twice over and make use of
the save point to your left.  Taking the stairs marked as L will lead to
the boss room.

Sand Devil strategy:
Steal everything useful from Krinjh, since he'll be leaving after this battle.
Whoever is equipped with the Rock Shield, give the other main party member
Krinjh's Robe for the defensive boost.  Similarly, designate one party member
as your mage, hopefully taking the Aero Tome as well, and be certain that
their Water spell ability is active; give the other party member Krinjh's
Sword.  If you can't tell, Krinjh may as well perish in this fight.  For the
battle itself, have your mage cast Water to start and your attacker attack.
For as long as Krinjh stays alive, let him chip away at the Sand Devil's
health with regular punches.  Every two to four turns, you'll get a message
saying that "sand begins to flow," signifying the need to recast Water.
After about half of Sand Devil's HP is lost, it'll start to use a sandstorm
attack to hit everyone on your side of the field everytime the sand begins to
flow again; with our defensive setups, taking Krinjh's equipment, these
sandstorms should be doing a max of 15 dmg, with regular attacks doing near
5 dmg.  Focus most of your attacks with your attacker, continue healing with
Cure use and keeping your AP totals healthy and this fight will be over.

After the battle, Krinjh directs you to the land of Arbor, saying the key to
saving Horne is there, then leaves the party with Ariadne.  You gain access to
two new crowns: the WHITE MAGE CROWN and the BLACK MAGE CROWN.  Take the magic
circle out of Quicksand Castle and head Southeast, back to Guera.

Stay at the inn.  We can't go to Guera Palace since a guard is blocking the
entrance, and also directs Brandt and Yunita to stay at the inn, so we might
as well do that.  Brandt gains a World Map and a new party member in that Cat.

! MUSICIAN CROWN is available by purchasing the Music Score from the Wireless

battles if not playing in multiplayer.  Do know that you'll be able to pick
it up eventually, even if you're playing strictly solo.

Gain control of Aire.  We also have yet another set of hidden chests to find.
First, head out of the house and take the path just to the left and follow the
path to a house.  Go down to the basement and take <GIANT's RING> from the
chest.  Head back outside and examine the space to the right of the house for
<HI-POTION> in the hidden chest (1/8).  Circle North around where you started
to go up a set of stairs, past the item shop, and take the stairs to the
right up to the teepee looking building.  Head inside, go upstairs again and
examine the bushes on the right for a hidden chest <POTION> (2/8).  Leave
and go South to find the inn, then examine the flowers in the space to the
right of the house directly East of the inn for some <EYE DROPS> in a hidden
chest (3/8).  Enter the inn, go to the room at the far left and examine the
upper bed for <ECHO HERBS> in another hidden chest (4/8).  Go through the
gate to the South to reach Liberte Port.

Head to the right, climb aboard the ship and examine behind the mast to gain
<DRAGON WING> from the hidden chest (5/8).  Continue heading South to find
another save point and an item shop to the East; go behind the item shop to
find <GAIA DRUM> near the cliff behind the shop (6/8).  Go inside the Storage
shop and check the bottom right corner, below the vase, to find <POTION> in
a hidden chest (7/8).  Head past the second inn and check the clearing
Southwest of the second inn; in the middle of that area, you'll find
<PHOENIX DOWN> in the last hidden chest (8/8).

Head back to the house with the Giant's Ring in the basement and speak with
Apollo, the kid looking out the window.  Now speak to his mom, near the front
entrance.  Head back and speak with Jusqua to tell him about the pirates to
get him to rejoin the party.

Before heading out, set Aire as a White Mage and Jusqua as a Black Mage, then
equip them with the White Robe and Black Robe, respectively, leaving you with
50 Gil if you haven't been selling anything yet.  Remember to set their
abilities, as well.  Exit town, go East, following the coastline to a cave.

The password is Freedom.  Take the stairs down and go left to reach the B2
left room areas.  Continue going down and left to grab a chest with <300 GIL>.
Head back to take the right set of stairs to reach the B2 right room areas.

Keep going down and right until you meet up with the save point character.
Beat the left guard for a <ROCK LANCE> chest and the right guard for a chest
with <TERRA STAVE>.  They're both guarded by slightly stronger Lizardman
enemies, sporting 60-2HP and giving up 8 Exp each.  When you feel you're
ready, take the stairs North of the save character and we'll get our boss
encounter to save the captives.

Trollud strategy:
Jusqua and Aire were both at Lvl11 with Jusqua, a Black Mage for now, holding
that shiny new Terra Stave.  Start Aire with a Healthgiver and let Jusqua
stick to casting Fire spells; for the whole battle, Jusqua keeps using Fire.
If Jusqua is hit once after being fully healed, Aire has leeway to get
another Healthgiver up for the following turn; else, Aire should use Cure.
You want to keep Healthgiver up as often as possible due to Whirling Bludgeon,
an attack that hits both party members for near 20 dmg, slightly more if
Trollud has Berserk up.  Keep an eye on HP levels and you'll be fine.  For
those rare instances Aire has a Healthgiver set and doesn't need to use Cure,
sneak in an attack or Boost.

After the battle, take the stairs beyond and grab all the treasure.  Clockwise
starting from the stairs, you'll find <500 GIL>, <ICEBRAND>, <500 GIL>,
<OCEAN STAVE>, <HUNTING HORN> and <ANTARCTIC WIND>.  After claiming your
spoils, speak to each captive, then examine the vase to meet Lilibelle.  Pablo
then suggests stopping by to visit him back at Liberte.  Exit the hideout and
head back to Liberte to take Pablo up on his offer.


   ~ Liberte ~

Enter Liberte during the day and speak to Apollo to gain <APOLLO'S TALISMAN>.
Speak to Pablo if you wish, but head back to the house you're resting at,
just to the right of the path of Apollo/Pablo's house.  Lilibelle suggests
checking the whirlpool, so head outside of town, wait for night to fall, then
come back in.  The whirlpool is at the top of Liberte's Port screen.  Enter.

From the entrance, head past the first opening, then keep to your right to
tug on the lever to Lz1.  This opens the door marked z on the above map.
Continue upwards, snaking around the path and open the chest for a <MIMIC>
encounter.  This one is slightly stronger than the first Mimic at the Witch's
Mansion, between 43-55 HP and gives up 28 Exp.  After claiming the STREAM CAPE
that the Mimic was guarding, head to the right, to the stairs to B2.  Equip
it to reduce the primarily water damage attacks in the dungeon.  I'd suggest
giving it to Aire, though.

In this mini-section, you'll need to hit both y levers to open the door at y.
Just stick to the path, hitting the first lever at the second corner at Ly1,
then the second lever at the end of the path, at Ly2.  Backtrack to the now
opened pathway and head down for another set of levers to trip.

Take the path to the right first for convenience.  Go up to hit the Lx1 lever,
then head down and wind around to hit the Lx2 lever.  Backtrack to the right
and grab the chest up above for <EARTH BOW>, then take the stairs to B1 to
find another <MIMIC> encounter (50-83HP, 31 Exp) to gain BOLT SWORD as your
reward for winning.  Go back to the locked x door and go to the left this
time.  Go all the way to the bottom to grab the chest with <ECHO HERBS>, then
take the branching path we passed on the left.  Go up to hit the Lx3 lever,
then down to hit the final Lx4 lever.  Head back to the now opened x door and
go all the way down.  Hit up the save, since we're going to have a boss fight
after taking the stairs and approaching the treasure chest.

Brainshark strategy:
Aire alternates between Healthgiver and Cure, while Jusqua sticks to casting
Fire spells.  If you don't really need healing, Aire can attack Brainshark
directly.  Fairly often, Brainshark will use Waterspray; the damage isn't a
problem, but the possible Sleep and Poison status conditions may give cause
for concern.  Keep up healthy doses of healing and Fire magic attacks and
this will be over in a few turns.

After the battle, Jusqua will leave and Aire is forced to open the treasure.
Do so and we'll wind up back at Liberte.  During the day.  As a cat.

Go to your room and speak to Apollo, the kid.  Then speak to Lilibelle, the
fairy on your bed.  Gain <FAIRY MAP> and we're headed out to the overworld.

Walk North, then West, around the beach/cove.  Continue to the most South-
westernly corner you can reach, enclosed by some mountains.  Just North from
this spot, there's a line of trees against the mountains.  Enter there.

Head up through the center of town; we're going to pick up the other hidden
chests that we couldn't get with Brandt and Yunita.  At the weapon shop, go
through the hole on the right side, then continue to the right to find an
<ANIMATE TONIC> in a hidden chest (7/8).  Head over to the top left corner of
town and enter the hole near the Northern magic shop; along the water's edge,
behind the locked door building, you can find <DIRT DIRK> in Guera's final
hidden chest (8/8).

If it's not night, head outside and wait for night to fall, then come back
inside to Guera.  If the spells above pique your interest, you can find the
magic shop through the hole on the left side of the item shop, again, only
during the night.  When you're ready, speak to Brandt outside of the inn to
get him to join the party.  With Brandt in tow, head out to the overworld.
We're going to the Northwest corner of the desert, inside Fairy Path.

I'd suggest heading straight for the exit at this point in time.  Those
Hellhound type enemies are particularly tough without fire protection, which
we can pick up shortly after reaching Urbeth.  When you do want to explore,
there's your maps, above.  You can, once again, save a torch by bumping into
the walls and feeling your way through.

Once reaching the overworld, head North, then bank Northwest.  You'll be
coming along Urbeth soon.  Just be aware of any Hellhound encounters; they're
often mixed with a beefed up Lizardman companion.  Just don't go East, since
the world does wrap around itself on foot.

The town is split up into quadrants; the Northwest quadrant is for weapons,
the Southwest quadrant is for items and storage, the Southeast quadrant holds
the armor, magic and inn areas, and the Northeast quadrant is primarily the
residential areas, with the accessory shop in the vicinity.

Our goal is to show up during the day time and go to the odd Sorcerer's house
in the Northeast corner of town.  Agree to both questions and we're left with
needing to raise 10000 Gil.  The four shopkeepers of Urbeth each have a job
available for you at this time.  Note that after paying the Sorcerer and going
to the inn, all but Thauzand's request will be lost.  It's in your best
interest to do AT LEAST two of the following subquests, specifically for the
next section; no, repeating Thauzand's subquest twice doesn't count.

Trylion, of the Accessory shop in the Northeast quadrant:
   Sell three rings; Reward: 2500 GIL
      1) Man on the dock at the Northeast quadrant
      2) Woman inside the left house, along the dock, at Northeast quadrant
      3) Man near the inn/upgrade shop at the Southeast quadrant

Mylion, of the Armor shop in the Southeast quadrant:
   Give a Bomb Fragment; Reward: 2500 GIL
      These are random drops from the Hellhounds outside of town

Bylion, of the Item shop #3, at the Southwest quadrant:
   Defeat the Chimera at Hunting Caves (B1) near the exit; Reward: 2500 GIL
      42-70 HP, gain 8 Exp, drops Sapphire gem

Thauzand, of the Weapon shop at the Northwest quadrant:
   Run a shop; Reward: whatever you can profit; repeatable
      This is the easiest method, but you may need to do Trylion's quest to
      gain enough capital to start selling items.  Head over to Item shop #3
      and buy a max of six Ethers, putting them all in storage.  Head up to
      the Weapon shop and open a counter, ignoring the current trends of the
      moment.  Put up all your Ethers for sale, focusing on the bigger "pair"
      slots if applicable; mark those as 5000 Gil and add the "hot item" tag
      to it, ignoring any empty slots.  Then wait for people to buy them,
      pocketing the profit.  Repeat as needed to pay the Sorcerer's 10000 Gil
      fee, to lift the hex on the cat following Jusqua.

   ! SEAMSTRESS CROWN is available by doing well in Thauzand's sidequest.
   To do so, you need to raise the maximum amount of money, only doable with
   10 single slot items; you need to sell all 5000 Gilx3 items, 1000 Gilx3
   items and 500 Gilx4 items.  It's easiest to do if you take a loss, such as
   selling those Firaga/Waterga Tomes for 1000 or 500 Gil, pretty much
   guaranteeing those sales; do note that that's an extreme example.  You'll
   have to hope the shoppers buy the remaining books at market value if you do
   this example, though.  It's available anytime Jusqua is in town, so feel
   free to skip it until you have better items to sell.

When you have the money, head back to the Northeastern corner and pay the
Sorcerer, then do as suggested and head to the inn, noting it costs 50 Gil
per night, in case you just had enough to cover the hex removal fee.  Now
would be a good time to start our customary hidden treasure chest hunt.

Starting from the Sorcerer shop and going clockwise around town, go inside the
Accessory shop and examine the right shelf, left-hand side, for <HI-POTION>
in the hidden chest (1/8).  Head South, near the dock, and enter the right
house, checking the center of the cabinet in the back room for <POTION> (2/8).
Head to the dock, examining the suspicious crate against the wall for an
<ALARM CLOCK> (3/8).  Head to the Southeast quadrant, go inside the inn and
head upstairs on the lefthand side; check the bathtub for <HYDRAXE> (4/8).
Cross the bridge to the West and, on this side, head down to the riverbank.
Step into the water and go all the way up and left, behind the tower as far as
you can go to find <ZEUS'S WRATH> (5/8).  Get out of the water and go to the
Southwest quadrant's Item shop #3.  Upstairs, to the right of the doll looking
thing, you'll find <GREAT TREE LOG> (6/8).  Head outside and go North a bit to
find a diner or restaurant; check the barrels at the left counter to find a
<CROSS> (7/8).  Our final hidden chest is to the West of the diner place.
Examine the set of barrels on the upper row, finding yourself not able to get
to the barrels themselves, and we'll find a <HI-POTION> (8/8).  Head back to
the inn and rest to progress the storyline.

There's four spiral enemies to deal with, each going against the Merchants
running the town.  First, go to the Northwestern quadrant and speak to Yunita,
hanging out near the statue.  We need to get her equipped, so head to the
Armor shop in the Southeastern quadrant first.  A Hellhound and Cowpel are
guarding the entrance.  Equip Yunita with current equipment, making sure to
buy at least one Darksteel Shield; two would be ideal.  She's not staying
long, so if the shield is all you can get her, that's fine.  Next stop, check
the Accessory shop in the Northeast quadrant for any additions you'd like
for both Jusqua and Yunita; it's guarded by a Chimera and Succubus.  Ignore
the Weapons on your way to Item Shop #3, since those double spirals signify
a much stronger opponent.  Item Shop #3 is guarded by a single Rock Golem,
and stock up on any items you may need.  Now head over to the Weapon shop
and gear up for the boss.

Demon strategy:
As mentioned, equip those Darksteel Shields to minimize damage.  Demon has two
forms: an open eye and a closed eye, beginning the battle with a closed eye.
In this form, Demon does basic attacks and throws out a Dakra spell, which
does 60-90 dmg without the shield equipped.  Continue attacking with any light
based weapons you may have to increase damage and keep your heals up.  Soon,
Demon will switch to an open eye form, which will allow use of Blade Blitz
and slightly more chances of getting hit by a Dakra spell.  The former hits
all party members and will continue switching back and forth between the two
forms.  Demon throws out a Cure spell on itself after getting down to about
10% of its life remaining, healing for about 20% or so.  Keep up the attacks
and heals and we'll move on.

Gain MERCHANT CROWN and SALVE-MAKER CROWN with the victory.  Go inside the
Weapon shop and speak to Thauzand, then head to the inn and spend the night.
Jusqua will set off alone, so head outside of town, take the ship and swing
North to find the Sorcerer.

Another town, another set of hidden treasure chests.  There's a <HI-POTION> in
the bushes just North from the raccoon at the entrance (1/8).  Head inside the
tree and go right, checking the long stem mushroom for <EYE DROPS> (2/8).  Go
up the stairs and check the apples near the item shop for <ECHO HERBS> (3/8).
There's an <ALARM CLOCK> in the pot above/on top of the item shop (4/8).  Take
the path up to find the wireless shop, then go to the room to the left.  Check
the dishes for <BOMB FRAGMENT> (5/8) and the top of the long stem mushroom
for <POTION> (6/8).  Examine the apples behind the wireless shop, along the
back wall for another <POTION> (7/8).  Continue going up to the Queen's room,
examining the stairs to the right, leading to the Summit, for the last hidden
chest with <PHOENIX DOWN> (8/8).

Our goal is way back near the inn, where the Eye Drops were.  You might want
to bring along fire type weapons for this next area.  When ready, head down
into the Great Tree Roots.

Head right and speak to the mouse at the point marked with a "?" in the above
maps; Torte will join the party.  Our goal is to pick up the Animal Staff,
which Torte says has the power to heal Brandt.

At the first intersection, head left to grab <GREAT TREE HARP>, then head back
and to the right for the stairs.  Again, head left to grab a chest with
<PHOENIX DOWN>, then head back and go right.  At the next intersection, take a
left, then take a right at the next intersection.  Go all the way up to claim
the <ANIMAL STAFF>.  Exit out of the Great Tree Roots.


   ~ Arbor ~

Go outside of the tree trunk and use the Animal Staff on Brandt.  Go inside
the tree trunk, climb up to the top and speak to the Queen.  Agree to help
them find Arbaroc.  Picking up a Red Shot for Brandt is highly recommended
before setting out.

From the Queen's throne, take the left exit out and climb up to Great Tree.

Head to the right and keep going right at the first intersection.  At the four
way crossing, go up to grab a <PHOENIX DOWN>, then go left to the stairs at A
to grab a <WIND CAPE> at 2F.  Backtrack to the first intersection, taking the
path down this time, and continue across to the stairs at B, leading to 2F.

Go left and up, through the doorway, to enter an inside area, between floors
2F and 3F.  Go left then down to D to come out near a <PHOENIX DOWN> chest.
Go right and around to the stairs at E, to go back down to 2F.  From here, go
all the way down, then left, to the stairs at F to reach Floor 3F.

Go right, detouring down to grab a <HI-POTION>, then back up to the stairs to
Floor 4F.  Take the <PHOENIX DOWN>, take the stairs back to 3F and head to the
right.  Take the first path up for stairs leading to a <MIMIC> encounter; the
prize for winning is a WOOD LANCE.  Go back to Floor 3F, swing around to the
upper right entrance into another inside path, straddling Floor 3F and 4F.
Grab the chest to the right for an <ETHER>, then go left and down to reach 4F.

Head as far down as you can to grab the <HI-POTION> in the chest, then at the
first intersection, go as far left as you can, taking the stairs to 3F for a
chest holding <FAIRY CAPE>.  Go back to 4F, go right, up then left and hit up
the save point before the boss battle through the hole.

Arbaroc strategy:
Make use of the Wind Cape and Fairy Cape, with the Wind Cape going to your
healer and the Fairy Cape going to either of the remaining two.  Keep a
Healthgiver active, particularly when Arbaroc is in the air, since that's when
it'll use Thundagaa and Airstorm to deal damage to the whole party.  While on
the ground, Arborac gets its usual two attacks with a regular attack and at
times a Leafra spell.  If Torte is attacking rather than healing, stick him
using Blizzard since he's not initially setup to do any physical attacks.
Brandt should be doing upwards of 30 dmg with Red Shot equipped.  Just keep
your HP values in check, accounting for the worst case scenario of two
Thundagaa spells in a single turn, thus having your HP above ~40 most of the
time; hence heavy dosages of Healthgiver-> Cure.  Levels ranged between 17-19,
with Arbaroc's steal being a Phoenix Down.

After the battle, you'll gain ELEMENTALIST CROWN and RANGER CROWN.  Also, rob
Torte of everything he has; if you don't have inventory space, that's fine.
You can take the magic circle back to the beginning of the area, head back to
Arbor's Storage shop and clear up some space, then rob Torte blind.  Once
that's done, talk to the queen.  Torte leaves the party and the Animal Staff
upgrades into the TRANSFORM STAFF.

When you regain control, go back to talk with the queen, then head up the
stairs to the right for the summit.


   ~ Path to Summit ~

No need for a map here, nor an enemy listing.  Wind your way to the top of the
screen until you change screens.  Use the Transform Staff to turn back into
animals, then try to jump across.

So, Aire made it and Brandt fell, right?  Bring Brandt South, near Arbor, then
go West, across the isthmus.  I'd highly recommend switching Brandt to the
Wayfarer class, as well, solely to be able to run from tougher encounters.
If you don't have any offensive spells on Brandt, you'll need to do some
running away, specifically from any Silky enemies.

Once across the isthmus, start your trek to the North, where all the snow is.
Enter the cave.

Go to the right, grab the lower candle and put it in the candle holder on the
bottom path to open the way to <HI-POTION>.  Backtrack to the upper path,
grabbing the candle along the way and put that in the candle holder to open
the way to B1 West.  For those having trouble healing, Boost/Cure on Yoton
or Lizardman enemies, while running away from Silky; the former attacks you
can easily take a few hits from, especially the Lizardman.

Head down and grab the candle to the left, then go all the way down to melt
the first ice block.  Grab any of the three remaining candles on the right
side of the room and use it on the second ice block; repeat for the third
ice block, denoted by the ) symbol, going up.  Grab the last candle to melt
the ice blocking the <INTELLECT RING>, then swing to the left to go through
the door.

Walk down the center until you see a suspicious hole.  Transform into a dog
and wiggle your way inside, marked as the ? on the above map.

Now we're in control of Jusqua, on a boat.  Go to the Northwest, surprisingly
by the snowy area where we just left Brandt.  There's a beach nearby to moor
the ship, and a cave to explore.  Enter the cave and make use of the save.

                            EXIT         T       [3]: <DARKENING HARP>

Head to the left, grab the upper candle and place it in the upper path for an
<ETHER>, then grab the lower candle and use that to progress further in.

Head left, then up and grab any of the three candles.  Go all the way to the
right, beyond where you came in and open that pathway.  Head back to grab
another candle from the upper left corner and bring it with you through the
newly opened path, then up, to open that ice block.  Head down from here, grab
the nearby candle, then go through the new path and use this candle to gain a
<FLAME SPEAR> in the chest beyond.  Go all the way down to the next room.

Head to the far right, grab the candle and go down and right.  Melt the ice
block and move on to the next area.

Here, take the door one space to the left and grab the <DARKENING HARP> in the
waiting chest.  Count two doors to the right and go inside, make use of the
save point and go on through for the boss encounter.

Sorcerer strategy:
Not much thought here.  You can steal a Potion if you want.  The best he can
do is poison and confuse you.  Just attack a few times to end the battle.

Behugemoth strategy:
Here's the real boss.  In the first part of the fight, you can steal a Potion.
Just survive three rounds and part one will auto-end, and Brandt will join.
In part two, you can steal a Hi-Potion.  Keep your HP up and attack as if it's
a regular enemy encounter.  After you drop its HP by half, roughly 250 points
of damage, Behugemoth's horn will break and will start casting Thundaga every
turn.  Now it's essential to keep your HP up, and depending on your setups,
you may need to use items for AP-friendly healing.  If you have Mirror
opened up, on the Black Mage set of skills, this fight will be a lot easier,
as well as bringing along an Elementalist.  You can do either before the
Sorcerer fight if this part of the battle gets too difficult.

After the fight, Brandt officially joins up with Jusqua and you get your
10000 Gil back from the Sorcerer.  Continue beyond and we'll get to the exit.

Once outside, go East and enter the town you see.  That's Invidia.

! BEASTMASTER CROWN is available by doing well in the math game, where the
polar bear is hanging out.  I'm not sure how many points you need, but I got
it unlocked with 257 points.  Tips on scoring high: use multiplication
whenever possible and don't be afraid to skip, since the penalty only seems to
be around 3 points or so; also, skip anything where all numbers look fairly
low, even if it's solvable, since whatever shows up at the equal sign is
added to your point total.

More hidden chest goodness.  Enter the door to your left to be inside the
Weapon and Storage shops.  Examine the bags near the barrel directly across
from the Weapon Shop for <POTION> (1/8).  To the right of the Storage shop,
examine the pot in the fireplace for <HI-POTION> (2/8).  Go right one screen
to the Wireless shop and inn, checking behind the furnace closest to the
screen between the two shops for <TRANQUILIZER> (3/8).  Go to the next screen
on the right, grabbing the <ANIMATE TONIC> on the bookshelf near the locked
door (4/8).  Go right again to the polar bear math game thing, checking the
bed at the top left for <ANTIDOTE> (5/8).  Go right again to the Armor and
Item shop, taking <BOMB FRAGMENT> from the table closest to the screen (6/8).
Go right to head outside, checking a tree near the man to the left of the
giant egg; you'll find <POTION> (7/8).  Head up the center stairs to find
yourself back in the Chief's room, with the locked door, and head upstairs
using the left set of stairs.  Ignore the person for now, going up the landing
and checking the teapot there to gain <DARK SIGH> in the last chest (8/8).

Talk to the person we just ignored to have Rekoteh join the party.  Go down,
then outside and examine the giant egg.  You have two options: 
   -Find a Mythritoise to gain a Mythril, which you'll trade to the Weapon
    shop owner for a Mythril Hammer.  To get Mythril, you pretty much need to
    steal the item as a bandit from the Mythritoise turtles, only available
    at night.  After giving Mythril to to the Weapon Shop owner, stay at the
    inn and return to claim your Mythril Hammer.
   -Get a Firaga Tome way back at Urbeth.

After doing either scenario, you'll fail and Rekoteh mentions needing the
Dragon Harp.  Talk to the Chief, gain MAGIC KEY, unlock nearby door and enter.

From the entrance, keep going right, then head down for an <INFERNO STAVE>.
Go left this time, then up to reach the stairs down to B2.

In B2, go right, then down and then to the left.  There's a <BOOK OF SHIVA>
for the taking, then head down the stairs to B3.

There aren't any enemies in this room, so feel free to take your time.  The
left and right dragons gives hints for the puzzle, both along the wings.  Or
you can ignore the hints and press the switches the number of times listed
in the map above, to open the path to where the boss lies.  Hit up the save
before stepping through the next set of stairs.

Ice Dragon strategy:
Levels ranged between 18-20.  Ice Dragon resists dark based attacks and can
absorb or reflect all water based attacks; too bad that's what they sell in
town, no?  Steals are predominately Potions, but there's a rare steal for a
Stream Cape, the first time I've seen a different potential boss steal.
Equip everyone with either Darksteel or Ice Shields to minimize damage from
Ice Dragon's attacks.  While on equipment, remove Rekoteh's Shark Lance and
give her that Inferno Stave, if you have nothing else, just so she's not dead
weight in this fight.  Once you're setup, keep your heals up and hammer away,
literally if you have the Mythril Hammer, and we'll come out with the win.

For your victory, gain the FIGHTER CROWN as well as the SCHOLAR CROWN, and our
main reasons for coming down here, the DRAGON HARP.  Head outside to Invidia.


   ~ Invidia ~

Go outside of the Chief's home and examine the giant egg.  Ride the newly
hatched dragon to Spelvia.  Be sure to strip Rekoteh of all her belongings
since she's not coming back after this point.

We're back in control of Yunita.  Head outside and talk to Thauzand at the
Weapon shop at the Northwest quadrant.  Say no, you're not looking for Jusqua
to gain STEEL SWORD+5.  Head to the Accessory shop and speak to Trylion to
gain TRYLION RING.  Check out Bylion at the Item shop for a free POTION.
Head out of town and go near the Hunting Caves, getting into battles as a
Bandit until you find Mythritoise in the forest; steal a Mythril and trade it
to Mylion at the Armor shop for RAINBOW BOOTS.  Now we're ready.

For those wondering, that second Item shop is that locked shop below Storage.

First we'll hit up the back entrance.  Head back outside to Urbeth and go down
into the water, where we picked up the hidden chest with Zeus's Wrath.  Go in
the back of the tower and take the opening on the right to grab the <RED SHOT>
here, then go back outside to the main entrance.  Swing up to the left and
take the stairs to 2F.

Take the perimeter all the way around, going beyond the stairs to grab a
chest with <CURA TOME>, then head back to the stairs to 3F.  Go across to
claim a <DARK CAPE>, then take the center path down and head left and take
those stairs to 4F.  Walk to the right, gain the <STAR EARRING> then take the
stairs back to 3F.  This time walk to the right to go back to a different part
of 4F, going all the way to the left, then up to the stairs leading to 5F.

Head all the way to the right, then take the chest above you for <RAISE TOME>.
Take the center path down, then right, and we'll reach 6F.  Go up, take the
center doorway to find a chest with <ETHER>, then continue back down to the
left to 7F.  There's two doors with treasure behind them here, containing
<HI-POTION> in the left door and <SOIL CAPE> in the right.  Go down and take
the stairs to your left to 8F.  Another room with treasure, holding <500 GIL>,
in the center, then circle around to the stairs to 9F.  Hit the save along
the path and continue beyond.

And this is why we traded for those Rainbow Boots back at Urbeth.  You don't
have to equip them to walk on the rainbow, either; just have it in Yunita's
inventory.  Walk up the rainbow to Spelvia.

Well, it's not quite Spelvia yet; we're in the dungeons.  Go to the upper
right corner, making use of the HP healing in the pot near the stairs.  Head
up the center path and take note of that suspicious cat.  Yay, it's Aire!
We're no longer flying solo.  Go just beyond there and we can save.

From the save, go up and take the first left, then head up and take the first
right.  Keep going to the right and head up to grab a chest for <PHOENIX DOWN>
inside.  Backtrack to take the passageway up, to the left of the chest, and
take the stairs up to the next floor.

Go all the way to the right and take the stairs back to B3 for a new area.
Head down then left, taking the path up for treasure holding <SHINING AXE>.
Take the stairs back to B2, this time taking the center path up to the stairs
heading to B1.  Walk down and take the left path to a set of stairs holding
a treasure chest with <MIMIC>; winning nets you a SHINE CAPE.  Go back up to
B1 and head to the far right, taking the stairs here to find another <MIMIC>
hiding in the chest, this time giving up BOOK OF RAMUH upon victory.  Go back
to B1 and take the lower path to the exit.

Let's start on the hidden treasure chest hunt.  Right from the start, after
exiting from the dungeons, examine to your left for a <REMEDY> (1/8).  Go
South and head behind the tombstone, facing the main town of Spelvia and
examine that spot for <SHINING HARP> (2/8).  Get off the tombstone platform
on the right side and check the area there, behind the pool of water, to get
<HOLY BREATH> (3/8).  Head inside the main town.

Notice all the Golems?  If you want to interact with them, to you know, buy
items, access the storage area or use the inn, you'll need to do so as an
animal.  With that out of the way, let's continue our hidden chest hunt.  Go
behind the item shop, entering near the save, to find <INDRA'S SPEAR> (4/8).
Go through the door on the right to find the inn and examine the candles at
the bottom left corner for <ANIMATE TONIC> (5/8).  Continue through the upper
door and check the broken pillar nearest the screen for <DARK SIGH> (6/8).
Continue through the center door, head through the hallway, then find the
wing leading off to the left; at the end of the path is a <DRAGON WING> (7/8).
Now try and find the right wing, a little further in from the left wing, and
grab the chest behind the pillar for <COURAGE RING>.  Continue up to the door
and check the plant on the left side for the last hidden chest, holding some
<ECHO HERBS> (8/8).

Head back to the throne room and speak to Rolan.  Then, head outside and enter
that pool of water near the tombstone and the Holy Breath hidden chest.

        ENTRANCE

Speak to Rolan near the stairs to get him to join the party.  Go behind the
stairs and open the chest for <HERO ARMOR>.  Climb up and enter each of the
above doors, ignoring the center, lower door, since it's blocked off at the
moment.

In each of these rooms, the room goes off in all sides forever.  The goal is
to "speak" to each of the silhouettes as they move around the room, at which
time, enemy encounters seem to be turned off.  The order they move can be seen
above, visually, or if you're familiar with numpad notation, then as follows:

   B: 12339614799              C: 62776127848                D: 83871861967

Once you clear each of the rooms above, enter the once blocked off lower,
center door, and go inside.  Talk to that Rolan and we get a boss fight.

Geri and Freki strategy:
Equip Fire and Ice Shields, giving your main healer a Flame Shield and Stream
Cape combination.  Also while setting up, take Rolan's Thundara Tome, since he
won't be staying around after the fight, thus don't give him anything you
don't mind losing.  Steals are Hi-Potions from both of bosses.  If you haven't
noted how the auto-targetting system works just yet, spells start with the
enemies on the right and physical attacks start from the left.  Thus, stick
with fire-element spells to quell Geri, and lower its breath attacks, while
continuing to hammer away at Freki.  If one of them falls, you have three to
four turns before the boss who dies auto-resurrects itself at half of its
original HP.  You'll need to beat them both to end the battle.

After winning the battle, the world falls into darkness and you get to reunite
with your other party members, Brandt and Jusqua.  Head to the inn to rest up,
remembering to change forms into an animal to be allowed to rest and use the
various shops if you need to re-equip the party.  Use the save, too.

Head to the throne room and we'll get another boss fight.

BOSS                |    HP    | Exp |        Gem        |      Steals
--------------------|----------|-----|-------------------|--------------------
Rolan               |  785-819 | 756 | Diamndx2, Amytsx2 | X-Potion, Lghtbrngr

Rolan strategy:
Equip everyone with Darksteel Shields and either take a Black Mage with Mirror
or an Elementalist with Mysterio; the Mirror option leads to enemy heals of
20-30 HP for every time Rolan uses a dark spell, while the Elementalist route
leads to around 10 damage across the board for each party member, so pick your
poison.  Either addition helps lower overall damage, leaving you with dealing
with the thunder spells, healable with either a White Mage using Healthgiver
or a Salve-maker using Dispensary and Healthcare with Remedy use.  That leaves
your other two party members with whatever attack type you're most comfortable
using.  If you want one of the steals, then you'll need a Bandit; it seems to
be predominately X-Potion steals, with that Lightbringer as one of the rarer
steals.  Keep up heals and damage dealing and Rolan will fall.

After the battle, gain access to PARTY HOST CROWN and HERO CROWN.  Go outside
and talk to Witch of the Sky, the character near the pool that led to the
inside of Rolan's Soul.  Talk to the dragon and we're going on a world tour.
And searching for those legendary weapons of Rolan.

The following include all the shop upgrades after darkness has spread across
the land.  Use the upgraded shops to gear up with the best equipment you can,
or to suit your needs depending on which legendary weapon you're going to go
for to begin with.  Also added are any locked doors in the various towns,
assuming they have treasure to take.

When ready, head to the next couple sections, since they can be handled in
any order you wish.  You'll need to go through all of the following sections
eventually, however.  I'll be listing them in the order of crown acquisition,
though it may not be the best order to tackle the next events in.


   ~ Town of Horne ~

Head to the windmill one screen up from the entrance and unlock the door.  Go
inside and take the <X-POTION> and then the <HI-ETHER> upstairs.  Head over
to Castle Horne to the West, enter the center door on the first level and go
inside the locked cell to claim the <SOUL OF THAMASA>.  We're done here.

Head upstairs to the boss room; the map layout is exactly the same as the
first time we were here, with Krinjh.  Check the previous section further up
for a map on how to get around if you need a refresher.

Once at the boss floor, speak to either character for a battle.

King Guera strategy:
Spell Focus to Blizzara with a Black Mage.  The other three don't really
matter as much.  Since we can't switch Crowns between this and the next fight,
take along a White Mage or Salve-maker and an Elementalist, leaving the last
slot open for another damage dealer or utility character.  If you have Lux,
don't waste the AP to cast it here.  You either win in three turns or the
battle automatically ends with no penalty, other than the missed Exp.

Asmodeus strategy:
You'll run the whole gamut of status effects in this battle.  Both normal and
magic attacks seem to add poison, silence, confuse, blind, sleep or curse
afflictions, so a Healthcare Remedy use might be more in order, in terms of
AP efficiency.  About every 12% of Asmodeus' HP lost results in a snake break,
and if you do more than 12% of damage at a time, as in a Spell Focus'd water
spell, like Blizzaga, then subsequent hits will break them off automatically.
When all snakes are broken off, Asmodeus will have about 800HP left.  Keep
up the Mysterio effects, heal your main healer's status and keep your status
cleared up.  Asmodeus likes to use Firaga, Break and Moonlight Curse, the
latter of which drops all of your buffs and psyches you down.

Gain SPELL FENCER CROWN after the battle.  Speak to Krinjh to gain a legendary
item in the SHIELD OF LIGHT and a fancy new icon above Guera.


   ~ Arbor / Great Tree Roots / Arbor ~                               [17cfaq]

We're going after the Lux Tome and gaining the Monk Crown in this section.

Enter Arbor and speak to the man in the cape, outside, near the entrance and
close to the raccoon.  Head down to the Great Tree Roots.  If you need a map
for the Great Tree Roots area, refer to the first time we've been here, since
nothing changed between then and now, save a new treasure chest.

Head down the path and speak to the mystery character, agreeing to help one
another.  Follow him down the right side to take the stairs down.

Go down the right side again, then take two lefts.  At the end of the path,
we'll find a treasure chest with-- oh, the mystery character wants to open it.
Let him, then watch as he steals the Lux Tome.  Exit out of here and go see
the Queen.  She'll tell you to go to the volcano, off to the North.  Talk to
Torte to have him rush off, Lux Tome in tow.  You'll need to fly there using
your dragon; it's a cave completely surrounded by the mountains.

Before doing so, equip everyone with Flame Shields and water-element weapons
and/or Spring Gauntlets.

Go all the way right, then all the way up to find <FLAMEBLADE>.  Take the
perimeter all the way to the top left corner for a <FIRE AXE>.  Backtrack to
the first path to the right, then go up to find the stairs to 2F.

Head to the right and take the upper path.  Go as far right as you can, then
head down to flip the switch to change the lava flow.  Go down from here and
take the path back up, then go back up again.  Head to the right, then grab
the chest at the first non-blocked off lava path for <BURNING HARP>.  Go down
and all the way to the right for another switch to change the lava flow.  Flip
this one, then go up, taking the left path up.  When you hit the wall, go to
the right, taking the first path up for a <FLAME CAPE>.  The next switch is to
the right, which would divert the flow of lava to block off the latest chest.
Continue to the left to take the stairs up to 3F.

Take the second path down, then approach the lower right switch from the left.
Flip that, then go up and around to the left to hit the far left switch.  One
last switch to hit in the upper part of the room, then take the stairs up to
B5 on the bottom most set of stairs, below the first switch you hit in this
room.

Here, fight the <DEATH TRAP> to your right to claim an ELF CAPE, then snake
your way left, then right, then back to the left to find a save point.  Go up
to find the boss.

Belphegor strategy:
Since we already have Flame Shields equipped, place that Flame Cape on your
main healer, whether it be a White Mage or Salve-maker.  Also pretty much
needed is an Elementalist with Mysterio, since we don't want to be Mirror-ing
fire spells back at Belphegor, since any spell hit causes it to change its
affinity.  Take any other two classes with you for damage dealing, shying
away from the Black Mage, though, since we don't want to be casting spells.
Take out each Cube one by one, then focus on Belphegor.  Don't get too lax on
your healing, however, since Belphegor's regular attacks can inflict sleep,
which might cause some trouble if you can't heal that off of your primary
HP restorer, if Mysterio happens to not be in effect.  When you start seeing
Belphegor using Cure spells, it'll signify it's near the 40% HP remaining
point, so just keep pressing your attacks and remain defensive with Mysterio
use.  Just to reiterate, don't use attack spells.

After the battle, gain MONK CROWN and take the magic teleporter out.  Fly
back to Arbor.

Go talk to the Queen and Torte hands you the LUX TOME.  That's one of the

Go to the Northern town screen, enter the house to the left of the house that
Aire and Jusqua started in and speak to Pione.  Go to the Animal Burrow West
of town.

Exact same layout, exact same password to enter as previously.  Only main
changes are the enemy encounters and the spoils.

Head straight to the boss room by taking the right set of stairs, heading
diagonally down in the next area, diagonally down again, then straight up,
beyond the save point.  Speak to Pione to begin the boss battle.

Seadevil strategy:
Well, it doesn't really feel like a boss battle.  Basically, treat it like all
the other random encounters in the cave, except this one has a ton more HP.
No steals to worry about since it's not carrying anything.

After the fight, speak to Drake, then head to the stairs to take some booty.
Clockwise from the stairs, you'll find <FRESH MEAT>, <DANCER CLOTHES>,
<1000 GIL>, <MONK ROBE>, <DEATH TOME>, <1000 GIL> and a <RUSTY COMPASS> in the
center.  Exit and go back to Liberte.


   ~ Liberte / Overworld ~

Go up to the main portion of town in the North, enter the King's house, that
teepee looking building near the lighthouse, and place the Rusty Compass in
the pedastal in the middle of the room.  Gain CESTUS.

While moving around on Cestus, you won't have to worry about random battles,
unlike on the ship.  Head East, just beyond the Pirate Hideout, then turn
North, into the bay.  Approach that suspicious spot in the middle to get
the enemy's attention for the boss fight.

Leviathan           | 8831-994 | 756 | Diamnd, Amthystx3 | Phoenix Down

Leviathan strategy:
If you have Lux, use it.  Otherwise, equip Ice Shields on everyone, equip any
Stream Capes if you have any and equip fire-element weapons and spells, or
make them into fire-element weapons with the Flame Gauntlet.  Bring the usual
healer, coupled with a Mysterio wielding Elementalist and go wild with your
attacks.  After losing 20% of its HP, you'll notice a break message, then at
about 50% of Leviathan's HP, it'll come out of the water and fly for the
remainder of the fight.  Two things: Leviathan's regular attacks have a chance
of inflicting Sudden Death, which will instantly switch one of your characters
into death status, even if Leviathan's attack actually healed their HP.  The
other thing is to drop whatever setup you were planning when you notice that
Leviathan is charging up; have everyone attack to cause the Charge to falter.
Keep it up and we'll be done with this section.

After the battle, gain DANCER CROWN and officially gaining this legendary
weapon.


   ~ Spelvia / Spelvia Dungeons ~                                     [19cfaq]

We're grabbing the Sword of Light and the Paladin Crown in this section.

Head to Spelvia and go down into Spelvia Dungeons, the cave to the left of
the main entrance into Spelvia.  Equip Holy Shields on everyone and add
Stream and/or Dark Capes to your more active healers on the accessory slot;
the accessory is more for getting through random encounters.

Go inside each of the upper rooms and defeat the spiral Arch Demon inside.
For the upper, left room, from the teleport, the Arch Demon is found to the
South-southeast.  In the upper, center room, from the teleport, the Arch Demon
is to the South-southwest.  Inside the upper, right room, Arch Demon can be
found to the North-northeast.

After beating all three, come back to the main room and speak to Rolan.  The
dark aura should disappear and he'll go through the lower, center door.
Follow him in and speak to the characters there to trigger the boss battle.

Arch Demon strategy:
With the previously equipped Dark Capes, damage should be negligible.
World of Dark causes Curse and Silence status, while Bladeblitz hits your
entire party for, again, negligible damage.  The basic attack, attack, attack,
heal, heal, heal should be more than enough here.  Add an Elementalist's
Mysterio if there are any problems.

Lucifer strategy:
Lucifer's normal attacks are light-element, while the Thunder/aga and Aeroga
spells are light and wind element, respectively; hence the need for the two
capes mentioned at the beginning of the section.  Buff up resistances using
Mysterio, but do it often while Lucifer is in the air.  Reason being is that
Lucifer loves to spam Judgment Bolt, which hits the entire party and drains
everyone of 5 AP.  Keep your HP totals healthy and go ahead and use up most
of your AP, rather than saving it up for future turns, since AP might just get
wiped out with a single attack.  Focus more on offense, pretty much.

After the battle, gain PALADIN CROWN.  Head back to Spelvia's throne room and
speak to Rolan to gain SWORD OF LIGHT, completing this quest for a legendary
piece of equipment and gaining a shiny sword icon over Spelvia.


   ~ Urbeth / Hunting Caves ~                                         [20cfaq]

We're after the Cape of Light and the Alchemist Crown here.

Go to the Northwest quadrant, enter the Weapon shop and speak to Thauzand.
Afterwards, head to the Northeastern quadrant, speaking to the Apothecary in
the same spot where the Sorcerer once was.  Leave town and go to the South,
to the Hunting Caves.

Apothecary to get into an easy battle against one Orc Lord; check the bushes
behind him to gain HI-ELIXIR.  Time to head back to Urbeth.


   ~ Urbeth ~

Go to the Weapon shop and give Thauzand the Hi-Elixir, then head to the inn

Beelzebub           | 2797-821 | 768 | Diamond, Amythyx3 | Steal: X-Potion

Bring along a set of Flame Shields, only equipping them when we're at the
boss encounter.  Climb to the very top of Tower of the sky, making use of the
save point along the way.  At the top, speak to the Apothecary to trigger the
boss fight.

Beelzebub strategy:
Start with Mysterio and, if you have a Black Mage, make use of Spell Focus to
Magic Might or the Leaf series of spells.  Additionally, switch everyone to
neutral element weapons, since Beelzebub is resistant to everything.  With
the previously equipped Flame Shields coupled with Mysterio, the fire attacks
shouldn't be doing too much damage, if any at all.  It's when Beelzebub takes
to the air that's problematic; when that happens, you have two to three turns
to fully heal your party, since Beelzebub will attack with Fall of Angels,
a party wide attack that deals in excess of 100 dmg to all.  If your party
can survive that, you're good to go; use the next few turns to re-heal up, in
anticipation of another flight.  Once you're sure you can take that hit,
the battle should be a breeze.

After the fight, gain ALCHEMIST CROWN.  Take the warp out, then head to the
Weapon shop and talk to Thauzand at the top of the stairs to claim for the
team the CAPE OF LIGHT, as well as a shiny icon above Urbeth.


   ~ Invidia / Invidia Underground ~                                  [21cfaq]

Our goal is to gain the Armor of Light and earn the Shaman Crown here.

Once at Invidia, speak to Rekoteh, near the entrance to the Chief's place,
outside where the dragon egg used to be.  After taking with her, speak to the
Chief inside the building.  Now, unlock the door to the left and enter the
Invidia Underground.  Before going further, equip everyone with Ice Shields
and Confuse Capes, or some combination affording both water and confuse
resistances.

   BOSS
Ice Dragon          | 1186-286 | 471 | Amthysx2, Aqumrnx2| Steal: Potion

Continue on until you hit the puzzle room, with the dragons again.  Again,
there don't seem to be enemy encounters in here.  The left dragon gives up a
hint about moving one dragon once, one dragon twice and one last dragon
three times.  Or, if you don't want to figure it out:
   1.  Press the upper left switch once
   2.  Press the lower left switch twice
   3.  Press the lower right switch three time
Do this in any order.  This will open up the path to the boss.

Ice Dragon strategy:
Use Mysterio with our already equipped Ice Shields and laugh the damage off.
Attack with fire-element weapons or spells.  Nothing new here from the last
time we fought the Ice Dragon for the Dragon Harp.

After the battle, gain DRAGON'S MARK and exit out to Invidia and give it to
Rekoteh.  Head inside the Chief's house and speak to the Chief.  Then, follow
Rekoteh up to her room and talk to her again.  Exit town, summon the dragon
and fly just South to a cave.  Enter the Sun Temple.

         ENTRANCE

Approach the gate and the Dragon's Mark should respond.  Examine the gate and
use the Dragon's Mark on the carving to open the pathway.  Follow the linear
path for two screens.

When we finally get to an intersection, go to the right twice, battling the
<DEATH TRAP> for a GROWTH EGG.  Head back to the intersection and continue
to the left; take the first path up, then take the first path to the left.
At the end of the path, grab the <FOSSIL CAPE> in the chest, then go all the
way to the right to claim a <DEATH CAPE>.  Head back, take the path up, use
the save and get ready for a boss battle.

Mammon strategy:
Keep up an Elementalist's Mysterio with our equipped Ice Shields and you'll be
taking either zero damage or healed.  You'll most likely be doing low damage
as well, without bringing in fire-element weapons and magic spells, coupled
with Mammon's constant Protect and Shell use.  Since you're doing damage and
Mammon can't heal, while you're taking zero damage, this will just be a battle
of atrition.  If this isn't one of your first attempts at a legendary weapon,
then your higher levels will allow you to do more damage to end this battle
quicker.  Alternatively, if you bring along an Alchemist, as suggested by an
NPC at Invidia, you can throw Bomb Fragments for damage.  When all of Mammon's
pieces break off, it'll land and will attempt to confuse your party.  That's
when our Confuse Capes come in handy, which should already be equipped.  Keep
plugging away and the post battle prizes will be ours.

Gain the SHAMAN CROWN with Mammon's defeat.  Exit out of the Sun Temple via
the teleport and fly back to Invidia.  Speak to the Chief twice to gain the
ARMOR OF LIGHT and a nifty armor icon above Invidia on the map.

In order to proceed, you are required to have the Sword of Light, the Armor of
Light, the Shield of Light, the Cape of Light, the Lux Tome and access to the
whale, Cestus, in addition to having beat Leviathan.  If you're missing any of
these components, go back to the previous section(s) to pick them up.  Levels
were in the mid-30s starting this part of the game.

We are NOT progressing through this dungeon yet.  Our only goal is to find the
King, nothing more.  You are free to explore the area, but when you come upon
a certain "sheep puzzle," it's not going to be active at this time; we have to
continue the storyline by talking to the King, hence the lack of a map.

From the entrance, take the first set of stairs you see, then take the first
hallway leading up; if you see the save point character, you're on the right
track.  Enter the doorway just beyond the save, approach the King and talk,
then leave.  Exit Magic Laboratory and Horne, and go to the Witch's Mansion.

Go back to where we first rescued Aire.  There's a good chance that you'll
need to relight the candle off in the left room to open the main entrance's
center door again.

After getting back to where we rescued Aire, beyond the save point, we'll
have to battle Greaps again.

Greaps strategy:
An Elementalist's Mysterio will keep the air spell damage in line.  If you
want to end this quickly, then use Spell Focus -> Magic Might; otherwise,
your normal attacks should be doing high enough damage to end this just a
little slower than the Black Mage's method.

Rolan appears after the fight and gives you a MASTER KEY.  We're tasked with
finding the Lamp of Truth.  Go down to the first floor and use our new key
on the locked door near the stairs.

You can examine the paintings for hints for our next puzzle, or you can use
the above map to solve it directly.  Go beyond the locked door, take the
stairs in the upper right corner and we'll be in the middle of a giant puzzle.
We need to light the candles so that each room has a red flame lit, but with
each flame, one of the doors locks.  Each capital letter represents a candle
to be lit, with the corresponding lower case letter showing which door gets
locked.  Light the candles in reverse alphabetical order to open the door
to the center room.  Approach the chest and we'll be attacked.

Doppleganger        | 300-800  | 104 | Amethyst          | Cross

Doppleganger strategy:
Spell Focus -> Magic Might should knock out two of the four Dopplegangers.
They can't use Raise spells, but they can use Cure/Cura spells.  Stick to the
offensive so they don't have time to regroup.

Gain <LAMP OF TRUTH>.  Exit the Witch's Mansion and return to Horne.

              FLOOR B3                  FLOOR B4                FLOOR B5

From the entrance, take the stairs down to B1 and take note of the gate with
sheep emblazoned on it.  This indicates that the earlier unactivated sheep
puzzle is now active.  Keep going to the left to take the stairs down to B2.

This room is sometimes weird.  A few times, after taking the stairs marked B,
I'd wind up at B', which leads you back to the entrance.  If your screen
looks like it's going straight down, you're good to go, no need to worry.
If it happens to be going to the right, leave Horne completely and come back.
It's fairly isolated, but just in case it happens to you too, that's the only
way I got Magic Laboratory fixed.  In any case, we should be on B3 now.

Go down either side, then swing up the middle to take the stairs down for a
chest holding <STAR EARRING>.  Go back to B3 and head straight down and take
those stairs to be on the outside portion of B4.  Go up on either side and
we'll be at B5.

Take the first set of stairs on the left side to go to B4, then B3, then B2,
to find yourself in a U shaped room.  A chest is on the right side, holding
a <DARKNESS STAFF>.  Go back to B5 and go directly to the right, taking that
set of stairs back to B2 again in another U shaped room, with a chest on the
left holding <EVIL LANCE>.  Make your way back to B5.

Exploring this room a little more reveals a sheep surrounded by some pillars.
Take the lower right set of stairs, marked M in the above maps, and follow
this set of stairs to B3.  Detour to the lower path to grab a <BLACK BOOK>,
then go to the right path to continue back up to B2, then B1.

This is the sheep puzzle.  You want to examine, in order, the sheep facing
forward, right, left, then backwards, marked Sh1, Sh2, Sh3 and Sh4 on the
maps above.  A message should pop up after checking the last, backwards sheep.
With that, take the left set of stairs, marked U.

Continue to B3, opening the chest just below you for a <DARKAGA TOME>.  Keep
going to the right until you make it back to B5.  We're going back to the
entrance now, so take the stairs at the very top of the screen to B4, then
go all the way down for the next set of stairs to B3 and go either to the
left or right to reach the stairs to B2.  From here, it's a straight shot up
to B1; take the now opened hallway, hit up the save and just beyond the room,
we'll have another boss battle.

Talk to the King and use the Lamp of Truth.

Satan strategy:
Bring an Elementalist with Mysterio and Amplify active, and a Black Mage with
Spell Focus and Banishra.  I rounded out the other members with a Bandit for
stealing and a Merchant for the Diamond(s).  Whoever isn't equipped with the
Cape of Light should be holding Darksteel Shields.  Start with Mysterio,
Spell Focus and Lux on the first turn, keeping Spell Focus active while
Amplify is used on turn three.  On the next turn, cast Banishra, since this
is when Satan changes from Sword God stance to Demon Lord stance.  Follow up
with Spell Focus then Banishra again, which should have done more than half
of its HP in damage.  In essence, every three turns, Satan will change its
immunity starting with magic, to physical attacks, then back again.  If your
other three members are sporting light magic, they can back up your Black Mage
during the physical immunity round; otherwise they can heal or boost for AP.
Keep Mysterio up, and Lux should be healing all your damage with Recovery.
Demon Lord stance grants physical immunity and Sword God stance grants magical
immunity, which is what the battle starts with.

Gain DARK FENCER CROWN after winning.  Exit via the magic circle, then go
upstairs to the Castle Horne throne room.  Enter the second door on the right,
talk to the King and gain DESOLATOR.  A new area opens up on the overworld
and all but the Cestus icons disappear from the world map.


   ~ Liberte Town / Overworld ~                                       [24cfaq]

Liberte Town is marked by wherever you left Cestus, the whale.  Go inside
Liberte, head up to the Rusty Compass and examine it, so we can travel around
on Cestus.  Odds are you left it near Liberte Port, so head South and land
Cestus at the beach closest to Urbeth.

If you haven't done any armor upgrading at Urbeth, now would be a prudent time
to do so.  In fact, if you haven't upgraded anything as of yet, buy some of
the Wireless shop armors, the ones that look like armor, rather than clothes
or robes.  Unlike crowns, you can enter and back out of each upgrade attempt
if you don't like the gem distrubutions, given your current stock.  Try and
upgrade everyone to +9 in their armor.

This area of Liberte and Urbeth will essentially serve as our base of ops.
When ready, take Cestus straight South to enter the bubble.

                          MAMMON

As we enter, we're stripped of all of our crowns, at least strictly when in
this environment.  If you leave, they'll be available, but until we re-unlock
them, we'll have no crowns to use here.  It's the number of sub-bosses that
determine what crowns get reunlocked; a specific sub-boss does not carry a
set of crowns to regain.

Pack a few Torches to get through the area, or just stumble along using the
included maps above.  Take along Rock Shields; Asmodeus will fall first.
Press forward to the first set of stairs, then go up and take the upper
entrance for <PHOENIX DOWN>.  Go down twice to stairs to go down to B2.

Run off to the left to go the outside screen; go down to an intersection,
stay to the left, then go up for a <RIBBON>.  Go all the way to the right,
turning with the corner and take the doorway to your right; <KIKU-ICHIMONJI>'s
all yours for the taking.  We can grab the <ETHER> just below where the sword
rested, then make our way back to the center area, entering the inside area.
From here, take the stairs back to B1 and go to the right.  That's where we'll
improve our crown collection, by taking down Asmodeus.  Take the warp for the
rematch.

Asmodeus strategy:
Equip our new found treasures, along with those Rock Shields.  Your healer
gets the Shield and Cape of Light combination, while your attacker, whether
it be physical or magical, gets the ribbon.  Have everyone carry some type of
life restoring skill, like Hi-Potions, Cure/Cura spells and A/Raise.  No
Mysterio access just yet, but those Sidewinders should be kept in check with
our equipment, and keeps your healer and attacker free to do as they please.
Realizing half your team is now immune to status, Asmodeus' primary way of
exacting damage isn't a threat, and doesn't do a whole lot of damage that your
entire team can't deal with on healing duty.  Add Lux to the mix and congrats
on getting our first set of crowns back.  Levels were between 44 and 45 here.

The next easiest boss, I thought, is Beelzebub.  Exit out of Star Chamber and
pick up some Flame Shields and equip those regained crowns, making use of
Black and White Mage for attacking and healing purposes.  If you have space,
bring along Ice Shields for the next boss, Mammon; otherwise, keep them in
storage, depending on your inventory setup, since Mammon needs Confuse Capes
as well.  Beelzebub is on B3, along the far right wall.  Stairway D, in the
upper right corner, is the closest path to get to Beelzebub.

Beelzebub strategy:
Start with Lux, as should be the norm as soon as you picked it up.  Keep your
Black Mage setup with Spell Focus, sitting on enough AP to cast Desolator;
when not boosting, just ping away with attacks.  Have everyone else continue
attacking and your White Mage keeping everyone's HP totals healthy.  When
Beelzebub takes to the air, let your Black Mage cast that Spell Focus'd
Desolator, instantly making Beelzebub drop to the ground and dealing about
900+ dmg to itself while keeping your team same from harm.  Two to three more
of those and we'll unlock the next set of crowns, through Salve-maker.
Levels ranged between 45 and 46 here.

If you brought along those Ice Shields and Confuse Capes, let's take on the
fight with Mammon; otherwise, exit out and bring them out of storage.  From
Beelzebub's, go left and down to where the F stairs are.  If you exited out,
get to B3 via the stairs marked F.  From there, drive to the left after the
turn and take the doorway down.

Mammon strategy:
Cast Lux and, with Ice Shields and Confuse Capes, you've automatically won.
Feel free to set the DS on autobattle and walk away.  Mammon can't heal and
can't deal enough damage to overcome the Recovery effect from Lux while the
rest of the team pings Mammon away to death.  And with that, we got our
Elementalist crown back, among others.  The whole party was at Lvl 46.

Now, it doesn't really matter who we go after next.  I went with Satan solely
because he was the closest.  While coming out of Mammon's area, take the
<HI-ETHER> from the chest to the right.  Head back near the D stairs and go
to the upper wall, still on B3.  We're grabbing the <HERO'S WILL> to the left
and the <FORTUNE EGG> to the right.  Make your way back to the D stairs and
walk toward the C stairs, taking the path up leading to Satan.  Go into the
wall on the left and we'll get the next boss rebattle.

Satan strategy:
Use Lux and Mysterio.  Deal damage however you've been dishing it out.  If you
need extra element support, equip Darksteel Shields and light-element weapons
and spells.  As before, Satan begins the battle immune to magic attacks and
switches its immunity to physical attacks after three turns, and vice versa.
Enjoy the reclaimed crowns.  Levels were bumped up to 47 across the board.

Head back to B2 via the C stairs to bring us near Leviathan; that boss can
be found along the upper wall.

Leviathan strategy:
We should still have those Ice Shields from Mammon's revisited battle.  Equip
those if you removed them and start the battle with Lux and Mysterio.  As in
the Beelzebub battle, keep a Spell Focus active, ready to cast Desolator when
Leviathan starts sending out the message that it's charging up.  If Leviathan
happens to pull off a Tidal Wave, make sure you have Mysterio active, to keep
the damage in the double digits.  Definitely has less HP in our first battle,
since Leviathan starts the battle flying, so this should be over quickly.

Let's grab the last treasure chest we passed.  Go to the right, from where
Leviathan's door was, and go down two, four-way intersections; go to the left
at the third four-way intersection.  Hit the far left wall, then go up to find
the doorway leading to <FRESH MEAT>.  This is near where the ribbon item was,
so head back to the center, inner area, and take the stairs back to B1.  We're
taking out the last of the revisited boss battles now.  Go to the left path.

Belphegor strategy:
Lux up, and add Mysterio for overkill.  Spell Focus and fire off a Desolator
to knock out all the Cubes.  Do it again if Belphegor is still alive while
your mage boosts up their AP.

Head back down to B2 via the lower set of stairs.  The upper right stairs,
marked D, are the easiest to get to, using that to get to the center, bigger
area.  The floor dips down to the stairs marked H, leading to B4.

This area no longer needs a Torch, if you were even using one.  Take the set
of stairs counterclockwise to a chest holding <X-POTION>, then speak to the
save character.  We're about to get to the final boss.

Except for the first time you get to floor B7, this entire area is linear.
The first time you do get to B7, go all the way to the left, then go all the
way to the bottom.  Continue your way to the vortex marked N to come face
to face with the final boss.  Mix up your shields between Holy and Darksteel
equips among the three not holding the Cape of Light.

Chaos strategy:
Lux, Mysterio and Spell Focus'd Desolator attacks are your friends.  Chaos
throws out some light and dark element spells, but tends to lean more towards
dark element spells here.  If you can squeeze in Amplify for those Desolator
attacks, do so.  Levels coming into this fight were between 49 and 50.

Chaos, Round 2      |   ~6300  | 777 |                   |

Chaos strategy, Round 2:
Hopefully this didn't come as a surprise, so you could bring your Lux user's
AP totals back to full during the previous fight.  Start with Lux and
Mysterio, again, but this time, keep an eye on your HP levels, since this form
of Chaos can deal out more damage than the previous one.  Desolator, powered
up with Spell Focus and Amplify, are still your best bets at doleing out
damage; I haven't run across a physical analogue that deals six different
~400 dmg hits every other turn, hence Desolator.  Chaos throws out more light
spells this time around, so those Holy Shield holders will get more of a break
this time around.

After the battle, we get a pep-talk from past characters and become fully
restored.  We have one last battle to go before the credits roll.

Enemy               |    HP    | Exp |        Gem        |       Item

Chaos' Right Hand   | 5541-621 |  0  |                   |
Chaos' Left Hand    | 4344-458 |  0  |                   |
Chaos' Face         |9332-10088| 999 |                   |

Chaos strategy, Round 3:
You have to beat the right hand, left hand, then face, in order.  You can't
even target a different part; likewise, the other parts can't attack until the
previous body part is dispatched.  Both the right and left hand parts are
similar to Chaos' second form, just with less HP, but capable of hitting
harder.  The face is what's new.  The face has an atack called Big Bang,
which is spammable.  With Lux up, expect to take around 100 dmg for all of
your characters.  If your Black Mage falls, it's going to be hard to revive
them and get them back behind a Lux, but make it a priority if you find
yourself in this situation.  Unlike in the previous rounds, your healer may
have had nothing to do and threw out an attack now and then, but that changes
here; keep them healing the whole party, either Lifegiver/Healthgiver Cure/as
or Healthcare X-Potion/Remedy.  After losing 60% of the face's HP, it'll
start casting Cura on itself, healing for around 400HP per use.  Two of the
six Desolator strikes should cancel that outright, so don't worry too much
about that, as long as your Black Mage is still alive.  Just be a little more
cautious here, and when in doubt from having a "free" action, heal.

When you see Bigger Bang being cast, you've won.  Take the magic circle out
to find yourself at the beginning of B5.  Head to the upper left to get back
to the spiral staircase area.  Talk to the dragon and we'll be on autopilot
for the endgame scenes.

Congrats on beating Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light!  After the credits,
you'll get a prompt to save.  If you're worried about losing anything that was
given out during *those* endgame scenes, don't worry, you'll still have it.


   ~ The Bonus Towers ~                                               [26cfaq]

You can begin this section as soon as you gain the Master Key from Rolan,
since gaining the Master Key also requires having gained Cestus.  I can't map
any of these areas out for you, since the layout changes each time.  There's
one set of stairs for each screen and your goal is to get to those stairs to
go up to the next floor.  Every now and then, you'll find random treasure
chests, too.

All of the towers thus far follow the same pattern.  Every 10 floors, you're
allowed to leave and save the game, so you can start the tower again where
you left off.  Speaking to the NPC outside of the tower can reset the tower
back to the first floor.

The pattern thus far is:
Floor 10: Boss; drops Amethysts
Floor 20: Empty floor
Floor 30: Boss; drops Diamond(s) and Amethysts
Floor 40: Shop


-- Moonsand Ruins; Tower 1 --

You can find this by flying North of the Witch's Mansion.

   Moonsand Ruins (Tower 1) General Shop, Floor 40
          X-Potion              400 G            Phoenix Down       100 G

          Unyielding Shield  100000 G            Antimage        100000 G
          Hide Shield        100000 G


-- Holy Tree Tower; Tower 2 --

You can find this only by using the whale, Cestus.  From Urbeth, go West to
slam into the Arbor coastline, and follow the coastline North, West, then
South.  Line up Cestus' icon with Arbor, then swim West.  You'll find a
crescent shaped island with a cave in the center.  This is the tower.

   Holy Tree Tower (Tower 2) General Shop, Floor 40
          X-Potion              400 G            Phoenix Down       100 G
          Hi-Ether            10000 G            Mooring Blade    22000 G
          Koga Shuriken       28000 G            Guan Yu's Pike   55000 G


-- Mysterious Lighthouse; Tower 3 --

Explore Liberte Town on top of Cestus.  It's that locked lighthouse at the
very top of town.

   Mysterious Lighthouse (Tower 3) General Shop, Floor 40
          X-Potion              400 G            Phoenix Down       100 G
          Hi-Ether            10000 G            Muramasa          9000 G
          Fuma Shuriken       28000 G            Shiranui         50000 G


-- Trial Tower; Tower 4 --

From Spelvia, fly West-Northwest, or fly North from Urbeth.  That's the tower.

October 13, 2010 - Completely redid Quicksand Castle's maps, adding a bunch
          of treasure chests in the process.  Missed a section in Spelvia
          Dungeons and added that, after the revisit.  Adding missing notes
          from my paper copy to Arbor's legend quest.  Added Spell Fencer,
          Paladin, Alchemist and Shaman Crown sections.  I just need to do
          them all at once, rather than restarting each quest anew.

October 14, 2010 - Needed to catch up and gain the weapons themselves.  Gained
          the Master Key, wasted time doing the non-existant sheep puzzle at
          the time of discovery.  Just noticed a sheep gate lock, so yay.

          Still tons to write up, though; getting through that.

October 17, 2010 - Finishing up last few maps, slowly adding Wireless weapon
          upgrade data.  Added three shops at the bonus towers.  Guide
          through to the end of the game, filling in the circle now.
