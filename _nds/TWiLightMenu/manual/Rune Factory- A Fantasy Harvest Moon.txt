OVERVIEW                                                LH-OVERVIEW
******************************************************************************
Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon is another franchise of the Harvest Moon
Series. The game is set in a medieval, fantasy world where you not only have
to plant and harvest crops, but also fight (as well as tame) the monsters in 
the dungeon. The game has a story to unravel, dungeons to discover, and many
people to interact with. Rune Factory also offers WiFi to exchange items with
your friends. Last, but not the least, you now have 11 bachelorettes to woo,
should you want to get married in this game.

******************************************************************************
The Game's Beginning                                    LH-BEGIN
******************************************************************************
At the beginning of the game, you are introduced with the main character about
to collapse on the road. Eventually, he collapsed, and a female character then
comes out from a house. The boy asks for some food and water, but somehow the
girl mistook them and instead, brought a hoe and a watering can! Anyways, the
girl finally understood, and offered food and water. After a few more talks, 
we discover that the boy has amnesia, so the girl offered to choose a name for
yourself. At this point, you can name him whatever you want, but for clarity's
sake, i'll refer him as Raguna from now on.

We also get to know the girl's name, Mist, and since Raguna's lost his memory,
Mist offered for him to stay at her farm. After that, follow her on the farm
and after a few more talks, a monster suddenly appears! You can use the hoe to
defeat it (or the watering can to drown it, hehe). Then we get to learn in the
game that we cannot kill the monsters, just send them back to their original
place, "The First Forest", since they come from a different world. After that,
Mist offers Raguna a place to work as thanks for saving her life. You have two
choices, but in reality, you only have one choice. Try it out for fun!

After the choices, you are also given the option for a quick overview on how
to plow the fields, growing vegetables, and information on your health points
(HP) and rune points (RP). Next, Mist gives you some turnip seeds, and you get
to name her farm. BTW, if you choose the default name, Mist will praise your
choice, but if you changed it, well, you get a different reaction. This ends
the beginning, and you are now free to do whatever you want in the game.

******************************************************************************
The Start Menu                                          LH-START
******************************************************************************
One of the most confusing aspect in Rune Factory is the Start Menu. Once you
access it for the first time, you are greeted with a menu containing an over-
whelming amount of information that you'll eventually get lost navigating it!
So, let's break it down to parts and see what it is.

Basically, the menu is composed of seven (7) categories. These are the ff:
******************************************************************************
Inventory (Sword and Shield Icon)                       LH-INVENTORY
******************************************************************************
This is the first menu you will see when you push the start button. It shows 
the level of your character, and below it is the amount needed to reach the 
next level. Next to that is your HP and RP in bar and numerical form. If you
are wondering what that empty box beside your HP and RP is, that box shows the
status, your character is inflicted with (see LH-STATUS).

The next line shows your stats in attack, defense, strength, intelligence, 
dexterity, and vitality. Something that is not present in Harvest Moon games.
Following that are four icons, with respective red and blue colored numbers.
The first icon signifies fire element, hence the red color. The blue icon is
for water element. The brown icon is for earth element. Lastly, the green icon
is air element. As for the red and blue numbers, the red number represents the
offense value, while the blue number represents the defense value associating
the said element.

As for the six grey-outed icons, they are slots for your character. The first
slot (sword icon) is used for your tools/weapons. The second slot (shield
icon) is for your shields. Third is the magic book slot (book icon) for your
magic spells. The fourth and fifth slot are for accessories. The sixth slot is
for items other than tools/weapons.

The fifteen (15) empty boxes represents the available space on your backpack,
with 3 slots more, giving a total of 45 available spaces. Each empty space can
hold a maximum of nine (9) of the same item. Weapons and accessories, however,
occupy a single empty space each.

******************************************************************************
Skills (Bottle and Hoe Icon)                            LH-SKILLS
******************************************************************************
The second category lists all the skills in the game. Skills in the game are
what consumes your rune points (RP) most of the time, be it farming, banishing
monsters, or even cooking. There are three types of skills. Physical skills 
increase with physical action. These are swordsmanship, mining, logging, 
farming, and fishing. Mental skills increase by combining items in the house.
These are pharmacy, forging, cooking, and decoration. Special skills are for
the last two, communication, and camping. Communication is a skill that raises
your friendship level with monsters. Camping is a skill for sleeping in places
like caves. The level indicates the number of times you can camp.

The higher the skill level, the lesser it consumes your rune points (RP) in
the game. But it's not that simple. See, better weapons have certain skill 
levels, that is why, it is essential to raise your level so that you can use
the item effectively in the game. Say, someone traded a luck blade which has a
skill level of 26. Your character will consume bigger amounts of RP if your 
skill level is below. Should you reach an equal level, the RP consumption 
should be on the ratio of 1:1 . The maximum skill level is 99. 

******************************************************************************
Friends (Animal Icon)                                   LH-FRIENDS
******************************************************************************
The third category is empty! Actually, it is filled with data once you tamed
a monster and you bring it with you in battle. The above screen shows the 
animation of the monster. Below screen shows the name you have given to the
monster. Below the name is the type of monster it belongs to. Next is the HP
of the monster, as well as it's attack and defense rating. Below that is the
friendship meter, and finally, the ability list of the said monster.

******************************************************************************
Farm (Turnip and Flower Icon)                           LH-FARM
******************************************************************************
The fourth category is your farm window. The above screen shows the name of 
the farm. Beside it shows the time, date, season, and status of the weather.
Below shows the year of the game as well as the season. Next is the amount of
money you possess. Below that shows the house level (max is 2), as well as the
number of monsters you currently have. Beside is the amount of wood you have,
and the amount of feeds in your monster huts.

The details found below screen shows the name of your monster, and what floor
and house it is located. The number of huts increases as you continue building
more and more monster huts (max is 7). Each hut can contain 4 monsters. If you
want, additional basements (max is 2) can be created on each monster hut,
raising the total number of available slots to 84 monsters.

******************************************************************************
Shipping History (Open Book Icon)                       LH-SHIPPING
******************************************************************************
The fifth category shows the amount you have gained by selling items via the 
shipping bin. It is further categorized by the following. Plants, vegetables,
and even fruits that can be bought in stores are found on the first tab. Rings
and bracelets, and most accessories are located on the second tab. Foods that
can be obtained via cooking, and even the ingredients themselves are in the
third tab. Items created in the pharmacy, as well as some items that can be
bought in the hospital is on the fourth tab. The fifth tab is for fishes. The
last tab is ETC. It's for items you miscellaneously received in the game. It
includes monster drops, even certain key items that is required for marriage 
can be sold via the shipping bin.

******************************************************************************
Friendliness (Two Hands Icon)                           LH-FRIENDLINESS
******************************************************************************
The sixth category shows the level of friendship you have with the townsfolk.
Only bachelorettes can have love points. Ordinary townsfolk will never have a
love value. The maximum points you can reach is 10.

******************************************************************************
Plot Items (Pad and Pen Icon)                           LH-PLOT
******************************************************************************
It's also empty! Not really. The last category shows you the plot items that
is available in the game. As you play along, you'll eventually fill this up.


******************************************************************************
Farming                                                 LH-FARMING
******************************************************************************
So, you've decided to farm, eh? Farming is the main source of income in Rune
Factory. You have a piece of farmland to use, and it's up to you to become the
master farmer of this game! Not only that, but this game also have farmland
inside dungeons! So, it's up to you if you want to use them or not.

******************************************************************************
Using Touch Screen                                      LH-FARMTOUCH
******************************************************************************
Rune Factory offers a fresh, new way to interact in farming. With the use of 
a stylus, you can command Raguna to work on your farm, saving you from using
the action button over and over again. To start with, the actions of Raguna
depends on the tools he is currently equipped (and activated) with. When he
has no tools, or if there is one but is not activated (by tapping it with the
stylus), any spot you touch on the farmland will move him to that spot. If an
item is on that spot, Raguna will pick it up and put it inside his backpack.
Stumps and Rocks are an exception, as they cannot be put in the backpack. When
the tool is selected by tapping it in the lower corner of the bottom screen
(it is activated when it changed to green) and you click on a spot, Raguna 
will perform the action of the said tool on that spot. An example would be to
select the axe, tap it with the stylus, then click a branch on the farmland.
Raguna will then move one square below to the spot and chop the branch.

<>NOTE<>
When using tools via the touch screen method. Make sure that there is a space
below the spot you want to execute the command. Otherwise, Raguna will never
complete the action.

<>NOTE 2<>
If you want to use charged tools in the game via touch screen method, tap on
the spot and then hold the action (B) button. By the time Raguna reaches the
spot, he will not perform the action immediately, but instead wait for the
action button to be released.

The touch screen method can remember at least nine (9) spots in the game. It
is very useful when harvesting, as it saves you the effort in picking up the
vegetable and storing it in your backpack.

Farming Basics                                          LH-FARMBASICS
******************************************************************************
This is just going to be a simple tutorial on how farming is done in the game.
First, clear the some debris on your farmland until you acquire a nice patch
on your farm. A 3x3 is an ideal size. Once you have that, select the hoe from
your inventory and till some soil. Till all those 3x3 squares until you are
done. Next, stand in the middle of your freshly tilled soil. Select some seeds
in your inventory (turnip seeds from Mist will do nicely), and spread them by
pressing the action (B) button. The seeds should appear on the newly tilled
soil. Lastly, select the watering can, refill it with water (via the pond) and
proceed to water each and every seeds on the ground. That's it. You're done on
the first step. The second step would be to water the seeds each day, until 
they can be harvested upon. If you want to plant more seeds, just repeat the
same process.

Farming QnA                                             LH-FARMQNA
******************************************************************************
Q. I did all that was written on the farming basics but on the next day, the
   seeds disappear! Why is this happening?
A. One explanation would be you are planting the seeds on the wrong season.
   Certain seeds only grow on certain seasons, and if you plant the seed on
   the wrong season, they would dissapear on the next day.

Q. I spread the wrong seed! How do i erase/remove them from the soil?
A. As far as i can tell, there is no method in removing the seeds once they
   are placed on the tilled soil. Not even fully-charged tools work. You just
   wasted a pack of seeds, i guess. Seeds are invulnerable in the game.

Q. I missed watering the seeds/plants! Will it wither and die?
A. Actually, it does not affect the growth of the plants in anyway, save that
   you just missed it on that day. If the plant needs five days to grow, and
   you missed watering them on the third day, watering them the next day is
   equivalent to a third day of growth of the plant.

Q. What is this Greenifier? And how do i use it in farming?
A. A greenifier is an item that can be bought in the Clinic. It's effect on 
   the seeds increases its level by one. To use the greenifier, position the 
   the cursor to a patch of seeds. Take out the greenifier and use it. There
   is no visual indication that the item is used, but when you harvest the
   crops, you should notice one crop with a higher level, separated from the 
   rest.
   <>NOTE<>
   Don't be greedy and drop multiple greenifiers on the same seed, even on 
   different days. It doesn't work that way.

Q. What is this formula A? And how do i use it in farming?
A. Formula A is another item that has its uses in farming. It shortens the 
   crop to ripen in 1 day. How to use the item is just the same as using the
   greenifier. You can also use this item after using the greenifier on the
   same day. That way, you get to harvest the crop a day earlier than the
   rest.
   <>NOTE<>
   Like the greenifier, don't be greedy and use multiple formula on the same
   seed on the same day. Wait for next day and you can use another formula on
   the same seed/plant.

Q. When the crops have fully grown, i see glowing spheres on the field. What
   are those?
A. My, those are the blessings of the earth! Just my guess though, but they
   are known in the game as rune spheres. In addition to successfully
   growing the crops, the game also rewards you with rune spheres. These
   spheres restores a bit of RP on your character, so it is best to grab them
   after utilizing your rune points in the game.
   <>NOTE<>
   Take note that when you have harvested the crops and leave the area, the
   rune spheres also disappears! So don't be silly and grab them when you have
   harvested the crops, instead of saving them and leaving the area, only to
   find that they have also disappeared.

Q. What is this level on my crops? I use a greenifier, and now, one of them is
   a higher level. What gives?
A. That is actually a good thing. Higher level crops have higher values than
   lower level crops. They raise the value by a factor of 1. So a level ten 
   crop nets ten times the amount compared to a level 1 crop.
   <>NOTE<>
   While theoretically, the highest level attainable in this game is 100, when
   you plant a lv100 seed, you'll only harvest lv10 crops. So having lv10 on
   your crops is already the maximum profit you can achieve.

Q. I hear phantom crops. Is this real?
A. Yep, phantom crops are real, though the way Mist said it is misleading. An
   accurate description for phantom crops, would be crops that exceeds the 
   number of days in a season for them to grow. Simply put, you'll mostly use
   the farmland found in dungeons for them to fully grow since phantom crops
   takes a really long time to grow. They are available after you beat the 
   storyline so don't expect them too soon.

Types Of Seeds                                          LH-SEEDTYPES
******************************************************************************
Seeds are the main ingredient in a farmer's life. Without them, there would be
no crops in the game. Seeds are categorized by seasons. Seeds can be bought in
the Seed Shop. After beating the storyline, phantom crops are unlocked. The
(R) indicates that the crop regrows over time. The regrowth rate is also put
in parentheses.

Farm Tools                                              LH-TOOLS
******************************************************************************
You need farming equipments when you want to pursue the career of farming in
the game. At the start of the game, Mist gives you a hoe and a watering can 
for farm use. Honestly, these two are all you gonna need in basic farming. But
like everything else in this game, the starter tools are just the tip of the
iceberg. You are going to have to upgrade your tools to maximize their use. I
have listed all the farming tools available in the game. Oh, and they can be
used as weapons in the dungeon, but it's not very effective.

Hoe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hoe is used to till the soil so that seeds can be planted. Find an empty 
patch of farmland, and use a hoe. A tilled soil will appear on the spot.
Using the hoe gradually increases your farming skill.

Level 1 - Cheap Hoe    = 1 tilled soil
Level 2 - Sturdy Hoe   = 3 tilled soil when charged
Level 3 - Seasoned Hoe = a 3x3 area of tilled soil when charged
Level 4 - Shiny Hoe    = a 3x6 area of tilled soil when charged
Level 5 - Blessed Hoe  = a 3x9 area of tilled soil when charged
 

Watering Can
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The watering can is the second farming tool you'll receive on the game. Use it
on a tilled soil, and the soil will then be damp. Essential in raising crops.
Using the watering can gradually increases your farming skill.

Level 1 - Cheap Waterpot    = 1 area. Hold 12 units
Level 2 - Tinplate Waterpot = 3 areas across when charged. Holds 24 units
Level 3 - Lion Waterpot     = 3x3 area when charged. Holds 54 units
Level 4 - Rainbow Waterpot  = 5x5 area when charged. Holds 100 units
Level 5 - Joy Waterpot      = 9x9 area when charged. Holds 162 units

Axe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OBTAIN: visit Jasper's Manor and talk to Bianca. Bianca will then call
               on Tabitha to fetch the item.

An axe is an essential farming equipment. It is used to cut branches, stumps,
and is your only source of wood in the game. Branches give 1 wood while the
stumps give 10. The maximum amount of wood you can reach is 9999. You can also
use the chopped wood to make fences and such. The log shed is located beside
the pond. All axes can cut branches. Using the axe does not increase farming
skills, but instead raises the logging skill.

Level 1 - Cheap Axe      = mainly for branches. doesn't work on stumps
Level 2 - Chopping Axe   = stumps take 6 hits when charged
Level 3 - Lumber Axe     = stumps take 3 hits when charged
Level 4 - Mountain Axe   = stumps take 2 hits when charged
Level 5 - Miracle Axe    = stumps take 1 hit when charged

Sickle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OBTAIN: Visit the Seed Shop and talk to Rosetta, but before she gives
               the item, you need to till at least 50 patches of farmland.

The sickle can be used to cut plants and weeds on your farm. Personally, the 
only real benefit of the sickle is when cutting grass for fodder. Otherwise,
it can also be used to clean out your farmland against withered crops. Using
the sickle also increases your farming skill.

Level 1 - Cheap Sickle   = cuts 1 area
Level 2 - Iron Sickle    = cuts 3 areas horizontally when charged
Level 3 - Quality Sickle = cuts 3x3 area when charged
Level 4 - Super Sickle   = cuts 5x5 area when charged
Level 5 - Legend Sickle  = cuts 9x9 area when charged

Hammer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OBTAIN: Visit the Blacksmith Shop and talk to Leo, but before he gives
               the item, you need to have a pass on the first cave, and till
               at least 50 patches of farmland inside the cave.

While hammer is mainly used for mining ores, it also has its uses in the farm.
A hammer is used to untill soils and return them back to normal. While this 
may not sound so useful to a farmer, by turning the soil back to normal, this
encourages the game to spawn wild items on the farmland. Be it branches, or
weeds, rocks, stumps, boulders, etc. Using the hammer raises the mining skill,
not the farming skill, even when untilling soils. All hammers can effectively
break stones with 1 hit.

Level 1 - Cheap Hammer    = cannot break rocks and boulders.
Level 2 - Iron Hammer     = break rocks in 1 hit when charged. no to boulders
Level 3 - Silver Hammer   = rocks in 1 hit, boulders in 3 hits when charged
Level 4 - Golden Hammer   = rocks in 1 hit, boulders in 2 hits when charged
Level 5 - Platinum Hammer = rocks and boulders in 1 hit when charged

Fishing Rod
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OBTAIN: Go to the beach and approach the end of the pier. Sabrina will
               appear and gives you the item.

Fishing Rod is not really an essential item in farming. Heck, you don't even
need it. It is an item all on its own. Seek a body of water, and you can use
the fishing rod to catch any type of fish, even junk. It can be an alternative
way to earn money, and is also the easiest, fastest way to earn money early in
the game. Using the fishing rod raises your fishing skill.

Level 1 - Cheap Rod  = catches common fishes
Level 2 - Bamboo Rod = boosts chance to catch level 2 fishes
Level 3 - Willow Rod = boosts chance to catch level 3 fishes
Level 4 - Famous Rod = boosts chance to catch level 4 fishes
Level 5 - Sacred Rod = boosts chance to catch level 5 fishes

Tool Upgrades                                           LH-TOOLUPGRADE
******************************************************************************
Upgrading your tools is a must to improve the efficiency of your farm tools.
In the game, there is a Blacksmith Shop which can raise your tool level up to
3. The last 2 levels requires a forgery inside your house. The materials for
the upgrade usually requires minerals that can be mined, but higher levels do
require items dropped from monsters, so it might take a while to find them.

Spelunking                                              LH-DUNGEON
******************************************************************************
HOW TO OBTAIN: You can obtain a permit from Godwin, the mayor of the town, but
               before he gives you one, you are required to till 100 patches
               of farmland.

Spelunking, or exploring the caves is another feature in Rune Factory. There
are a total of eight different locations that are considered dungeons in the
game. In each cave, contains a permanent weather condition, so you can plant
and harvest crops specific to the conditions of the cave. Be extra careful!
since dungeons contain monsters and can kill your main character. Of course,
you can buy weapons or use the farming tools themselves to "banish" them back
to their homeland. Also, defeating monsters raises the level of your character
so it's a good idea to defeat them rather than avoid fighting them. Caves are
unlocked after defeating the boss of the previous cave, so there are no short
cuts in reaching the different caves available in the game.

               the game. One is to Till at least 100 patches of farmland on

               at least 10 monsters in your farm. If you fulfill these two, 
               Godwin should give you the permit to this dungeon.
BOSS         : Golum  (1680 HP)


Danann Cave  (Fall Season)

               issue the permit to this cave without too much fuss.
BOSS         : Battle Tank  (2000 HP)


Greed Cave  (Summer Season)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO OBTAIN: Just defeat the boss of the last dungeon, and the mayor should

******************************************************************************
Character Status                                        LH-STATUS
******************************************************************************
During your stay in the caves, you will undoubtedly aqcuire status changes
while battling monsters. Status changes affects the efficiency of Raguna in
the game. Some deplete HP, others impede movement, and others shuts down your
magic. Some status changes can kill you, so take medicine as soon as possible
when your character is afflicted with status changes.

Of course, status changes are not limited in spelunking. There are also status
changes when farming. Sleeping past 1:00am nets you tiredness and then some. 
So it's a good idea to give your character adequate rest in the game.

Poison       = drains your character's (or your monster's) HP.
Paralysis    = character cannot run.
Seal         = character cannot use spells. Charging weapons do not work.
Cold         = Sleeping past 1:00am. RP cost is doubled.
Illness      = Sleeping past 1:00am with a cold. RP cost is tripled.

******************************************************************************
Healing Status Changes                                  LH-STATHEAL
******************************************************************************
Status changes can be healed in a variety of ways. As a general rule, anything
can be cured by visiting the doctor's clinic and perform a checkup. Otherwise,
medicinal items, or even healing magic can be used to remove status changes.

Poison       = Medication Spell, Antidote
Paralysis    = Medication Spell, Paragon
Seal         = Roundoff
Cold         = Cold Medicine, Sleep
Illness      = Cold Medicine, Sleep

******************************************************************************
Monster and You                                         LH-MONSTERS
******************************************************************************
The monsters in the game can be used as an alternate source of income on your
farm. But before you can do that, you are to befriend them first. Befriending
the monsters takes some time, so be extra careful or risk dying the game.
Also, you cannot sell your monsters, only release them back to First Forest.


Monster Tools (build a Monster Hut first before getting the items)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friendship Glove :  Find Tabatha and talk to her. She will give the friend
                    ship glove. Use the glove to befriend the monsters. You
                    do not necessarily have to build a Monster Hut, just a
                    friendship level of 2 to Tabatha is enough.
Brush            :  Once you have successfully captured any type of monster, 
                    head over to Neumann's house and talk to Felicity. She
                    will give the item to you.
Gathering Basket :  Once you have successfully captured any monster that can
                    produce honey or eggs, talk to Neumann at his store. He
                    will give the item to you.
Shears/Clippers  :  Capture Woolly! The only monster capable of producing furs
                    in the game. Once captured, talk to Camus and he will 
                    give the item for free.
Milker           :  Once you have successfully captured any monster, you can
                    obtain this item by talking to Jasper in his mansion.


On your first encounter with monsters, they will try and kill you! So equip a
tool and banish them back to First Forest! You will also notice a machine that
respawns the monsters again and again, so it is a priority to destroy it as 
soon as possible. Consequentially, destroying all the monster machines on the
cave unlock the door to the monster boss of the game. Make sure you are well
prepared to tackle the boss or run the risk of dying in the game.

There are two categories of monsters available on the game. One are fighting
type monsters. Fighting type monsters are monsters that specialises in dealing
damages to enemies. Bring them when spelunking and they will attack any near
monsters on the cave. Some can even be ridden, enabling faster movement on
the map. The other is farming type monsters. Monsters belonging to this type
can aid you in your farm. Some are even useful when you bring them in dungeons
as they can cast cure to heal your character.

Monster Care and Produce                                LH-MONCARE 
******************************************************************************
Taking care of monsters rewards you with produce that you can sell via the
shipping bin. You can also use such produce as ingredients in cooking, or in
other skills such as forging and pharmacy. On some monsters, the key to having
their best produce is to increase their friendship level. Use the brush on the
monsters to increase their friendship level. Once they reach maximum level of
friendship, you do not have to brush them anymore. Monsters produce every 4
days. 

Monsters also needs feeds. You can buy feeds in either of the two stores. You
can also produce your own feeds by planting grazing grass on the field. After
9 days, you can use your sickle to cut them, and they are automatically stored
in your monster huts. One patch of grass gets distributed to your monster huts
so if you have 7 huts, each hut gets one unit of grass.

<>Note<> That if you have no feeds, the friendship level of your monsters go 
         down, so make sure to check on the amount of feeds left on each hut 
         via the start menu.

<>NOTE<>
While this is just a personal preference, offensive magic is largely useless
in the game because it consumes a fixed amount of RP. And you get to rarely
use them as you would prefer to swing your sword from your enemies instead.
They would take up space on your shelves where it can be used for other items
instead. My recommendation?  Save before you buy.


Pub Spring Rabbit
A game would not be complete without a place where people drink and be merry.
That's where this bar comes in. Interestingly, Emmett is also a self-confessed
alcoholic, but what surprises me are the items he sells. Only a bottle of wine
for a bar is hardly a choice for alcoholic enthusiasts. Anyways, you can buy 
most of the ingredients needed for cooking in this place.

Walkthrough                                             LH-WALKTHROUGH
******************************************************************************
I intend to make this walkthrough as spoiler-free as possible so that you can
enjoy the storyline. As you may notice, the story progresses as you conquer
the caves in the game. It is not necessary to rush at the caves or risk being
killed in the game. The safest way to beat the boss is to gain enough levels
so that you will not have a hard time defeating them. I am more of a passive
player than an aggressive one, so i usually gain more levels than necessary to
defeat the boss in the cave. Obtaining passes has already been outlined above
so only survival tips are given on this section.


Carmite Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You shoudn't have any trouble on the first accessible cave of the game. Just
don't die, and you should be fine. Try to raise your level around 15 or so.
By the time you reach the second area, Ivan will appear and gives you a device
that detects the machines in the area. Also, when you reach the last level of
the cave, Zavier will appear and gives his sleeping bag to you. Destroy the
last machine and enter the door to fight the monster boss.

BOSS      :  Greater Daemon
HP        :  250       MAGIC DEF  :  17
DEF       :  6         EARTH DEF  :  30       FIRE DEF  :  30
                       WATER DEF  :  30       WIND DEF  :  30

ATTACKS   :  Arm Swing    -  he will swing his arms to hit you.
             Charge       -  he will stay put and flings his arms on his
                             chest. Then he will charge at you.
             Earth Spikes -  he will raise spikes from the ground.

STRATEGY  :  Make sure you are well-equipped when fighting this boss. Bring
     some potions too just to be safe. Stay away from him to avoid his arm
     swing. Start running when he's about to charge to avoid it. It's best to
     attack him right after he charges towards you as he will stay put for a
     few moments. When he starts to glow, that means he is near defeat. It is
     inportant to defeat him as soon as possible, since his attacks will be
     faster. You'll receive no items when you defeat him.


Toros Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toros Cave shouldn't be too different on the last cave, other than tougher and
higher level enemies. Raise your level around 30s, but if you're confident of
your skills, go ahead and proceed to defeat the monster boss at a lower level.
There aren't any puzzles to unlock so just make sure to search every nook and
cranny to find and destroy the machines.

BOSS      :  Chimera
HP        :  460       MAGIC DEF  :  20
DEF       :  7         EARTH DEF  :  30       FIRE DEF  :  70
                       WATER DEF  :  80       WIND DEF  :  30

ATTACKS   :  Lunge        -  he will scratch the ground and lunges at you.
             Water Razor  -  he will shoot two beams from his head.
             Freeze       -  he will breath a frozen gas towards you.
    (low HP) Water Razor  -  there will be 4 beams instead of 2.

STRATEGY  :  You did bought some new swords in the blacksmith shop, did you?
     Anyways, this boss shouldn't be too tough to beat. He will lazily walk
     around the room until he sees fit to attack you. Lunge is easy to dodge,
     and it has limited range. Water Razor occurs when you are far from him,
     and also easy to dodge, When freeze breath is used against you, just run
     away as far from it as possible. It's best to attack him when it's moving
     around. When he glows, he becomes faster, and there are now four lasers
     to dodge instead of two. Defeat him to unlock the next cave.


Clemens Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the event, head west and follow the road down. You should find what you
are searching for. Inside the cave, you'll find plenty of flames scattered
around. Some might get confused on how to get past them, but just whip out
your watering can and douse those flames away. Other than that, there are no
puzzles to unlock, so find all those machines and destroy them.

BOSS      :  Rafflesia
HP        :  780       MAGIC DEF  :  10
DEF       :  8         EARTH DEF  :  40       FIRE DEF  :  15
                       WATER DEF  :  80       WIND DEF  :  40

ATTACKS   :  Left Stalk   -  produces Queen Bee monsters.
             Right Stalk  -  casts Swordstorm across the room.
             Top Stalk    -  sprays Paralysis Gas towards your character.
             Bottom Stalk -  summons Killer Ant monsters

STRATEGY  :  By this time, you can buy a parasite ring in the Material Items
     Shop to decrease the chances of being paralyzed in that breath attack.
     You can also buy and equip the silent ring to decrease the chances of
     being sealed when attacked by killer ants. Just hack away at it, and run
     when it's attacking the gas. Kill the monsters and continue attacking it
     and it should fall down.


Mt. Gigant
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mt Gigant is not a cave per se, but a vast mountain area. As with Clemens Cave
you will also encounter the flames, so use the watering can for them. You can
capture a Buffamoo and a Cockadoodle in this area, so it's your choice. Locate
and destroy all the machines to unlock the door to the boss.

BOSS      :  Grimoa   
HP        :  999       MAGIC DEF  :  16
DEF       :  10        EARTH DEF  :  50       FIRE DEF  : 100 
                       WATER DEF  :  15       WIND DEF  :  60

ATTACKS   :  Dragon Breath -  breaths fire from its mouth.
             Tail Sweep    -  uses the tail to attack you.
             Dragon Bite   -  bites you. 
    (low HP) Luftmesa      -  wind blades scattered towards you.
    (low HP) Inferno       -  fire based attack. Ground covered in flames.

STRATEGY  :  Based on the stats, water-based spells and equipments will deal
     more damage than standard equipments. As with any dragons in any game,
     Grimoa is no exception. He is fire-based. Has the bite and tail sweep
     attack. And the patented fire breath attack. Something that you would
     expect from a dragon. Don't stay too close or he'll bite you. Stay on his
     back and he'll do a tail sweep. So stay close on his side and hack away.
     When he glows, be careful as his arsenal is added with two devastating
     spells. Stay focused, stick to his side and you should win over him.


Misty Bloom Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a short, and small cave, compared to the previous caves you spelunked.
Also, this cave is only accessible in Winter, making this cave exclusive to
winter season only. Destroy all machines to get access to the boss of the cave

BOSS      :  Siren   
HP        :  1300      MAGIC DEF  :  10
DEF       :  9         EARTH DEF  :  30       FIRE DEF  :  80 
                       WATER DEF  : 100       WIND DEF  :  15

ATTACKS   :  Siren Song    -  notes fly across the screen. Can paralyze.
             Water Laser   -  two beams of water attack.
             Summon Aid    -  siren summons a monster that has the one beam
                              Water Laser and Luftmesa spell.
    (low HP) Water Laser   -  four beams instead of two beams towards you.
    (low HP) Cure          -  restores HP.

STRATEGY  :  This is going to be one of those weak bosses that is extremely
     annoying to defeat. That is, because your avenue of attack would be only
     one of the four points around the ring of land. Bring lots of medicinal
     items that restores your health if you're having trouble. Also equip a
     parasite ring to minimize the chances of being paralyzed on that Siren
     Song. Use swords with high wind-based element, to inflict more damage to
     the enemy. When she glows, the time she will stay on one of the 4 points
     decreases so be quick. Eventually, you'll defeat her with skills (or with
     luck). Honestly, if you're having difficulty, raise your level some more.
     It's the only sure way to defeat her.


Kasimir Ruins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take note of the requirements of this cave. Not only will you have to secure a
permit from the mayor of the town, but also gain favor with Sharron. Take a
look-see on the requirements listed earlier on this guide. This time, locked
doors are introduced in the dungeon. Read the clue, and if you still have no
idea what that means, you're in luck. I'm feeling generous so i'll tell you.
In the same room with the locked door, you should find a patch of farmland. 
You are required to plant crops in ALL of them so that rune spheres can be
generated. Once the runes are generated, the door will be unlocked. Proceed
below and you are greeted on the same locked door as before, but this time, it
will be different. Instead of rune spheres, you are required to find the key,
so here's what you do. After exploring the area of the second locked door, go
back outside and talk to Sharron. She will mention about a Golum. Now go back
to the area of the first locked door, and go right through the open doorway.
You should trigger a fight scene with a Golum. Defeat it to obtain the Golum
Key. The rest would be to defeat the machines to unlock the door of the boss.

BOSS      :  Golum    
HP        :  1680      MAGIC DEF  :   6
DEF       :  11        EARTH DEF  :  30       FIRE DEF  :  50 
                       WATER DEF  :  30       WIND DEF  :  20

ATTACKS   :  Rocket Punch  -  arm detaches and punches towards you.
             Earth Cannon  -  uses his shoulder cannon and fire rocks.
             Whirlwind     -  he spins his arms around his body.

STRATEGY  :  Use ranged Attacks! This is where your charged attacks will come
     in handy. Golum looks like a big robot, so if you are expecting robotlike
     attacks from him, you are right. He's got the robot punch, the robot
     missiles, too bad no blazing sword. Ok, so just dodge the robot punch,
     stay far away when he does the earth cannon, and just attack him in range
     and he should fall down like a robot. Oh, and because he's a robot, his
     attacks can topple your character, so be very careful. Craft some items
     that decreases the chance of toppling, and you should be okay.


Danann Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danann Cave will be a mix of sorts from the previous caves you visited. There
will be locked gates that require rune spheres and key so let's find it. The
first locked gate you'll encounter requires rune spheres, so explore the area
and there should be a path blocked by flames. Douse them using the watering
can and you should find some farmland. Use the farmland and generate some rune
spheres to unlock the door. The second locked gate requires a key. Read the
clue left behind, and head back to the beginning of the cave. The farmland
you are looking for lies on the west part of the area. Dig... err till the
soil until you find the key. Use the key to unlock the second gate. 

BOSS      :  Battle Tank   
HP        :  2000      MAGIC DEF  :  40
DEF       :  12        EARTH DEF  :  80       FIRE DEF  :  80 
                       WATER DEF  :  20       WIND DEF  :  80

ATTACKS   :  Flame Sweep   -  the tank shoots flames on its sides.
             Main Cannon   -  fires a beam of water laser attack.
    (low HP) Beam Cannon   -  fires a huge beam from the main cannon.

STRATEGY  :  Notice the tracks? Good, because the Battle Tank will only appear
     on those tracks. See those stats? It would be a good idea to use swords
     without elements because it won't do any decent damage to the tank. Stay
     off the tracks and keep moving so that the cannon cannot accurately lock
     on to you. The flames should be easy to dodge also. The most you'll be
     worrying is how to damage the tank, as it has somewhat high defense,
     especially to elemental weapons. Attack it until the main cannon shell is
     blown to bits. Unfortunately, it also unveils its secret weapon. The beam
     cannon. Just watch as it recharges twice, and dodge when it fires the
     beam. The flame sweep also becomes aggresive, so watch out for it too.
     Hack it until it is destroyed.

Greed Cave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only catch in this cave is the teleport pad at the very end of the cave.
It will not function until you have destroyed all the machines on the cave. If
you have successfully done so, you are teleported to another room to fight the
last boss of the game. Oh, and raise your levels decently. I would suggest to
around 70~75 level. But you can beat the game with a lower level, just make
sure to use some of the best items available in the game.

BOSS      :  Grimoire   
HP        :  2600      MAGIC DEF  :  12
DEF       :  12        EARTH DEF  :  60       FIRE DEF  :  60 
                       WATER DEF  :  60       WIND DEF  :  60

ATTACKS   :  Lightning Bolt -  5 bolts strike the ground. Can paralyze.
             Tail Sweep     -  uses the tail to attack you.
             Fireball Sweep -  fireballs spread in front of the beast. 
             Divine Beam    -  a beam of concentrated light from its mouth.
             Divine Breath  -  can inflict poison.
    (low HP) Lightning Bolt -  10 instead of 5. Can paralyze.

STRATEGY  :  This is it! Defeat this boss, and you have successfully completed
     the storyline of the game. Being the last boss, it doesn't hold its punch
     and will definitely use his advantages to bring demise to our hero. But
     that's not what we want. So here goes. Dodge the bolts by marking where
     it will strike and immediately move away from the spot. Also, you cannot
     attack the Grimoire when it is airborne, so wait for it to come down. It
     will come down eventually, so that is your avenue of attack. The fireball
     sweep can be dodged by staying between the gaps or stay at his back, but
     watch out for the tail sweep. His breath attacks are also devastating so
     it is imperative that you do not take this boss head-on! Stick sideways
     just as you did on the Grimoa in Mt. Gigant. With skill and a little bit
     of luck, you should be able to defeat it.
