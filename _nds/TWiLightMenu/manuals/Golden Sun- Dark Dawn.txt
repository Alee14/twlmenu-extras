Hello everyone! This is my
newest FAQ for yet another great
RPG, this time it is Golden Sun:
Dark Dawn. Like most of you,
I've been waiting for this game
for a very long time. I'm an
enormous fan of the first two
Golden Suns, and I was happy to
hear that there's going to be a
continuation to the series. This
RPG is very solid, and, in my
opinion, is one of the better
RPGs on the DS, probably even
the last great RPG on the
system. The game picks up 30
years after the first two games
in the series left off. You'll
be controlling Matthew, Isaac's
descendant, who tries to save
Weyard from the enigmatic and
mysterious Psynergy vortexes
along with his friends Karis and
Tyrell. He will also meet many
new friends and comrades on his
way. You'll see new places of
the Angara continent (since it's
the only continent that is
available to explore in this
game), and battle new foes. All
in all, this game truly
delivers, and I'm delighted to
write a walkthrough for it. I
hope that you'll enjoy playing
Golden Sun: Dark Dawn as much as
I enjoyed writing this guide!

This walkthrough contains only
slight spoilers, like location
and boss names. I will also
mention the points in the game
when certain characters join
your party. However, I will not
reveal any critical plot
details, and will only stick to
direct documenting of all the
things you can do in this game.

================================
PROLOGUE........................
================================


Long ago, the ancients of Weyard
     discovered the secrets of A

     They found that all life in
was based on the four elements:
  earth, wind, fire and water.

  They used their knowledge of
  Alchemy to forge a dazzling
civilization from the elements.

  And the ancients made their
   wildest dreams come true.

       And then began the
     nightmare of Alchemy.

Abuses of Alchemy threatened to

 They sealed away the power of
Alchemy so no one could use it.

  Civilization was saved, but
   the physical world itself
   began to die a slow death.

    For the ancients didn't
    realize that Alchemy was
   what held Weyard together.

 Without the force of Alchemy,
     lands went barren, seas wen

After the lenghty inrtoduction
and the opening scene, you'll
gain control of Matthew, the
main character. Try to run
around for a bit, open the menu,
get yourself familiar with the
controls. Or just climb the
ladder to get on the roof of the
house for another scene.
Approach Tyrell for another
sequence of scenes.


================================
LOOKOUT CABIN...................
================================

.-------------------------------
| Items & Djinni |
|-------------------------------
| • Short Sword |
| • Sun Saga 1                  
| • Padded Gloves |
| • Herb                        
'-------------------------------

Inside the house, Karis will
give you a [LEATHER CAP]. You'll
watch a little equipment
tutorial. Karis will also save
your game in the travel log.
Open the nearby chest for a
[SHORT SWORD] and climb the
ladder. Examine one of the book
shelves to find [SUN SAGA 1]. Go
upr the stairs and open the
chest to find [PADDED GLOVES].
Equip both the sword and the
gloves, then talk to Karis. She
will join you. Exit the cabin,
go left and examine one of the
pots there for a [HERB]. Head
right for a scene.


================================
GOMA PLATEAU....................
================================

.-------------------------------
|               Enemies         
|-------------------------------
| • Slime                       
| • Flutter Seed |
'-------------------------------

Go all the way right, and Isaac
will tell you to enter the cave.
Once there, Isaac and Garet will
stop you near the entrance.
You'll fight your first battle.
Follow the only path, slide down
and jump over the gaps. Try to
use the "Move" Psynergy on the
pillar to trigger a scene. After
a Psynergy lecture approach the
pillar and push it left or right
to make it fall using "Move".
Jump over the nearby gaps and
touch a Psynergy stone to
restore your PP. Exit the cave
in the southeast. Follow the
path down and move the pillar to
the right. Go back and jump over
it. Continue your path forward
for one more scene here. Keep
going northeast to reach
Tanglewood.


================================
TANGLEWOOD......................
================================

.-------------------------------
|             Items & Djinni    
|-------------------------------
| • Herb                        
| • Bramble Seed | • Flutter
Seed |
| • Elixir                      
'-------------------------------
          | • Rat Soldier       
          '---------------------

After a Djinni tutorial and a
couple of battles, Isaac and
Garet will join the team.
Although you can't command them
directly in battle, they still
fight alongside you. They'll
give you six Djinni. Go north
and right at the fork, make a
U-turn and over the water to get
to a chest with [HERB]. Go north
after that and make your way
northeast to get to a chest with
a [BRAMBLE SEED]. Run around
this spot to trigger a scene. Go
back a bit and approach the big
red flower. After the scene, go
north to find another red
flower. You should have at least
one Mars Djinn in Matthew's
possession, so that he obtains
the "Fire ball" Psynergy. Use it
on the flower and proceed to the
right. Run over the green bushes
and go northeast. You'll see a
little vine here (looks like a
leaf). Stand as close to it as
you can and use the "Growth"
Psynergy on it (Matthew should
have it). Now go southeast and
head southwest to get to the red
flower. Burn it with "Fireball".
Get on the green bushes again
and move northeast, jumping from
one bush to another. Climb the
vine and shoot the red flower
with "Fireball". Climb down and
run northeast, then west to the
next area. Push both pillars
into the water. Jump east for a
chest with [ELIXIR]. Jump north
and use "Move" on the pillar to
make it fall in the water. Use
"Growth" on the vine and
approach the mine cave for a
scene.


================================
ABANDONED MINE..................
================================

.-------------------------------
|               Enemies         
|-------------------------------
| • Wild Wolf                   
| • Rat Soldier |
| • Willowisp                   
'-------------------------------

Follow the path forward until
you run into a vine. Use
"Growth" on it, climb it and
follow the descending path to
the exit for another scene.
After it, run north and then
west. Use "Growth" on the vine
and go up a bit. Descend the
vine and approach the giant
flower. Heal yourself if needed,
and save your game. When ready,
toss a fireball at the beast.

| BOSS: Tangle Bloom            
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 145               
| Gold: 77                      
| Item Drop: Psy Crystal        
|-------------------------------
| If you're level 5 like me, you
should have no real problems
with this | | battle, since
Isaac and Garet are helping you
out. This makes the fight | |
pathetically easy. Tangle Bloom
mostly does physical attacks,
and rarely | | uses the Bramble
Seed attack, and even more
rarely - Phantom Spore, which |
| can cause delusion on your
characters. Regular attacks are
fine for this | | battle, since
Garet and Isaac will be doing
the Djinn-summoning job here. |
| This is more of a training
boss battle, I guess. |
'-------------------------------

Make your way to Tyrell. After
the conversation, go west and
follow the path outside for a
scene. Back in the Lookout
Cabin, you'll watch a long scene
that officially opens your
journey. In the Goma Plateau,
take the nearby path down and
exit to the overworld. A [VENUS
DJINNI "FLINT"] will join you
right away. That's your first
Djinni here, so be gentle with
it.. hehe... Proceed west and
enter the nearby town, the
Patcher's Place.

| • Mars Djinni "Forge" |
'-------------------------------

Head west, check the barrel for
some coins, and enter the store
for a scene. After it, go behind
the counter and open the chest
with [POWER BREAD]. Talk to
Patcher from across the counter,
and he'll tell you about his
shop. After buying some new
equipment, go west and enter the
lower door. You'll find a barrel
with a [HERB] there. Go back, up
the stairs and right. Outside,
check the barrel for an
[ELIXIR]. Head into the door on
the right, and search the pot
for an [ANTIDOTE]. Go up the
stairs, and west to the edge
into the north west house. Check
the bookshelf to find [SUN SAGA
2]. Go down and check the barrel
for a [SMOKE BOMB]. Go east and
enter the house to get some
coins from the drawer. To the
left of the house, you'll find a
vine. Use "Growth" on it to make
a shortcut and head back to the
upper part of the town. Start
climbing the mountain.


================================
PSYNERGY TRAINING GROUNDS.......
................................
.........DDWT7
================================

You'll see four pillars and a
tree in front of you. Move the
far right pillar to the left,
northmost one to the south four
times. And finally, move the
third pillar around the tree to
position it in line with the
other two. Climb the tree and
jump over the pillars. Run east
and climb down another tree. Use
"Growth" on the vine and climb
down to the next screen. You'll
find the [MARS DJINNI "FORGE"]
here. Return to the training
grounds and talk to the old guy
near the entrance. Agree to
undergo the test of your
abilities. Remember, there's a
boss in the end of this trial,
so you should be at least level
7 to feel comfortable. You'll
have 10 minutes for each of the
four tests.

Test 1 (Mercury Area) Go north
and cast "Fireball" at the
white-blue picture. Go east and
push the forst log to the right.
Move the pillar to the right and
push the bottom log there.
Finally, push the middle log up
and head east. Climb the tree
and shoot a "Fireball" at the
picture. Go east and move both
pillar on the geysers. Stand on
the middle geyser to be
trampolined to the top. Shoot
the picture to finish the first
test.

Test 2 (Venus Area) Go north and
use "Whirlwind" on the nearby
wind-vane. Use "Whirlwind" on
the one behind it, too. Now run
to the northeast corner and use
"Whirlwind" on the wind-vane
there. Go back to the beginning
of this area and hop into the
cart. After taking a ride in it,
jump to the left and shoot three
pictures with "Fireball". Jump
left, over the logs and finally
cast "Growth" on the vine. Climb
up and shoot both pictures to
finish the test.

Test 3 (Jupiter Area) Go north,
up the logs and cast "Whirlwind"
on the wind-vane. Jump to the
right and pull all three pillars
to the left using "Move".
Continue right, and jump to the
south. Hop onto the floating
crates. You need to move three
pillars to release the switches.
Once you've done that, shoot the
three pictures with "Fireball"
to open the path east. Cast
"Whirlwind" on the wind-vane,
then hit the picture with
"Fireball" again.

Test 4 (Mars Area) Melt the ice
pillar with "Fireball", and jump
over the puddle. Push the log to
the left, then jump north, left
and get behind the log. Push it
east sp that it lands in the
water. Melt 3 ice pillars that
are stuck between the crates and
go to the right. Cast
"Whirlwind" on the wind-vane,
then go up the stairs and west.
Use the pillar to shield
yourself from the flames.
Continue east, and shoot the ice
pillars with "Fireball" from
different heights. Use "Growth"
on the vine and climb it.
Finally, burn the pictures in
the end and prepare to face a
boss.

.-------------------------------
| BOSS: Dim Dragon              
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 179               
| Gold: 60                      
| Item Drop: Nut                
|-------------------------------
| I guess that GS: The Lost Age
players are familiar with who
this guy tries | | to resemble.
Anyway, it's a pretty easy boss,
since it uses primarily weak | |
attacks like Sizzle Breath or
Pebble Breath. They hit more
than one party | | member, but
the damage is minimal. It can
also use Scary Jinx spell, that
| | inflicts Curse on one
character, but I guess you
should be able to kill it | |
before the spell works. If
you're having trouble with this
Dragon, consider| | gaining a
couple of level, but I guess
level 6-7 should do the job. |
'-------------------------------

Whichever chest you decide to
open, you'll still get a [GATE
CARD]. It's a very important
item which we'll need a little
bit later. You can go through
the trials again and you'll get
a [WATER OF LIFE] from the
second chest.

Exit Patcher's Place to the
south, and go southeast. Soon
enough you'll reach the Goma
Highlands Road.

'-------------------------------

Go north, up the stairs, and
jump over the little river near
the sign. Now use "Whirlwind" on
the flower petal between the
tree and the eminence. Climb the
tree and jump to the upper side.
Go west and hop in the gondola.
Cast the "Fireball" Psynergy to
make it move. Open the chest
with [MINT]. Slide down and head
west, then keep going east to
the next area. Push the log
north, then jump over the river
and push the northeast log west.
Jump over the river again and
push the next two logs south.
Push the northeast log east and
finally push the west log east,
too. Climb down the tree, jump
east to the other side (the log
that just landed here should
help). Use "Whirlwind" on the
petals and jump to the chest
with [THEMIS' AXE]. Go back a
little (to the sign) amd head
east along the curving path to
the next area.

'-------------------------------

After the little scene, cast
"Whirlwind" on the petal to
rescue the kid. After the
conversation, head north a bit
to meet Carver. After the scene,
go south and jump over the gap
near the exit. Climb the ladder
down, use "Growth" on the vine
and you'll find a [MERCURY
DJINNI "CHILL"] here. We can now
get one more Djinni (the one we
saw at the Goma Highlands Road),
so let's do that. Go behind the
northwest house, and get as
close as you can to the yellow
pillar. Use "Move" on it to move
it east twice. Jump on it and
head left, back to the
Highlands. Go north to find a
[HERB] in the pot. Then proceed
south to the gondola and launch
it with "Fireball". On the other
side, run north and east to find
[JUPITER DJINNI "GUST"]. Defeat
it to make it join you. Return
to Carver's Camp. First off, go
into the building where the shop
and inn are located. You'll find
a [SLEEP BOMB] downstairs. Exit
the hut and push the log that is
nearby to the left. Go behind
the southwest house to find some
coins in the pot. Use the
chimney to get into the this
house. Inspect the pot to find
[LUCKY PEPPER]. You can also
find a [HERB] in one of the
barrels of the northwest house.

When you're done here, exit the
town to the south. From Carver's
Place, start going south and
you'll run into a battle with a
[MARS DJINNI "FEVER"]. Go back a
bit, and enter Carver's
Lumberyard, which is west of
Carver's Place.

Go up the stairs, and run north.
Descend the other stairs, and
head to the tree. Cast
"Whirlwind" on the petals and
get over to the upper level. Run
east and push the light-brown
log east to uncover some more
petals. "Whirlwind" them, and
use them to get inside the cave.
Inside, you'll learn the [ZAGAN
SUMMON] after reading the
tablet. Now you can jump onto
that gondola you've passed and
ride it to the next screen. Cast
"Whirlwind" on the petals to
uncover a [NUT] item. Push the
pillar down twice to make a
shortcut. Get on the gondola and
ride it back. Exit the
Lumberyard and head south until
you enter the Konpa Gate.

Approach the gate and ring the
bell. Since you have the Gate
Card, the old guy will open the
gate for you. If not, go back to
the Psynergy Training Grounds
and get it. You can use the
shortcut in Carver's Lumberyard
that we just made. Go north, up
the ladder and jump down on the
west tree. The Djinni will see
you and hide in the flowers. Use
"whirlwind" to uncover it.
[VENUS DJINNI "FLOWER"] is yours
now. Enter the gatekeeper's hut
and check the pots for an
[ANTIDOTE]. After doing all
that, leave the Gate via north
exit.

On the overworld map, follow the
curvy path to the Konpa Ruins.

'-------------------------------

This is the first major dungeon
in the game. It's pretty long,
and its layout and puzzles
should give you the general idea
of what awaits you further in
the game. Anyway, head up the
stairs and enter the temple.
Head directly north in the
central door. Push the block two
times north and go back. Run up
the east stairway and take the
far east door. Proceed east,
jump over the gap and enter the
east room. Use "Move" on the
yellow orb to push it south.
Return to the previous area and
step on the yellow panel. Ignore
this path for now, and exit
west. Take the other east door,
run through the back of it and
stand on the yellow panel.
You'll see a stairway appear.
Proceed to this stairway and
take the west door. In the room
where the purple orb is located,
cast "Whirlwind" on it. Use
"Whirlwind" again on the blue
panels to make them fly in the
air. Jump to the other side of
the room. Take the northwest
exit. In the next area, whirl
the southwest trio of panels and
jump on the eminence. Push the
pillar down. Slide down and this
time whirl the southwest and
northwest trios of panels. Use
them to get to the chest with
[ELVEN SHIRT]. Push the pillar
south east. Whirl all the panels
in the south and get to the east
eminence. Push down another
pillar. Now, slide down and push
both pillars north so you can
jump on them. Whirl the
northeast couple of panels, and
quickly use them (as well as the
pillars) to get to the northeast
exit. Step on the platform and
you'll go up. Exit in the east.
You will be in the main hall of
the temple again. Take the next
door right away. Push the block
down and go back. Take the
platform again to get down.
Enter the central door again.
Push the block east three times
and retreat to the previous
area. Take the east platform
this time. Push the block down,
and return to the room where it
landed. You should have
memorized it by now. Push the
block north once, and west three
times. Return to the main hall
and take the far east door
again. Go east and take the
north exit (the one that we
ignored earlier). Use "Move" on
the statues to put them on the
panels. Use the Psynergy stone
if you need to, and take the
north exit. Follow the path
southwest. Step on both yellow
panels and push the last block
down. Use either of the
shortcuts you just created to
return to the room with the
flower. Push the last block
south two times to trigger a
scene. In the main hall, climb
on the statue's hands. Answer
"Yes" when prompted. You'll
obtain the [GLYPH BOOK]. Go back
to the lower central room where
the flower is and approach the
tablet for a scene. The
southwest statue should be moved
east and the southeast one
should be moved north. The
northeast statue should be moved
west, while the northwest statue
should be moved south. Step on
the sparkling flower to be
transported to the upper floors.
Take the southwest exit. Follow
the path outside, go up the
stairs and stand on the yellow
panel. Enter the door. Grab the
[GRIP CRYSTAL] from the chest.
Equip it on Matthew, and use
your new "Grip" Psynergy to get
to the east side of the room by
grabbing the golden pole. Use
"Grip" to grab the [STONE KEY]
in the northeast. Use the key to
open the door. Get on the
eminence in the center and use
"Grip" to move west. A Djinni
will see you and start running
away from you. Trap it by luring
it to either of the poles and
casting "Grip" to jump at it.
Djinni will get mad and fight
you. Defeat it and [JUPITER
DJINNI "JOLT"] is yours. Now
move to the east end of this
area using "Grip" and exit east.
On the next screen, immediately
turn west to return to previous
area, this time on the lower
level. Go all the way west, and
descend the vine. Keep going
west to find a chest with [PSY
CRYSTAL]. Climb the vine back up
and enter the nearby door.
Follow the path northeast. Enter
the door in front of you and
proceed through the curvy path
to the room with the red orb.
Use "Grip" to get around here
and use "Fireball" on the orb.
Go two screens back and destroy
the big block with "Fireball".
Return to the flower platform
and get down to the main hall.
Use "Fireball" on the red tablet
in the center and descend the
newly- opened stairway. Step on
the yellow block and enter Konpa
Cave.

'-------------------------------
          '---------------------

Use the Psynergy stone if you
need to and exit this area in
the northwest. Follow the path
north, use "Grip" to get to the
opposite side, go down a bit and
cast "Grip" again to get on the
eminence, and push the pillar
down. Slide down and move it to
the left once. Use these
elevations to get to a chest
with [ELVEN RAPIER]. Slide down
and go north. Save at the end of
this path. Once you go through
this door and fight a boss in
the next area, you'll have the
last chance ot return to the
previously visited locations.
This is the first point of no
return in the game. Make sure
you got all the Djinnies up to
this point. If you've been
following this walkthrough, you
should have 7 of them. Also,
this is your last chance to get
the "Zagan" summon. When you're
ready, save your game, head
through the door and watch the
scene.

| BOSS: Stealthy Scout x3 |

| Experience: 798               
| Gold: 426                     
| Item Drop: Psy Grenade        
|-------------------------------
| This boss can be difficult, if
you're underleveled. You should
be level 10,| | at least. Since
there are three of these guys
here, you should cast spells | |
that hit multiple targets.
Karis' Plasma is especially
useful here. If you | | are
unlucky, Scouts can start using
Psy Grenades at the start of the
fight | | to deplete your PP to
zero. Don't bother replenishing
it, as most likely | | they'll
reduce it again. That's why you
need to have a good amount of
Herbs| | or Nuts to help you
heal. Other than that, Scouts
can use Paralysis Shot, | | a
weak attack that can paralyze
your characters, or Stifle Shot
to damage | | you and reduce
your agility. When their HP is
low, they start throwing | |
Herbs at each other, so you
should be using your Djinni here
if you're | | feeling that
regular attacks won't do. |
'-------------------------------

After the long (and interesting)
scene, go east. On the next
screen push the first pole
south, then do the same with the
next one you come to. Push the
east pole left, then the south
pole up, and the west pole
right. Make your way to the
south exit. I do believe this is
the actual point of no return,
cause after you come outside,
you won't be able to get back
into the cave. Anyway, after the
scene, proceed south and watch
the conversation with Rief. He
will then join your party!
Finally, a Mercury Adept. Go
northeast and climb the tree.
Use "Growth" on the vine and
climb it. Move to the west side
and enter the cave to find a
chest with a [COOKIE] inside.
Leave Konpa Cave for good.

In the overworld map, head south
and east to the town of Harapa.

there. Approach the kids near
the southeast house for a little
scene. Go to the fortune-
teller's tent and talk to Nhamu
to a rather creepy comment about
your future. Enter the healer's
house and go upstairs. Check the
pot for [OIL DROP]. Go outside,
and north. Cast "Douse" on the
flame. Jump over it and go
north. In the ruins area, head
north and you'll find [MARS

"Move" on the pillar topush it
east. Go up, and slide down.
Open the chest with [LEATHER
BOOTS]. Cast "Growth" on the

Use it to jump east and into the
cave. On 2F, go north into the
next door. Stand to the left of
the pillar and push it east. Go
east, push the green zol stone
into the hole and exit
northeast. On 3F, go west and
cast "Whirlwind' on the zol
stone. Use it to get to the
southwest exit. Cross the
bridge, and in the next room
push the zol stone east, go up,
avoiding the wind gusts. Slide
down to the right and push the
stone down, then push it east.
Get over to the eminence in the
east and jump over the stone to
a chest with the [BLOW MACE].
Exit northeast. Go north, slide
down. Be careful with the gusts
of wind when heading west to
examine the Djinni. Defeat it to
obtain [VENUS DJINNI "BARK"].
Take the right north stairs and
you'll be outside again. Climb
the ladder to the top. Ignore
the east path for now. Go north
to the town of Passaj.

Follow Rief to the platform for
a scene. After it, go back to
town. Enter the central round
building for another scene. Move
the east grey pillar to the
right, then push the east zol
stone up, left and up. Go to the
left part of the room. Push the
left zol stone right and up.
Then push the remaining stone
left, up, right, up. Throw
"Fireball" at the symbol in the
center to trigger a scene. After
it, enter the hut in northwest
for another scene. Talk to
Baghi, and he'll give you the
[TREE FLUTE]. Leave the hut and
enter the weapon/armor shop.
Push the northeast block west
two times, and south two times.
Push the northwest block east
once and south four times. Push
the remaining block west twice,
north twice and west twice.
Check the pot on the right for a
[SMOKE BOMB]. Exit the house and
go to the inn. Search the pots
for a [NUT]. Take the north
door, go west, check the barrel
foe a [HERB], and enter the
northwest room. You'll find
[POWER BREAD] in a barrel here.
Go back to the fork and take the
north door. Search the pots for
some coins. Go bakc to the fork
and exit southwest. Inspect the
big pot to find [ANTIDOTE]. Go
to the healer's house (lower
west house) and take the back
door. Push the zol stone east,
south, east, west. In the next
room you'll find some [QUALITY
ZOL] in the chest. We can't get
to the Djinni now, so go to the
lower door on the east side of
town and step on the elevator.
You'll be brought to the foot of
the mountain.

In the overworld, run east, and
you'll run into a Djinni battle
in the woods west of Kaocho.
Defeat your opponent to get
[JUPITER DJINNI "ETHER"]. Run
across the bridges and enter
Kaocho in the north.

Go east across the bridge and
then south. Jump over the leaf
to the chest with [SANAN DRESS].
Go to the house east of here and
search the pot for [ELIXIR]. Go
back west across the bridge and
enter the house with lots of
bookshelves. Search the pot for
some coins. Go northwest from
the closed tea shop and check
the pot for a [SMOKE BOMB].
Enter the west house here and
check the drawer for some coins.
Talk to the old woman near the
table to get [GRANDMOTHER'S
GIFT]. Go east from the inn, on
the narrow path beside the
water. Keep going N, jump on the
leaves. Jump on the side of the
palace and use "Grip" on the
pole to get to the opposite
side. Proceed south from there
to find a new [VENUS DJINNI
"STEEL"]. Don't worry about the
Mars one for now, as we can't
get to it. Once you're done
shopping and sightseeing, enter
the big palace in the north.
Answer "Yes" when prompted.
Enter the north red door for a
scene. You'll get [WO'S LETTER]
in the process. After the scene
ends, you'll be in some secluded
section of the Ouroboros
dungeon. Go north two screens to
the next area. Move the snake
statue left and go west. Use
"Move" on the statue, which is
second from the left to get back
in the Kaocho cave. Climb the
vine and exit the cave to the
southeast. Now leave Kaocho and
head for Ayutay, which is to the
south west of here.

Show Wo's Letter to the couple
of Kaocho soldiers here, and
they'll let you through. Go west
and take the [HERB] from the
barrel. You'll find [ANTIDOTE]
in the pot on the east side of
the lake. Now go behind those
soldiers near the entrance and
get on the raft. You need to use
"Whirlwind" to move it. The raft
goes in the opposite direction
from where you directed
"Whirlwind". Stand on the raft
facing west and cast
"Whirlwind". The raft will move
east. Do the same to move it
north and west. Jump west and
north to get on another raft. Go
north and west to get to a chest
with a [COOKIE]. Ge back on the
raft and sail east, south, east,
north. Head north into the
palace and use the letter to get
through the guards. Show the
letter again, this time to
Kaocho general Ku-Tsung, for a
scene. Exit this area in
southeast. Use "Growth" on the
vine and go west to the door. In
the next screen, take the
northeast exit. Follow the path
to the area with the tree. You
can get some coins by searching
the pot in the left wing. Use
the Tree Flute near the tree for
a scene. Keep going north after
Amiti, grabbing some coins from
the pot on your way. Head
straight to Paithos' throne.
After the long scene, go south
twice, then take the east exit.
Search the drawer for [OPEN
HELM]. Go south and take the
stairway east. Check the barrel
for [ELIXIR] and go back. Head
south and take the southeast
exit outside. Check the pots for
some coins. Back in the previous
area, go west and take the
southwest exit. Check the middle
pot for [SLEEP BOMB]. Go back
and take any of the two
stairways leading to the lower
part of Ayutay castle. Let's
call this big area "the fountain
area". Go to the center room
behind the fountain for a scene.
Take the northeast exit. Heal
yourself and save the game.
Examine the tablet and play the
Tree Flute.

| Sand Prince is easy. His
variety of attack is pretty
poor. He mostly uses | | regular
attacks or Eartquake. Arc Blast
can hit a couple of characters.
The| | only attack that can deal
a good amount of damage to you
is Eruption, but | | I've only
seen him use it once or twice.
Rief's Water Psynergy works best
| | against the Sand Prince, so
keep that in mind and heal when
needed. |
'-------------------------------

You'll obtain the [SAND PRINCE]
stone. Equip it on Tyrell. Go
back to the previous room and
use your new "Arid Heat"
Psynergy on the water bowl for a
scene. Return to the fountain
area and go near the southwest
exit. Turn north and enter the
door there. Open the chest with
[POWER BREAD]. Go back and take
the northwest exit. Go northwest
and make your way through the
crates to a chest with a [VIAL].
Return to the fountain area.
Exit it southeast and follow the
path to a room that has a chest
with [CRYSTAL POWDER]. Return to
the fountain area. Exit it
southwest and take the west
door. Move the pillar into the
darkened space and go back. Go
east and into the little room.
Inside you will find a chest
with coins. Go back and exit
south. Step on the raft and sail
it west to the chest with
[LEATHER BOOTS]. After that,
sail the raft east south and
east. Jump south and push the
pillar into the water. Go back
and get on the east raft this
time. Sail it south, west, south
to get to an island that has a
chest with [GLITTERING TIARA].
Sail the raft west, north, west,
north, east. Jump east, climb
the ladder and exit north. Sail
the raft west to find [JUPITER
DJINNI "BREATH"]. Back on the
raft, sail it east, north, east,
north to a chest with [WATER OF
LIFE]. Go back to the lake area
and sail the raft west, south
and west. Jump to the tower in
the center of the lake.

Drain the bowl with "Arid
Heat"and go north twice. Jump to
the west exit. Continue on,
don't touch the chest and take
the southeast exit. Cast "Arid
Heat" on the bowl and climb
down. Jump to the northwest
exit. Open the chest and read
the letter. Go southeast, move
the block east and exit this
room. Cast "Arid Heat" on
another bowl, climb down and
take the north door. Head north
and go through the west
waterfall. Open the chest with a
[KIMONO]. Go back and enter the
east waterfall. Jump to the
bowl, drain it and climb down.
Push the blocks in one vertical
line to make path to the north
door. Cast "Douse" on the bowl
and go north. Head east, west
and north. Go down the stair way
and cast "Arid Heat" on the
bowl. Then get back up and stand
close to the Djinni. Cast
"Fireball" on it to make it jump
down. Defeat it and you'll get
[MERCURY DJINNI "SURGE"]. Go
into the north door. You'll see
water scales. Move to the right
bowl and fill it with water by
casting "Douse". Take the nearby
stairs and cast "Growth" on the
vine. Move a bit west and run on
the scales to get higher. Push
the red block down. Enter the
northeast door. Go north and
fill the bowl with water. Head
southwest and push the pipe
north. Push the second pipe
west. Go back around the room
and push the third pipe west.
Return to the previous room and
use "Arid Heat" on the right
bowl. Cast "Douse" on the left
bowl. Go back up and jump into
the stream of water (near the
elephant head). After the scene,
cast "Whirlwind" on the wind-
vane. Use Matthew's "Retreat" to
get out of here. Dry the bowl
again. Go north twice and take
the path east. Follow it to the
room with three chests. Jump
east and open the east chest for
[STORM BRAND]. Now you can leave
this place for good.

Back in Ayutay, go back to the
castle to meet Paithos. From the
Alchemy Well, go west and take
west door. Sail the raft west
and open the chest with [DRAGON
SHIELD]. Push the pillar in the
water and go back to the
fountain area. Take whichever of
north exits and take the central
south door. Climb up the ladder
for a scene. Amiti will join
your party. Save your game and
go south. Try to walk out of the
castle and the generals will
stop you.

|-------------------------------
| The general can pack a punch
if you're not being careful. Ku-

while Ku-Embra boosts their
attack. While Ku-Tsung is the |
| less dangerous of the two, he
should be taken down first,
cause he likes | | himself and
Ku-Embra, when they're low on
HP. Ku-Embra can also heal, but
| | he does it much less often.
Ku-Embra is the powerhouse, and
he uses various| | attacks like
Zealous Fury and Cyclone Slash.
Heal immediately after one of |
| these. Now would be a good
time to try out a couple of
summons since you | | already
should have a nice amount of
Djinni to bring out the damaging
ones.| | This isn't a hard
battle if you're prepared well.
|
'-------------------------------

After the scene, leave Ayutay.
Upon your return to Kaocho,
you'll see a scene. Go west
across the bridge and use

'-------------------------------

Use the stairs to go down and
exit south. Don't use the south
exit in the next room, as it
leads to Kaocho palace. Take the
northeast exit instead. Run down
the stairway and go south. Climb
down the ladder and cast
"Whirlwind" on the zol stone.
Use it to go north at the fork
and use "Move" on the far east
snake statue. Jump to the chest
with [IXION MAIL]. Go back and
slide down. Go to the next room
and examine the tablet. Cast
"Fireball" on snake's tongue and
head further. Run around the
hole and exit southwest. The
chest here is a Mimic, so you
can ignore it. Or fight it, if
you want a decent amount of EXP
points. Throw "Fireball" at
snake's tongue and climb down.
"Whirlwind" both stones on your
way to get to a chest with
[VULCAN AXE]. Slide down and
enter the north door. Whirl the
zol stone and climb the ladder.

Go south and move the statue
that is near the Djinni to the

zol stone, push it east and cast
"Whirlwind" on it. Make your way
to the Djinni and defeat it.
[JUPITER DJINNI "VORTEX"] is
yours now. You can now exit the
room to the north. Follow the
path to a non-working elevator,
jump over it and exit southeast.
Examine the tablet and cast
"Whirlwind" on the giant wind-
vane. Go back to the previous
room and jump on the elevator.
Back in B1, run up the newly
formed stairway and enter the
door. Grab the [SOL MASK] from
the chest. You can escape the
dungeon now.

Back in Passaj, go to the
Alchemy Forge and put the Sol
Mask in its place. After the
scene, exit the Forge and enter
the equipment shop. It should be
working now. You'll obtain a
[ZOL RING]. Now enter the
northwest building, and open the
treasury. Check the pot to find
a [VIAL]. Open the chests for
[HARD NUT] and [PROPHET'S HAT].
Exit the building and run up the
stairway to the wall of Passaj.
Head south and run across the
entrance arc, to the next area.
Slide down and walk to the east
side to find [MARS DJINNI
"BRAND"] here. Cast "Growth" on
the vine and climb it to get
back into Passaj. This time go
to the Cloud Platform for a
scene. Leave Passaj and return
to Harapa. In Harapa, take the
north exit, and jump over blocks
and logs to get to the Harapa
Ruins.

Go down the stairs and step on
the green platform. Exit the
room to the south east. Use
"Growth" on both vines here, and
go back. Take the southwest exit
now and proceed south along the
water line. In the icy area, go
south and make a turn to the
nearby door leading north. Step
on the panel and proceed south.
Run east along the ledge to open
two chests with [LUCKY PEPPER]
and [BONE ARMLET]. Go back a bit
and slide east. Take the
southeast stairway. You'll find
two chests in this room that
contain [CRYSTAL POWDER] and
[VIKING HELM]. Open them and
return upstairs. Take the nearby
door and push the statue onto
the ice. Slide north and west to
the next area. Now slide north,
east, south, west, north, west,
south, east, south to land near
the Djinni. Defeat it and you'll

|-------------------------------
| Ice Queen can be tough if
you're underleveled. I recommend
getting Matthew | | to at least
level 19 so he can learn Revive.
If things get really bad, you |
| will need this spell.
Although, at level 20, she
doesn't seem too tough if | |
you heal in time. Her weakness
is obviously fire, so spells
like Tyrell's | | Nova will deal
the most damage to her. Coupled
with summons like Inferno | |
she won't stand a chance against
you. Her most dangerous attacks
are Ice | | Missile and
Frostbite, since they deal lots
of damage to multiple party | |
members. Karis'/Rief's healing
spells should be applied
immediately. When | | Ice Queen
uses Ply Well, it's a sign she's
gonna die soon, so focus all of
| | attacks on bringing her down
and you'll emerge victorious. |
'-------------------------------

You'll get [ICE QUEEN] gemstone.
Equip it on Rief. Freeze the
with the new "Cold Snap"
Psynergy and slide south, then
east. Walk through the nearby
door, step on the panel and go
back. Take the northeast exit.
Step on the panel. Climb the
vine and jump over the puddle.
Cast "Cold Snap" on the puddle
and jump west to a northwest
chest that contains [MYSTERY
BLADE]. Slide down twice and go
north. Leave Harapa Ruins. Back
in Harapa, attempt to leave the
town via southeast exit for a
small scene. Rest at the inn and
go west, behind the southwest
house. Cast "Cold Snap" on the
puddle and approach the
southeast exit. Hug the outside
wall and cast "Growth" on the
vine. Climb it, and run west to
the house. Check the pot for
[CRYSTAL POWDER]. Enter the
house to find [VENUS DJINNI
"BRICK"] inside. Now you can
safely leave Harapa.

Back in Passaj, enter the
Alchemy Forge and cast "Cold
Snap" on both puddles for a
scene. After it, go northwest to
the Cloud Platform. Before
advancing, make sure you have 22
Djinni.

another vine and read the
tablet. Go down the vine and
move the angel statue nearby.
Head through the door. Go up the
stairs and cast "Whirl wind" on
the wind-vane. Go back and down.
Grab the pole on the circle with
"Grip", and step on the circle
after that. You'll be
transported to a big room with
many doors. Each of these doors
represents a Zodiac sign, and
contains a puzzle. You have to
solve all the puzzles here.
Let's start with the Leo door.
Cast "Fireball" at the lion's
head and go back. Next up,
Aquarius door. Stand west from
the mechanism and cast "Grip" on
it. Head north and "Fireball"
the lion's head. Go back turn
the mechanism again and proceed
to the chest that contains
[SPIKED ARMOR]. In the north
room, cast "Douse" on the jar
and go back to the main hall. Go
through the Gemini door. The
puzzle here is a bit tricky. You
can move any statue you won't,
but I'll give the example by
moving the west statue. Push it
west, north twice, west twice,
south, west twice, north twice,
east, north twice, east twice,
south, east twice, north three
times and east. Go back and take
the Virgo door. Stand to the
left of the mechanism and cast
"Grip" on it. Simply turn the
statue around with "Grip" and
cast "Growth". Return to the
main area and enter the Libra
door. Jump on the scales, and go
north into the door. You'll need
"Move" for this puzzle. Jump on
the east scale and move one
statue on it. Then jump on the
west scale and move on statue on
it. Do the same with the east
scale, and with the west one
again. Go back to the main hall
and head through the Capricorn
door. Shoot the only ram plate
with "Fireball". Then shoot the
left one, and then left one
again. Finally, shoot the middle
plate to solve the puzzle. Back
in the main area, Pisces door is
next. Go east and jump to the
mechanism. Use "Grip" on it and
walk to the north room. Cast
"Douse" on both fish statues and
go back. Enter the Cancer door.
Go northeast and turn the statue
around with "Grip". Open the
chest for [GRIEVOUS MACE]. Jump
west and turn the mechanism to
get to the north door. Dry the
bowl with "Arid Heat" and go
back. Take the Scorpio door.
Cast "Grip" on the mechanism and
run around the room to get to
the north door. Push the
northeast zol stone west, and
then push the Scorpio zol stone
north. Push the northwest zol
stone south, east and north.
Push the new north west zol
stone east and south. Finally,
make the Scorpio zol stone go
east. Go back and enter the
Taurus door. Stand to the left
of the north mechanism and turn
it using "Grip". Shoot the
lion's head to release the
Djinni. Turn the second
mechanism and defeat the little
critter to obtain [JUPITER
DJINNI "DOLDRUM"]. Enter the
north door. Cast "Douse" on the
bull's head and freeze the
puddles with "Cold Snap". Go
back and through the Aries door.
The chest behind the statue is a
mimic. Defeat it to get a Lure
Cap, which you might need. In
the puzzle room, push the square
statue south twice, west seven
times and north twice. Push the
circle statue north twice, east
seven times, south twice. Now
move the triangle statue all the
way south between the trails of
previous two statues. Go back to
the main area and enter the
Sagittarius room. Pull the
mechanism with "Grip" and go
into the north door. Freeze the
puddle with "Cold Snap" and use
"Grip" on the pole while
standing to the left of the
statue. Return to the main area.
Step on the platform in the
middle to go back up. Cast
"Grip" on the broken mirror to
launch a pendulum. Head west to
the overworld.

Head west over the bridge and
north into the cave. In the
North Wall Shrine, melt the ice
pillars with "Fireball". Open
the chest with a [VIAL] and go
east then. Melt one of the ice
pillars in the back row and make
your way west. Freeze the puddle
with "Cold Snap". Go back to the
center of the shrine and slide
north. Examine the tablet to
learn the [MOLOCH SUMMON]. Exit
the cave, and return to the fork
near Craggy Peak Ruins. Go
northeast to the village of Te
Rya.

Exit the hut and go over to the
Djinni. Blast it with "Fireball"
and it'll jump into the water
and the guy will catch it. Go to
the pier and you will get
[MERCURY DJINNI "DEWDROP"]. Go

| Sludge is pretty easy, once

immediately, as they tend to
buff and | | heal Sludge. They
don't have much HP, anyway.
Sludge can do Tail Slap and | |
Crush which are not too
damaging, and call more skulls
to the battle. When | | it heals
itself up to 300 HP, it's a sign
that the creature is close to |

skills to defeat it. |

| Mountain Roc is certainly more
difficult than the previous
boss, as he is | | much
stronger. His most common
attacks include regular physical
attack, | | Tempest which deals
around 170 HP damage to everyone
in your party, and | | Upward
Blasr which he uses to damage
one character for about 160-180
HP. | | He also uses Shriek to
lower your attack, Fire Breath,
although its damage | | is
minimal and Seismic Stomp for
about 170 HP damage to 2 or 3
characters. | | Karis' Shine
Plasma and the likes work best
in this battle. Remember to | |
heal when necessary and you'll
be fine. |
'-------------------------------

After the battle, pick up the
[MAGMA SHARD] and enter the
bird's mouth. Pick up four more
shards and go north for a scene.
Use north exit to get out of the
bird's body. Go south and cast
"Crush" on the mountain edge.
Slide down and defeat the Djinni
here. It's [JUPITER DJINNI
"PUFF"]. Now you can cast the
"Retreat" spell to get out of
here.

Before returning to Belinsk, go
to the Kolima Village and buy a
Dream Leaf in the item shop. Go
to the Border Town and sleep at
the inn. At night, exit the inn
and go to the west part of town.
Go north and into the cave.
Examine the tablet to learn the
[HAURES SUMMON]. Wake up from
the dream and leave Border Town.
Head back to Teppe Ruins.
Approach the boulder near the
exit and cast "Crush" on it. Go
into the room and open the chest
with [MYTHRIL SILVER].

Before going to Belinsk Ruins,
make sure you've gotten the
Moloch, Ulysses and Haures
summons and that you have 38
Djinni. The second point of no
return is coming up after you
clear the Belinsk Ruins. Back in
Belinsk, go to the band and talk

jump on the gear again. Jump off
at the east end and go into the
door. Walk over the gears and in
the next room, make your way to
the south exit. Push the object
into the pit and jump west to a
chest containing [MIST POTION].
Head into the upper room. Push
the zol stone east, then west.
Use it to get to a chest that
has [QUALITY ZOL] in it. Push
the zol stone east again, then
south, west, north, east, north.
Cast "Whirlwind" on it and climb
up to the northeast door. Cast
"Whirlwind" on the orb and slide
down. Exit south, and go west to
jump on the moving plate. Jump
off in the west, and go down the
stairs. Push the object into the
pit and jump east to a chest
with some coins. Go back up the
stairs and into the door. Up the
stairs again, east and into the
room. You'll need to use "Crush"
in here. Here's how to get to a
chest with [HAGBONE MACE]:

 x  x  O  x
    x  O  O  O       ("x" marks 
    O  O  x  x        "O" marks

| Item Drop: Spark Shuriken,
Illusion Perfume |
|-------------------------------
| I hope you were waiting for
this battle as much as I were.
Unfortunately, | | Blados and
Chalis are all talk and no
action. At level 30, you'll have
no | | trouble disposing of
them. Beware of Chalis' Psy
Grenade, as she sucks the | | PP
out of your characters and
Scornful Caress that does some
high damage if| | you are
underleveled. Both enemies can
cast Shadow Shield to buff their
| | defenses, but it wears off
after a while. Blados likes to
use Firecracker | | frequently
which should be followed by
Karis' Healthy Wind/ Rief's Wish
| | Well. He can also throw some
Spark Shurikens at you to
paralyze your party | | members,
but other than that, he's weak.
Anyway, it shouldn't take too
long|
| to bring them both down.      
'-------------------------------

After the scene, go up the
stairs, west and cast
"Whirlwind" on the zol stone. Go
up the ladder and stairs to push

and then "Cold Snap" on the
puddle. Climb the ladders and
pick up [MERCURY DJINNI
"PINCER"]. Go up the ladder and
slide down the roof. Take the
north exit out of town.

| BOSS: Tangle Bloom            
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 145               
| Gold: 77                      
| Item Drop: Psy Crystal        
|-------------------------------
| If you're level 5 like me, you
should have no real problems
with this | | battle, since
Isaac and Garet are helping you
out. This makes the fight | |
pathetically easy. Tangle Bloom
mostly does physical attacks,
and rarely | | uses the Bramble
Seed attack, and even more
rarely - Phantom Spore, which |
| can cause delusion on your
characters. Regular attacks are
fine for this | | battle, since
Garet and Isaac will be doing
the Djinn-summoning job here. |
| This is more of a training
boss battle, I guess. |
'-------------------------------

.-------------------------------
| BOSS: Dim Dragon              
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 179               
| Gold: 60                      
| Item Drop: Nut                
|-------------------------------
| I guess that GS: The Lost Age
players are familiar with who
this guy tries | | to resemble.
Anyway, it's a pretty easy boss,
since it uses primarily weak | |
attacks like Sizzle Breath or
Pebble Breath. They hit more
than one party | | member, but
the damage is minimal. It can
also use Scary Jinx spell, that
| | inflicts Curse on one
character, but I guess you
should be able to kill it | |
before the spell works. If
you're having trouble with this
Dragon, consider| | gaining a
couple of level, but I guess
level 6-7 should do the job. |
'-------------------------------

.-------------------------------
| BOSS: Stealthy Scout x3 |
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 798               
| Gold: 426                     
| Item Drop: Psy Grenade        
|-------------------------------
| This boss can be difficult, if
you're underleveled. You should
be level 10,| | at least. Since
there are three of these guys
here, you should cast spells | |
that hit multiple targets.
Karis' Plasma is especially
useful here. If you | | are
unlucky, Scouts can start using
Psy Grenades at the start of the
fight | | to deplete your PP to
zero. Don't bother replenishing
it, as most likely | | they'll
reduce it again. That's why you
need to have a good amount of
Herbs| | or Nuts to help you
heal. Other than that, Scouts
can use Paralysis Shot, | | a
weak attack that can paralyze
your characters, or Stifle Shot
to damage | | you and reduce
your agility. When their HP is
low, they start throwing | |
Herbs at each other, so you
should be using your Djinni here
if you're | | feeling that
regular attacks won't do. |

| BOSS: Sand Prince             
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 1540              
| Gold: 825                     
| Item Drop: N/A                
|-------------------------------
| Sand Prince is easy. His
variety of attack is pretty
poor. He mostly uses | | regular
attacks or Eartquake. Arc Blast
can hit a couple of characters.
The| | only attack that can deal
a good amount of damage to you
is Eruption, but | | I've only
seen him use it once or twice.
Rief's Water Psynergy works best
| | against the Sand Prince, so
keep that in mind and heal when
needed. |

| BOSS: Ku-Tsung & Ku-Embra |
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 1647              
| Gold: 762                     
| Item Drop: Plume Dumpling,
Rice Ration |
|-------------------------------
| The general can pack a punch
if you're not being careful. Ku-
Tsung boosts | | their defense,
while Ku-Embra boosts their
attack. While Ku-Tsung is the |
| less dangerous of the two, he
should be taken down first,
cause he likes | | himself and
Ku-Embra, when they're low on
HP. Ku-Embra can also heal, but
| | he does it much less often.
Ku-Embra is the powerhouse, and
he uses various| | attacks like
Zealous Fury and Cyclone Slash.
Heal immediately after one of |
| these. Now would be a good
time to try out a couple of
summons since you | | already
should have a nice amount of
Djinni to bring out the damaging
ones.| | This isn't a hard
battle if you're prepared well.

| BOSS: Ice Queen               
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 2402              
| Gold: 1236                    
| Item Drop: N/A                
|-------------------------------
| Ice Queen can be tough if
you're underleveled. I recommend
getting Matthew | | to at least
level 19 so he can learn Revive.
If things get really bad, you |
| will need this spell.
Although, at level 20, she
doesn't seem too tough if | |
you heal in time. Her weakness
is obviously fire, so spells
like Tyrell's | | Nova will deal
the most damage to her. Coupled
with summons like Inferno | |
she won't stand a chance against
you. Her most dangerous attacks
are Ice | | Missile and
Frostbite, since they deal lots
of damage to multiple party | |
members. Karis'/Rief's healing
spells should be applied
immediately. When | | Ice Queen
uses Ply Well, it's a sign she's
gonna die soon, so focus all of
| | attacks on bringing her down
and you'll emerge victorious. |

| Item Drop: N/A                
|-------------------------------
| Sludge is pretty easy, once
you've taken care of the skulls
it calls to the| | battle. Get
rid of the Shield Skulls
immediately, as they tend to
buff and | | heal Sludge. They
don't have much HP, anyway.
Sludge can do Tail Slap and | |
Crush which are not too
damaging, and call more skulls
to the battle. When | | it heals
itself up to 300 HP, it's a sign
that the creature is close to |
| dying. Use your most powerful
skills to defeat it. |

| BOSS: Mountain Roc            
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 12852             
| Gold: 140                     
| Item Drop: N/A                
|-------------------------------
| Mountain Roc is certainly more
difficult than the previous
boss, as he is | | much
stronger. His most common
attacks include regular physical
attack, | | Tempest which deals
around 170 HP damage to everyone
in your party, and | | Upward
Blasr which he uses to damage
one character for about 160-180
HP. | | He also uses Shriek to
lower your attack, Fire Breath,
although its damage | | is
minimal and Seismic Stomp for
about 170 HP damage to 2 or 3
characters. | | Karis' Shine
Plasma and the likes work best
in this battle. Remember to | |
heal when necessary and you'll
be fine. |

| BOSS: Blados & Chalis         
|-------------------------------
| Experience: 15702             
| Gold: 2880                    
| Item Drop: Spark Shuriken,
Illusion Perfume |
|-------------------------------
| I hope you were waiting for
this battle as much as I were.
Unfortunately, | | Blados and
Chalis are all talk and no
action. At level 30, you'll have
no | | trouble disposing of
them. Beware of Chalis' Psy
Grenade, as she sucks the | | PP
out of your characters and
Scornful Caress that does some
high damage if| | you are
underleveled. Both enemies can
cast Shadow Shield to buff their
| | defenses, but it wears off
after a while. Blados likes to
use Firecracker | | frequently
which should be followed by
Karis' Healthy Wind/ Rief's Wish
| | Well. He can also throw some
Spark Shurikens at you to
paralyze your party | | members,
but other than that, he's weak.
Anyway, it shouldn't take too
long|
| to bring them both down.
