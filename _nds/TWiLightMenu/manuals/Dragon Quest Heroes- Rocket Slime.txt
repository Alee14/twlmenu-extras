 3] THE BASICS                  
________________________________

+----------------+
| Transportation |
+----------------+--------------

Sometimes if you're stuck in a
dungeon and you need to return
back to town, you won't have to
go to the entrance to head back
to Boingburg. You will find
carts, usually situated on train
tracks or in rivers, which make
their way to town. You can use
the carts for a variety of uses,
since they can carry many
different things.

Carts can carry items, monsters,
slimes, and you (well, you ARE a
slime). Each cart can carry four
items at one time, and the carts
travel through very frequently,
so there's never a time without
one.

They aren't uncommon, and this
may be a simple and unaccurate
generalization, but I'd say you
can find carts around every five
screens or so. You rarely have
to go far without finding a way
to get back to town. They're
very useful and are easy to
find, so make sure to use these
carts to their fullest extent.


+------------------+
| Collecting Stuff |
+------------------+------------

Collecting various items and the
cart system goes hand in hand.
You can pick up many different
things using your Elasto Blast.
But there is always a reason to
collect 'em, right? Collecting
items and monsters are the two
main things to collect. Once you
have the objects on your back,
throw them onto a cart to have
them shipped off to Boingburg.

Monsters can be captured and
brought back to town. If you
collect 30 of one monster
species and talk to it in the
museum, you can use them as crew
members in tank battles (more on
that later). You can also use
items throughout the levels for
your tank. Bring them back to
town and you can use them as
ammunition for the tank as well.
Also, when you rescue a slime,
throw it on a cart to bring it
back to the safety of town.


+--------------+
| Tank Battles |
+--------------+----------------

Tanks battles is where Rocket
Slime truly shines. You will be
introduced to tanks in the
second level, where you're
thrown into a tutorial. The
general idea of tank battles is
quite simple: destroy the
opposing tank. This can be quite
difficult, but I'll explain why
along the way.

It's pretty obvious that you
need to reduce the enemy's tank
down to zero HP. When the battle
begins, the two tanks (yours and
the enemy's) will be shown on
the top screen. The tank
interior is shown on the bottom
screen, and you can move Rocket
around the several rooms. There
are six chutes in all that
deposit weapons into the
interior (two in the top room
with the cannons, two in the
bottom room, and two on the left
room). What you have to do is
collect all of the weapons
around the tank and throw them
into the cannons.

They'll be launched at the
opposing tank, and its direction
depends on what cannon you shot
it out of. Using the top cannon
will launch the weapon upwards
in a parabola (u-shape).
Launching a weapon out of the
bottom cannon will cause it to
go straight towards the target.

While you go around and collect
weapons to use, the enemies will
be doing the same. They will be
shooting weapons in an upwards
angle or straight ahead. Each
time a weapon hits a tank, it
will deal damage to the vehicle.

If two weapons collide in
midair, they will fall to the
ground and be negated. Use this
advice to knock your enemies'
weapons out of the air before
they hit your tank.

A little later in the game, you
will be able to use up to three
crew members. They can perform
different tasks to help Rocket
out in tank battles. On the
other hand, there are monsters
to face in the opposing tank.
Sometimes they will try to
infiltrate your tank. Either
Elasto Blast them to oblivion or
throw them in a cannon and
launch 'em back to where they
came from.

Most tank battles take a pretty
long time. Make sure to use the
two different cannons to avoid
colliding with enemy weapons.
Once a tank reaches zero HP,
it's not done just yet. When a
tank reaches zero HP, their
engine will be exposed (it looks
like a heart on the screen).
Remember, this can happen with
your tank as well as the
enemies.

When the engine is exposed, you
must infiltrate the enemy tank
and destroy the heart. Make your
way into the engine room, which
is almost always to the right of
the entrance. From there, Elasto
Blast your way to the engine and
Elasto Blast into it to win the
battle.

Yeah, it's a lot of work to win
a tank battle. But there are
many ways to win with all of the
different weapons. There are
thirty weapons to use, and most
are items found throughout the
various levels. When you chuck
an item onto a cart to be
brought to be town, it'll most
likely be available in Ducktor
Cid's shop. Make sure to stock
up on ammo by collecting more
and more of each item. You can
hold up to 30 weapons in a tank,
so use the ammo spaces wisely.

After rescuing Slimechanic, you
can talk to him in regards of
your tank's HP. In order to have
him increase the HP of your
tank, you will have to usually
give him some money and a couple
items. You should make sure to
upgrade your tank's HP and ammo
constantly so you won't be
outmatched.


+---------------+
| Saving Slimes |
+---------------+---------------

Saving your fellow slimes is of
course the most important part
of the game. Rocket will find
blue treasure chests branded
with a slime symbol throughout
each level. Elasto Blast into it
to free a slime. From there,
you'll have to bring them back
to town (almost always by
carts). Sometimes chimaera wings
need to be used to bring a slime
back to town.

You will receive a letter from
the slime with a gift inside
almost immediately after they
reach town. Usually it's an item
used for ammo, or it can be a
recipe.

In the town, there are large
iron balls with numbers on them.
The number on the ball
represents the number of slimes
needed to remove it. For
example, if there is an iron
ball with "15St" on it, then
that means you need to have
rescued at least 15 slimes in
order to remove the ball.

Usually, the pesky iron balls
block important areas of the
town, so you will have to rescue
as many slimes as you can in
order to reach new areas of the
city. There are 100 slimes in
all, so make sure to find and
rescue all of 'em!

I think I've covered everything
nicely. Onto the walkthrough!

 4] WALKTHROUGH                 
________________________________

================================
 4.01] PROLOGUE                 
================================

 Slimes: None

The story starts off with Rocket
and his friends chillin' in the
palace garden and playing with a
magical flute found in the
castle. One of Rocket's pals,
Hooly, challenges him to a
little game. He says if Rocket
can clear the garden of all
leaves in 60 seconds, then he
can have the flute. You are
placed in a square room with
patches of leaves on the ground.
You must use Rocket's Elasto
Blast technique to remove all of
the leaves.

To use Elasto Blast, hold down
A. Move in a direction you want
to be shot out by using the
D-Pad. Let go of A to have
Rocket shoot off in the
specified direction. The longer
you hold down A, the farther
Rocket will launch. It's pretty
easy once you get the hold of
it, and the little game is very
easy. I remember completing it
in around nine seconds on my
first try.

Once you win the game, Hooly
will give you the flute to play.
Rocket plays the instrument and
it sounds great. The gang hears
Rocket's dad, Big Daddy, making
his way to their location. They
hide the flute in Rocket's
stomach, stretching him out to
great proportions. Big Daddy
comes in and has a talk with
everyone, then leaves (not
realizing that Rocket is that
big long dude). After, run south
to the heart of Boingburg with
the flute still in your body.

After this, there are massive
explosions in town. The Plob
make their grand entrance and
capture everyone, including
Rocket's friends. Big Daddy
tries to make a stand, but is
defeated and surrenders. All 100
slimes are taken hostage, but
Rocket is still safe. The Plob
mistake him for a worm and throw
him in Forewood Forest, where
the adventure begins...


================================
 4.02] FOREWOOD FOREST          
================================

 Slimes: Swotsy, Stony, Mother G

As Rocket lands in the entrance
of Forewood Forest, the flute
will fall out of his mouth and
break in half. Uh oh! Walk to
the right to find your first
slime-filled chest.

Elasto Blast it open to rescue
one of Rocket's good friends,
Swotsy. Swotsy will ask you to
carry him back to town (almost
all rescued slimes do). Hit
Swotsy with an Elasto Blast to
send him flying in the air, then
move under him to catch him on
your back. FYI, you can hold up
to three objects at a time on
your back.

Walk back to the left and throw
him on the dirt path, and he'll
return to town. Seconds later,
you will receive some mail from
Swotsy. Press start to open the
menu, then press L or R to reach
your mail section. The slime
will thank Rocket and reward you
with a Pompom.

All slimes will give you mail
shortly after being rescued, and
they always come with a gift.
There's a large wing-shaped
portal to the right of where
Swotsy was held. It's closed off
for now, but it will open up and
function as a portal once you
step in the other one. Portals
like these are found in all
levels and are very useful.

Head to the north to meet up
with two Plob members whom are
retreating. While fleeing, they
drop another chest. Open it to
rescue Stony. Instead of
returning to the entrance, you
can throw Stony on the cart to
bring him back to town. Each
cart can hold up to four objects
at a time.

Simply Elasto Blast the cart if
you wish to knock everything
off. You can also hop onto a
cart to return to Boingburg.
Open the mail after saving Stony
to get a Pompom.

Break the jars below the
railroad and proceed to the
right to enter the next area.
Once you enter, a slime from
inside a chest will talk to you.
The chest is located on a ramp,
but you must go around the large
tree trunk in the center of the
area to reach it. Proceed to
walk around the tree trunk. Go
up the stairs to the left and
break open the chest to save
Mother Glooperior.

Mother Glooperior is the town
nun, and she runs the church.
She takes Rocket back to town
and explains the basics (which I
have already told you). She
explains the cart system and
suggests that you use the carts
to bring items and enemies back
to Boingburg. Rocket hits the
hay and goes to sleep.


================================
 4.03] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

Once the sun rises, exit
Rocket's humble abode to meet up
with the three rescued slimes.
They inspect one of the iron
balls blocking the church. It
has "3St" engraved on it, which
means that three slimes are
needed to move the ball. The
three slimes remove the iron
ball and open up the church.

Go inside the church and talk to
Mother Glooperior to save your
game. There really isn't much
else to do in Boingburg, so it's
back to slime savin'! Return to
Forewood Forest after saving.


================================
 4.04] FOREWOOD FOREST          
================================

 Slimes: Baron Blubba, Peewee, B

We're back! There is still much
of the forest to explore, so
lets get going. A small note:
there are enemies present. You
can either defeat them for Gold
or throw them onto carts and
bring 'em to town. Return to the
area where you saved Mother
Glooperior. Take out the
Jailcats (or throw them on the
carts to bring them back to
town). The northeast path is
opened up now, so go through to
the next section.

The right section is blocked by
a stone wall, so walk over to
the northwest to find a blue
rock. This is a Rockbomb; throw
it and it'll explode when it
comes in contact with the
ground. Pick it up carefully and
throw it at the stone wall to
destroy it. Open the slime chest
on the other side to find Baron
Blubba. Bring him back to town.
You cannot reach the suspended
rope, so walk past it to the new
room.

In here, defeat the Mischievous
Moles and use your Elasto Blast
to get rid of the leaves. You
can find Gold underneath. Jump
into the well and climb down the
shovel to the bottom. Once in
the well, open the chest for a
Medicinal Herb, which restores
one heart.

Break the jars and use the
nearby Rockbomb to blast the
stone wall to rubble. Continue
into a large room, where you'll
be attacked by many Mischievous
Moles. These punks burrow
underground and whack you with
their shovels. Use Elasto Blasts
and Rockbombs to dispose of
them.

Next, use a Rockbomb to destroy
the right-hand wall of the room
and climb up the rope to reach
another area. You'll be filled
in another leafy area. A
noticeable spot of the room is
the large pile of leaves in the
southwest section. Elasto Blast
it to reveal another well and
hop down. You'll find a cart
system and some slime chests.

Open the one on the right to
rescue Peewee. Open the one to
the left to save Bubbilly. Throw
them both on the cart to bring
them back to town, and you will
get two Rockbombs from them.
Climb the rope on the left side
of the area to return to where
Mother Glooperior was held. If
you don't want to return to
town, go back up the well on the
other side.

There is a large wing-shaped
portal on the northwest side of
the area. Jump into it to open
the other portal near the
entrance to the forest (I
pointed it out to you earlier in
the walkthrough). Go through the
gate to the north to reach a
hallway leading to the boss's
lair. Step on the bird-shaped
platform to regain all of your
health. Go up to the boss's lair
and prepare for battle.


+--------------------+
| BOSS: Bough Beater |
+--------------------+----------

This boss is incredibly easy.
The menacing tree known as Bough
Beater will run sideways around
the small arena. All you have to
do to attack him is to Elasto
Blast into his body. He is
incredibly slow, but will attack
with his arms once you hit him.
Bough Beater extends his lanky
arms, so run to either side to
avoid his appendages.

Once he loses half of his
health, Bough Beater will move
much faster, in addition to
turning purple. Leaves will fall
to the ground, but I do not see
what the point of it is. Now as
you hit him with an Elasto
Blast, the leaves on his head
will crumble. Hit him with an
Elasto Blast several more times
and avoid his arms to win this
simple battle.

+-------------------------------

With Bough Beater defeated,
Rocket will find another slime
chest. Open it to rescue His
Royal Wobbliness, the king of
Boingburg.

As you rescue the slime, Rocket
will be ambushed by a Plob tank.
The tank will chase you as you
flee to Boingburg. Simply run to
the left while avoiding the
shadows on the ground; bombs
will fall on their position.
It's really simple, and soon you
will reach the safety of
Boingburg while the tank
retreats.


================================
 4.05] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

Report to the castle to talk
with His Royal Wobbliness. The
king suggests that Rocket head
to the Tomb of Tootinschleiman
in order to recover a mystical
and legendary tank. After the
conversation, Rocket will
receive a Seed of Life, which
increases your heart count by
one!

Exit the castle and head to the
church. Walk behind the large
tree inside to find a second
Seed of Life! We're off to a
great start! Save your game and
proceed to Tootinschleiman's
Tomb.


================================
 4.06] TOOTINSCHLEIMAN'S TOMB   
================================

 Slimes: Namby, Perry, Bud, Goot

Walk up the staircase and ignore
the sealed wing portal as you
move to the north. In this area,
you will find a cannon as well
as a bombshell submerged in the
sand. Elasto Blast it out, then
throw it in the cannon. It'll
shoot out and destroy the nearby
sand dune, which reveals a slime
chest. Open it to rescue Namby.
Pick her up and move to the
northwest to the next area.
Throw her on the cart to send
the slime home and she will give
you a bombshell.

Break all of the stone obelisks
and throw them onto the cart.
Open the chests for Gold and
ship the Picksy to town via the
carts. Use the bombshell on the
northeast section of the area to
blast the sand dune to the left.
Elasto Blast the slime chest
that appears out of the dune to
rescue Perry. Throw him on a
cart and you'll get a Rockbomb.

Continue to the north past where
the sand dune was. Rocket will
witness a Plob member get
trapped beneath a sand dune. He
asks Rocket to help him by using
the cannon on the right side of
the area to blast him out of the
sand.

Unfortunately, the cannon cannot
be reached by normal means, and
you'll have to take a detour of
sorts. I guess the guy will have
to wait. Walk to the left and
jump in the ravine. Open the
slime chest to save Bud, and
carry him to the next area on
the left.

Throw him on one of the carts
and he will give you a wooden
arrow. Take all of the items and
enemies here and throw them on
the carts. Proceed to the north
and open the chest on the right.
The chest above it is a Mimic;
you might as well bring it to
town along with the others. From
where the Mimic stood, move to
the right to enter the next
section.

Step into the wing portal to be
transported to the entrance of
the level. You know, it helps.
Return through the wing portal.
Chuck the nearby bombshell into
the cannon to destroy the sand
dune. Wait for another bombshell
to appear, then throw it into
the cannon to destroy yet
another sand dune past the
previous one.

Like always, take all of the
items and enemies and throw them
onto the carts. Walk past where
the two sand dunes were and
continue to the north. Open the
chests for some Gold and
Medicinal Herbs, then move to
the right to reach the next
area.

Stowe all of the enemies here
onto the carts as well as chests
and obelisks, then proceed to
the right. You will find yet
another set of carts here, but
this time on a rail system. Take
the Hammerhoods and throw them
onto the cart, then go to the
south to reach some rapids. Step
onto the rapids to be well,
rapidly moved to the right. You
might spot a Goodybag running
around.

If you need to get to the other
side of the rapids, Elasto Blast
your way across. Catch the
Goodybag and throw him on a
cart. Go back to the other side
of the rapids and open the slime
chest to find Gootrude. Chuck
her on a cart and she'll send
you a letter and an obelisk.

Go south of where Gootrude
resided to find a small area
with a moveable cannon. Your
goal is to push the cannon
across the tracks until it
reaches the other end, but there
are many blocks in the way.
Destroy them all with an Elasto
Blast, then push the cannon to
the other side. Throw a
Bombshell in it to destroy the
sand dune, then continue on.

Finally, we've reached the
cannon! Throw a Bombshell in to
destroy the sand dune ahead,
then launch another one to free
the Plob member. His name is
Ducktor Cid, and as a token of
his appreciation, he will fix
the Warrior's Flute. Rocket will
play it, and all of a sudden, a
gigantic tank rises from the
sand!

This is the Schleiman Tank, and
it's one badass vehicle, piloted
by yours truly! As Ducktor Cid
brings Rocket inside, he
receives some unfortunate mail.
Apparently he has been fired
from the Plob for sucking so
much. Ha ha!


================================
 4.07] TANK INTERIOR            
================================

 Slimes: None

As the duo enters the tank,
Ducktor Cid decides to ally with
Rocket. Ducktor will teach you
the bare-bones basics of tank
battling as you use a mountain
as target practice. As a rock
falls from the nearby chute,
pick it up and throw it into a
cannon. It'll eventually hit the
mountain and damage it.

Explore the other rooms of the
tank and collect ammo to use
against the mountain. Once the
mountain is reduced to rubble,
the tutorial will end and you
will return to Boingburg.


================================
 4.08] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: Flantenna

Once you're back at town, pay a
visit to the king and tell him
about the tank. Afterwards, stop
by Ducktor's new abode. It's
more like a garage where Cid can
customize your tank. You cannot
to anything now, so leave. Also,
the 10St obstacle has been
removed from the nearby house.
Go inside and collect the Seed
of Life, then save at the
church.

Try to leave town and you will
be stopped by a member of the
Plob and his tank, The
Platypanzer. Ducktor suggests
you save your game, but you can
tell him off since you already
did so. Choose to fight The
Platypanzer, and get ready for
your first tank battle!
Exciting; very, very exciting!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Platypanzer |
HP: 50 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Websy (Two-tailed Platypu
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb

Your tutorial should have proved
useful when it comes to your
very first tank battle. Unlike
the mountain of course, The
Platypanzer fights back.
Nevertheless, Ducktor Cid will
still give you some basic
pointers before the fight
begins. The battle is painfully
simple even for your first one
since Websy, the leader, only
uses the top cannon. If you see
a projectile coming your way,
throw a boulder in the top
cannon to negate the attack.

Your tank only holds boulders
and bombshells. Since bombshells
are stronger than boulders, use
them in the bottom cannon to
ensure a perfect hit. Use your
large supply of boulders on the
top cannon to block any incoming
attack, and tossing the others
in the bottom cannon to speed
the fight up in your favor. Just
watch out for the extra-powerful
Rockbombs.

The Platypanzer only has 50 HP,
so you should have little
trouble here. Websy fires at a
fairly slow rate, so you could
probably throw most of your ammo
in the bottom cannon, using one
or two in the top when needed.
The key to winning any tank
battle is to never stop moving.

Remember: the fight doesn't end
when the opposing tank loses all
it's HP. Once you deplete every
last bit of it, you will have to
infiltrate the tank. Exit your
tank and bounce over to The
Platypanzer. Make a beeline to
the engine room, which is
straight ahead from the
entrance.

The engine room is guarded by a
trio of electrical pipes (the
number increases drastically in
later battles). Elasto Blasting
works fine, but doing so can be
a little on the slow side. I
often grab ammunition from
inside the tank to use against
the pipes. Once you are smack
dab in front of the heart-shaped
engine, Elasto Blast into it to
destroy The Platypanzer and win
the battle.

+-------------------------------

Rescue Flantenna from the nearby
chest as Ducktor Cid takes you
to his garage. You can upgrade
and repair the Schleiman Tank in
here, whether you want to
upgrade the tank's HP or swap
out ammo.

You'll start off by adding ammo
to your tank. It can hold 30
pieces of ammunition, so choose
wisely. Hopefully you've been
bringing stuff from the various
areas back to town, so you
should have some Rockbombs or
bombshells. Press X to read the
descriptions and pick 30 to fill
up the slots (keep in mind that
you have an unlimited amount of
boulders). After selecting your
tank's weapons, leave.

There still isn't all that much
to do in town, but you can pick
up a nice piece of ammo by
playing a fun minigame. Talk to
Perry near the bridge to
participate in the Gold Coast
Surfari. All you have to do is
collect at least 1800 coins
while surfing around in the
water. Use the D-Pad to move and
A to jump. It reminds me of the
bonus games from Donkey Kong
Country.

If you beat the old record,
you'll receive a piece of
orichalcum. It's by far your
most powerful weapon this early
in the game, so picking it up is
a must. That's really all there
is to do in Boingburg, so add
the orichalcum to your ammo
stock, save your game and return
to Tootinschleiman's Tomb.


================================
 4.09] TOOTINSCHLEIMAN'S TOMB   
================================

 Slimes: Goolia, Bunny, Poxie, C

Return to the Tomb of
Tootinschleiman (where you found
the Schleiman Tank) to encounter
a Cactiball named Spine Les (oh,
I get it). He talks smack before
running away to the left. Jump
down into the giant tank tread
marks. If you didn't rescue Bud
before, he'll be down here in
the ditch.

The next area is filled with
many sand dunes and a track. The
cannon here seems to be missing,
so continue west. Break the
slime chest to rescue Goolia,
then toss her onto a nearby
train. The rapids in the corner
of the area are moving towards
you, so it'll be hard to waltz
across. Instead, use an Elasto
Blast to shoot across to the
other side.

The next area is pretty large
and filled with more rapids.
Before messing around here, go
north to the next area. You'll
find plenty of Rockbombs in this
area if you want to stock up;
the train cars are here as well,
so it's rather easy to collect
plenty of ammo (and enemies).
Don't forget to also break open
the slime chest to free Poxie.

Stand next to the cannon and
push it into the rapids. Now
that it's on the other side of
the area, knock it to the end of
the track to line it up with a
sand dune. Use the nearby
bombshell to destroy the sand
dune, giving you access to
another slime. Free Bunny and
bring her back to town.

From the area with the rapids
and the cannon, take the
northeast exit to reach a tank
battle arena. Get on the stand
and prepare for a fight!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Platypanzer |
HP: 60 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Feathers (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb

We happen to be fighting The
Platypanzer again, so some
aspects of this battle will be
the same as the last. The ammo
is the same as before, but now
both cannons will be used due to
an increase in crew members. Now
you will really have to stay on
your toes and use both cannons
in effort of negating enemy
attacks. Try to use the top and
bottom cannon equally.

Your new ammo should be pretty
useful here. The Platypanzer
still has a relatively low
amount of HP, and Rockbombs and
obelisks work wonders here.
Using those two ammunitions can
be risky, since you cannot
afford dropping either one when
loading up the ammo (the
obelisks break and the
Rockbombs, of course, explode).
Stocking up your tank with those
two items can be a little risky,
but all it really means is that
you have to be extra careful.

Since there's more than one
opposing crew member, you face
the risk of being infiltrated.
Spine Les will often try to
enter your tank and sabotage it
(enemies can successfully
destroy your ammo ducts by
destroying the computer panels
on the walls).

When you spot Spine Les on the
top screen trying to enter your
tank, either knock him around
until he is killed (he'll then
revive back inside his own tank)
or hurl him in your cannon to
send his spiny butt back where
he belongs. He can even shoot
himself out of his own cannon to
successfully land in your own
tank! Of course, you can
infiltrate enemy tanks as well,
but doing so is not recommended
until you get your own crew
members.

The Platypanzer stands no chance
against your bombshells,
Rockbombs, and obelisks. Despite
doubling their crew, you should
have little trouble draining
their HP. Once the tank is
crippled, run over to the enemy
tank and destroy the engine
room. One of the crew members,
if not both, will try to stop
you, so destroy them and blast
the engine to win the tank
battle.

+-------------------------------

Curate Rollo will be rescued
following your victory. Feathers
may have been defeated, but
Spine Les still flees the
vicinity. Backtrack towards the
tomb again, stopping at the area
west of the tomb. The track here
has been restored and cannons
will move across the track.
There are three sand dunes here
that can be destroyed. Grab a
bombshell and toss it in the
cannon as it lines up with a
dune. Destroy all three sand
dunes here.

We can either go north or
southwest. Lets stray from the
main path for a moment and
proceed southwest to the dead
end. Ready for another tank
battle?


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Short Shooter |
HP: 70 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pickles (Two-tailed Picks
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Bombshell, 

Just by looking at the HP and
the ammo, this tank battle may
seem tougher than the rest. In
fact, it's quite possibly the
easiest one yet. Pickles, for
whatever reason, announces which
cannon he will be depositing his
ammo in. He is no liar, so pay
attention to his comments.

If he uses the bottom cannon,
dispense nearly all of your ammo
into the bottom cannon to
neutralize his attacks. Every
once in a while, when the coast
is clear, shoot one or two of
your stronger ammo in the top
cannon to ensure a direct hit
(like your orichalcum or
Rockbombs). If he switches to
the top cannon, flip your
strategy so you direct most of
your fire to the top cannon.

Sometimes Pickles will shoot
himself out of one of the
cannons. If you see this happen,
shoot him down and quickly throw
all of your ammo into the
cannons to attack Short Shooter
while the leader crashes to the
floor. This is one of the easier
tank battles, so it should end
rather quickly. Remember to go
and break the engine once Short
Shooter runs out of HP.

+-------------------------------

After receiving your reward and
freeing another slime, return to
the previous area and head north
to continue following Spine Les.

Rescue Goodith from the chest
near the entrance and throw her
onto a raft back to Boingburg.
Jump into the portal in the
corner to open up a path leading
to the entrance of the Tomb of
Tootinschleiman. Head back
through the portal.

Grab a bombshell nearby and
throw it into the cannon to
destroy one of two sand dunes.
Wait for the bombshell to
respawn, then use it to take
down the second one. You have
now successfully created a
shortcut back towards the
earlier section of the area.

Don't forget to open the chest
between the two sand dunes for a
Seed of Life! After recruting
some enemies and bringing
objects back to town, take the
north exit.

Spine Les will ambush you up
ahead and knock you right into a
tank battle arena. Wow, how
incredibly convenient for him.
Well, guess we're gonna have to
fight again!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Purrsecutor |
HP: 100 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pyjamas (Two-tailed Jailc
 Ammo: Bombshell, Obelisk, Rockb

This is most definitely your
toughest battle yet. The
Purrsecutor rivals the Schleiman
Tank on nearly every level: HP,
ammo, and crew members. It has
some wicked ammo that can really
put a dent in your armor. You'll
certainly have to be on your
toes when fighting against this
opponent.

If possible, try to use your
weaker ammo as fodder (boulders,
chests) while using your
stronger weapons to actually
damage the enemy tank
(orichalcum, Rockbombs).
Remember that you can cycle
through objects that you are
carrying by pressing R; you
throw the bottom one first.

The Jailcat always tries to
infiltrate your tank, so you
will often have to fend it off
while simultaneously attacking
The Purrsecutor. You most likely
don't have any catnips as
distraction, so kill it instead.
The Jailcat will come back for
more after death, but at least
you have an opening to attack
while it is being resurrected.

Sometimes Pyjamas will also try
to directly attack your tank as
well. While this seems like a
pain, it also means that no one
is manning their tank. Use this
opportunity to load as much ammo
into your cannons as possible.
Cycle back and forth between
killing crew members and loading
ammo into the cannons until the
tank is destroyed. From there,
hurry up and take out the
engine.

+-------------------------------

Looks like Spine Les still isn't
out of the picture! Ignore him
for now and rescue the slime,
who then drags Rocket back to
Boingburg.


================================
 4.10] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

The mysterious cyborg slime
brings you to the garage and
introduces himself as
Slimechanic. He is in charge of
increasing the Schleiman Tank's
HP. Start off by coughing up 50
Gold to purchase the "HP Taster"
upgrade. I suggest buying at
least one other upgrade
afterwards. Also don't forget to
update your ammo supply before
leaving.

Save your game and return to the
Tomb of Tootinschleiman.


================================
 4.11] TOOTINSCHLEIMAN'S TOMB   
================================

 Slimes: Rustle Sprout, Startist

Back to pursuing Spine Les! Use
the portal near the entrance for
easy access in returning to the
room where you last encountered
Spine Les. Go north after a word
with the Cactiball. Follow the
track here to find the cannon.
Push it into the rapids as it
reaches the next half of the
train track. Push it south, then
jump inside to get shot across
the rapids.

You will land on a small strip
of land with a bombshell and a
second cannon. Grab the
bombshell and push the cannon
north. Toss the shell inside to
bust down a sand dune in the
distance. Ride the rapids back
to the west side of the area and
pass by the remains of the dune
to find another slime chest.
Rescue Rustle Sprout from the
chest and go two screens back to
return him to town.

Take the northeast exit once
back on track. Free Startist
from the chest out in the open
and continue north. You'll find
plenty of Rockbombs and
Hammerhoods here, so load 'em
all up on the long train track
to haul them back to town.

Also check the small alcove at
the top of the area for a total
of three, yes three, slime
chests! You'll find Shelby,
Prince Pigummy, and Curedon Bleu
all inside. Send them back to
town and return to the last
area. From here, go south to
spot Spine Les again, who runs
away.

This place is big, yet fairly
empty aside from a few enemies.
Out of the three chests in the
center, two of them are Mimics.
Surprise them and send these
rare enemies back to Boingburg.
Also activate the wing portal
before going south. Destroy the
sand dune here to create yet
another shortcut, then return to
the last area and follow Spine
Les to the right.

Get ready for another tank
battle. You will meet a
mysterious slime named Slival,
who seems to hold some high
power (Spine Les addresses him
as a superior). Hop onto the
pedestal and use your flute to
begin the fight.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Golemator |
HP: 150 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Duckles (Two-tailed Platy
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb, Bombsh

This is a doozy of a fight.
Hopefully you upgraded the
Schleiman Tank's HP to around
190, because you'll need the
durability when going up against
weapons such as iron balls.
These things can deal 26 points
of damage, so make it your first
priority to knock them out of
the sky before they can connect.

Don't worry if you have to go
into a defensive stance in this
battle, because Cactiballs will
also try to attack your tank
from the inside. Worrying about
three crew members can be a
hassle, so try to take them out
quickly. Having one of your ammo
ducts destroyed can be a huge
handicap in this tank battle.
Either kill the Cactiballs or
use them as ammo.

If you tend to be in a bit of a
stalemate (it's not uncommon),
try infiltrating The Golemator
and destroying one of their ammo
ducts or crew members. Entering
from the ground may take a while
since you have to destroy the
door, and shooting through the
sky is risky because you may
collide with ammunition and fall
to the ground. Choose either
strategy, then damage the tank
from the inside.

Don't panic if your tank reaches
0 HP. You can still man the
cannons even with a banged-up
tank, so the battle isn't over
if you run out of HP. Just guard
the doors and eliminate any
enemy that tries to enter. Once
you deplete the enemy tank's HP
as well, ditch the Schleiman
Tank and head to their engine
room. The crew members will stay
and defend their own tank
instead of targeting your engine
room, so you'll pretty much be
in the clear.

+-------------------------------

After winning, Slival shows just
how awesome he is before
leaving. Rescue Hooly from the
slime chest, then return to
town. Since all the slimes in
Tootinschleiman's Tomb have been
rescued, you will receive a
Steel Broadsword as a bonus
prize.


================================
 4.12] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

After getting your next mission
from His Royal Wobbliness,
Ducktor Cid will bring you to
the garage. You can now assemble
a crew of three slimes to
accompany you during tank
battles. Each crew member has
their own special abilities
that'll help you out during
fights. I went with Hooly,
Swotsy, and Blubba. Since you
have a limited amount of crew
members at this point, you don't
have many choices.

Of course, also tweak your ammo
and upgrade your tank's HP if
necessary, then exit the garage.
Now that you have at least 20
rescued slimes, the two 20St
iron balls that were blocking
the west side of town are gone.
Unfortunately, there really
isn't anything to do here.

Our next mission is at Mt.
Krakatroda, but lets head back
to Forewood Forest first. We
still need to rescue the rest of
the slimes there.


================================
 4.13] FOREWOOD FOREST          
================================

 Slimes: Speckles, Sheala, Jumpy
  Goozanna, Tickled Pink

Move forward to encounter
Wiseguy and his Platypunk
lackey. Follow them through the
forest as they try to find you.
When you reach the area with the
large tree trunk and railway,
head north. Wiseguy and Babbo
lower the rope leading up to a
wooden ledge. Climb up after
them and free Speckles from the
chest, then return to the
previous area to send him back
to Boingburg.

From where you found Speckles,
go north. A three-way fork lies
in front of you; I suggest going
right to fight a tank battle.
It's best to get it over with
early, ya know?


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Purrsecutor |
HP: 180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Boiglar (Two-tailed Jailc
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Oaken Club,

Before you do anything at all,
press Start to assign commands
to your crew. Luckily, crew
members in this game are pretty
competant. This battle should
actually be fairly easy
considering you have three very
good crew members.

I personally had Hooly, Swotsy,
and Baron Blubba as my crew.
Swotsy and Blubba manned the
lower and upper cannons
respectively, while Hooly
infiltrated the enemy tank and
tore it to shreds. They rarely
slack off, so these two do a
pretty good job at attacking The
Purrsecutor on their own. Plus,
Hooly will be distracting the
enemy crew, giving them little
time to attack (or defend).

Since the cannons are covered,
you do not really have to focus
on them yourselves. Instead, hop
into a cannon yourself and fire
yourself into The Purrsecutor.
Help out Hooly by attacking the
Jailcats and destroying their
ammo ducts. From here, just wait
until your crew destroys The
Purrsecutor on their own. Since
you're already inside, scamper
off to the engine room and
finish the job.

+-------------------------------

After rescuing Sheala, return to
the previous area.

Head north and climb the rope on
the right to encounter the
Platypunk duo again. They test
out the ramps on the tracks,
which rides all the way to the
other side of the area. Follow
them and jump off before
entering the tunnel leading back
to town.

If you want a wooden arrow, you
can find one below the second
ramp. Instead of riding the car
across the track, go the long
way to find a chest containing
the wooden arrow.

Free Jumpy, then lower the rope
on the right so you don't have
to ride the dang rail car
anymore. Climb back up, chuck
Jumpy onto the train car behind
you, then follow the path south,
then west.

Ignore the rail car at the top
of the ramp for now and climb
down the rope below. You can't
do anything about the slime
chest on top of the moving car
as well, so pass by. Break open
the chest underneath the
southern ramp for a Seed of
Life, then return to the rail
car.

Jump on and ride it down and
across the track. You will be
stopped by a rock wall, which
destroys the rail car. Grab the
Rockbomb nearby and use it to
destroy the wall blocking the
track. Follow the track on foot
to find another slime chest on
top of a rail cart. Push it to
the right until it is blocking
the intersection, then return to
the rock wall's former location.

Ride the rail car south of here
to crash into the car holding
the slime chest. After the
collision, break open the chest
to free Plopstar; bring him a
few screens back to the train
tracks.

From the train tracks, go south,
then west. Back here again. Ride
the rail car again, this time
passing where the rock wall was.
You will slam into the slime
chest that was blocking the
intersection. Clever, eh? Free
Starthur from his bright blue
prison. Now that the hazards are
out of the way, this area
becomes another active train
station. Throw Starthur on a
rail car and take the western
exit.

Ignore the rope ladders below
and continue west to another
tank battle arena.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Crono Twigger |
HP: 150 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Guaca Moly (Two-tailed Mi
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Oaken Club,

Oh lordy, pun of the century.
The Crono Twigger (I chuckle
every time I hear it) isn't much
of a threat offensively, but it
has the ability to heal itself
with the use of medicinal herbs.
When loaded into a cannon, it
will heal the tank. Of course,
you can steal these herbs from
the tank and use it on yourself
if you so desire.

This is actually a pretty easy
battle. Crono Twigger has less
than stellar HP and its ammo
isn't too threatening. Hooly can
single-handedly take care of the
entire crew over there, while
you can either help him out or
dish out the damage even faster
alongside your two other crew
members. Even with the 20 HP-
healing power of the medicinal
herbs, they are no match for
your weapons.

+-------------------------------

Earl Luminum will be saved after
defeating Chrono Twigger.
Backtrack one screen, then take
the stairs on the left. Lower
yourself down the long rope to a
dead end and a slime chest.
After rescuing George, bring him
back one screen to the rail cars
to send him off home.

Next, take the stairs on the
right and slide down the rope.
In the next area, a Dracky and
Bunicorn conversing about the
nearby statue. In order to open
the path ahead of you, you must
mimic the statue. From top to
bottom, the statue goes as:

- chest
- pompom
- Bunicorn

The Bunicorn and chest are right
next to you, whereas the pompom
lies in the previous area next
to the rope. Press R to switch
the arrangement until it matches
the statue. Stand on the
pedestal to open the pathway.

You will find Goozanna just past
the two statues. Grab her and
any other enemy/item you find,
then jump in the portal south of
here. You'll appear on the other
side of the fence, which is
conveniently right at the
entrance of Forewood Forest.
Dump the stuff onto the train
cars, then go back through the
portal.

Grab two Bunicorns here, then go
back through the portal. Snag a
Jailcat and go south to reach
the entrance of the forest. Walk
between the bunch of trees to
the right to find another
statue:

- Bunicorn
- Jailcat
- Bunicorn

Arrange them as so to open up
the wall. Follow the clearing to
yet another tank battle arena.
Accept the challene.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Carrot Top | HP:
200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Patty Puss (Two-tailed Pl
 Ammo: Iron Ball, Oaken Club, Fi

A full crew and powerful weapons
stand in front of you in this
tank battle. Dealing with a
total of four enemies can be
more difficult, so make sure to
send Hooly over to the tank to
help distract them. You should
really defend against the
ammunition, so it's not
recommended that you leave your
tank.

The Carrot Top wields some nasty
ammo as well as a "secret
weapon" of sorts. When Patty
Puss mentions "you-know-what",
get ready to guard the Schleiman
Tank. The giant drill on the
front of the Carrot Top soars
towards your tank. Fire anything
and everything out of the lower
cannon to help destroy it. If it
reaches your tank, it will bore
into the front, dealing 40
damage nearly every second! It
will be destroyed after around
10 shots from the lower cannon.

If you manage to destroy the
drill, the crew will abandon all
hope and instead charge at the
Schleiman Tank. If Baron Blubba
is on your team, order him to
keep baddies out and give him a
hand between loading up the
cannons. The three Bunicorns
should not cause much trouble if
you keep 'em in line.

+-------------------------------

Well, that's a wrap! Tickled
Pink is the last slime here in
Forewood Forest, so head back to
Boingburg. As an added bonus,
you will obtain an orichalcum
for rescuing all slimes here.

Do the essentials like stocking
up on ammo and upgrading your
tank. Your destination is now
Mt. Krakatroda, so save and
continue your quest.


================================
 4.14] MT. KRAKATRODA           
================================

 Slimes: Kworry, Mag Max, Itsy, 
  Dummy, Splatrick, Rocky, Bitsy
  Merc, Lady Poly

Upon entering Mt. Krakatroda for
the first time, head to the
right. Spend some time hauling
new enemies and items onto the
train car. Grab the
thousandweight in the corner of
the area and before chucking it
onto a car, walk to the right.
You will find an overturned
slime chest; toss the
thousandweight to create a huge
tremor, flipping the chest over.
Free Kworry, then chuck him on a
car.

Ascend the western staircase and
rescue Mag Max. Take him and the
boomerang back to Boingburg. The
crystal wall at the top of the
staircase blocks your path, so
instead continue to the right.

Pick up the chimaera wing
nearby. These neat lil' items
can directly transport whatever
it touches (except you, of
course) to Boingburg. You can
try throwing it at the Platypunk
nearby, but that might be a
waste of a good item. Instead,
follow the path to another slime
chest. Open it to rescue Itsy,
then use the chimaera wing on
her.

Elasto Blast through the
mushrooms (or simply go around).
The Wyrtle here is too tough to
be beaten by your little self.
In order to defeat one, toss a
thousandweight to flip him over,
then Elasto Blast or pick him
up. While it may not be as easy,
a charged-up Elast Blast will
knock him over as well.
Alternatively, you can use the
chimaera wing in the southeast
corner to send him right to
town. Proceed to the next area.

Blast through the mushrooms and
you will find another overturned
chest. Go up the stairs to find
the thousandweight, then use it
to free Dragory. Send him on his
way, then continue to the right.
The next screen contains several
Wyrtles, a Rockbomb, and a
thousandweight. You'll need the
Rockbomb for later use, so
ignore all the enemies and grab
the Rockbomb. Return to the
previous screen.

Climb up the stairs and use the
Rockbomb to destroy the rock
wall, then move through the
rubble. Approach the gap to be
given a little clue about
crossing. You must use the two
bungee cords to get you across
this large gap. In order to do
so, charge your Elasto Blast
towards the side of one of the
two bungee cords in a diagnol
fashion. Letting go will result
in you bouncing back and forth
in a zig-zag pattern, ultimately
reaching the other side.

Take the chimaera wing and slide
down the rope to create an easy
pathway from here to the ground.
Go back up and to the next area.
Step onto the platform here and
engage in another tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Cyclown | HP:
180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pickaro (Two-tailed Picks
 Ammo: Boomerang, Shuriken, Iron

Rescuing the extra slimes in
Forewood Forest should have
really helped you prepare for
this battle. Pickaro fights more
of a defensive battle since most
of his ammunition consists of
boomerangs, which can track down
incoming ammo and destroy it.
Your crew should be able to
handle some of the pressure
brought on by The Cyclown.

If Hooly is in your group (I
don't know why he wouldn't be),
have him storm the enemy tank.
Continue loading up your tank
cannons while he gets a head
start; you can either abandon
your post and help Hooly while
your gang continues your duty or
stick in your tank and let the
lil' guy do all the work. Either
way, the battle will be simple
enough. With Hooly distracting
the crew members, no one will be
able to defend your attacks.

+-------------------------------

Anjello will be rescued and you
will receive another item.
Return to the previous screen.
Shoot back across the bungee
cords and go up the northern
steps. Free Goopid from the
chest in this area. Use the
chimaera wings on Goopid and an
enemy, then continue to reach a
locked door. The two Platypunks
reveal that Slival has the key
and run to the right.

Instead of following them, go to
the left instead. There is a
slime here to rescue. Climb down
the steps and collect all the
chimaera wings. Use them on the
Wyrtles and other items before
returning at the top of the
stairs. Ricochet off the bungee
cords leading south. You should
reach the raised platform if you
start by bouncing off the cord
on the right.

The bungee cords here bend in a
90-degree angle. Bounce off the
bottom cord and you should reach
the northern platform. The final
bungee cords are tough to get
across because there are gaps in
the middle. Position yourself so
you Elasto Blast right in the
center of the top cord; you
should make it to the platform
containing Dummy. Send him home
on a chimaera wing and go back
one screen.

Head to the right this time,
where you will find some
monsters and chimaera wings.
Send them back to Boingburg with
the wings and grab one of the
sleeping Rockbombs in the
corner. Use it to destroy the
rock wall past the staircase and
move on. Rescue Splatrick, who
is off to the left. Use a
chimaera wing on him and the
remaining ones on enemies. Make
sure to lower the rope on the
left before taking the north
exit.

Grab the two Wyrtles here and
smash all the jars for some
extra Gold. Don't forget to free
Rocky from the chest here as
well. As for the piggy bank...
ignore it for now; we cannot
open it just yet. If you need
chimaera wings for these guys,
return to the previous area.

Head to the right for another
statue "puzzle". From top to
bottom:

- thousandweight
- Rockbomb
- Imp

First off, free Bitsy from the
chest below the train tracks and
send the slime back to
Boingburg. Backtrack to the
previous area to find Imps and
Rockbombs. From here, backtrack
another screen to find a
thousandweight. Arrange them in
the proper order, then return to
the statue. Step on the pedestal
and let the magic happen.

With the path opened, continue
to the next screen. You will
find Slival here acting as
badass as ever, so why not match
him and challenge him to a tank
battle? Get get!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Boomerang, Steel Broadswo

Don't be lured into a false
sense of security just because
Slival is the only one you have
to worry about here. I'm not
sure how, but he can load his
tank cannons up like a mutha.
He's insanely quick and stocking
his cannons and getting the ammo
out, and even Hooly will have a
hard time trying to keep Slival
at bay.

Slival definitely has some nasty
weapons. His iron shields serve
as great cover for steel
broadswords and iron arrows,
while his boomerangs will cut
down your incoming ammo in a
flash. Remember to use your
weaker ammo to nullify the enemy
ammo while saving your best
pieces for damaging Slival's
tank. Your orichalcums and BS-1
Croozes should put a real dent
into the Schwarzman Tank.

While it seems very dangerous,
infiltrating the tank yourself
is the key to winning the tank
battle with ease. By now, your
tank should have high-enough HP
to withstand a full-on assault
(around 290 HP is reasonable).
Have your crew members take
cannon duties and enter the
Schwarzman Tank with Hooly.
Attack Slival yourself while
Hooly destroys the ammo ducts.

The Schwarzman Tank has an
interesting design setup. The
back room is not accessible by
the foyer; instead you must go
through the artillery room to
reach the back room. As a
result, you can basically take
the artillery room "hostage" so
to speak. Keep attacking Slival
and don't let him enter the
room, which means he won't be
able to use the cannons. Since
he can only access it through
the foyer, you only have to
guard the southern doorway.

Since Slival literally will not
be able to attack your tank at
all, your crew members should
(slowly) do the job for you
themselves. The engine room is a
bit bigger than in previous tank
battles, so keep that in mind as
well. Also, Slival will bolt to
the engine room in pursuit, so
take the time to knock him silly
if he shows up in an effort to
stop you.

+-------------------------------

Defeating Slival and his tank
will earn you a steel broadsword
as well asfreeing Flanpa. Slival
also hands over the Mt.
Krakatroda key, and Flanpa helps
Rocket unlock the door. Go
through the door into the ruins.

Jump into the wing portal to
create a shortcut leading to the
entrance of themountain. Go back
through to the ruins. Take the
slime knight lying on theground
and immediately go to the right.
Chop down the spider web in your
way to reach the next area.

There are plenty of Imps here,
so either slice 'em down or use
the three chimaera wings to send
their purple butts back to
Boingburg. Enter the slime-
shaped tunnel to reach another
tank battle arena. You know what
to do next.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Fort Knight | HP:
180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Dan Fango (Two-tailed Dra
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Iron Ball

After dealing with a guy like
Slival, this chump should be no
problem. The Fort Knight only
contains iron shields and iron
balls. While iron shields are
very annoying, iron balls move
pathetically slow and are an
easy target for incoming
ammunition fire. Use your weaker
ammo like bombshells to bring
down the iron shields and save
the heavy hitters to actually
hurt the Fort Knight.

Another (risky) strategy is to
completely ignore all incoming
ammo. Dan Fango usually only
uses one of the two cannons
because he likes to send out an
iron shield followed by a few
iron balls. You can try and
protect your tank or send all
your ammo towards the unguarded
cannon to ensure clean hits.

The Fort Knight has a nice
amount of HP, and all the iron
shields may prove to be a
problem in damaging the tank.
This battle may take a bit
longer than usual. I don't want
to sound like a broken record,
but infiltrating and sabotaging
an enemy tank isn't always such
a bad idea. If you want to stick
around and completely overwhelm
the enemy crew with your slew of
awesome ammo, that's fine by me.
Either way: you shouldn't have
that much difficulty in taking
down the Fort Knight.

+-------------------------------

After rescuing Diablob, return
to the previous screen. Pick up
the slime knight from the middle
of the tunnel. When on your
head, press Y to attack with the
knight. Slice apart the spider
webs and the Platypunk, then
save Count Dragoola from the
chest. Continue to the left.

Defeat the enemies (or toss them
onto the train) and collect the
items from the jars and chests.
Also free Merc from the chest
and toss him onto the train.
Always keep the slime knight
with you. If you accidentally
throw it on a train car back to
Boingburg, return to the
entrance of the ruins to find
another one in the same exact
spot. When ready, chop down the
spider web blocking the passage
and move on.

Pick up the chimaera wing and
use it in the Living Statue up
ahead; it's the easiest way to
defeat them. Like earlier in the
stage, ignore the crystal wall
and continue north, picking up
as many chimaera wings as you
can.

When you reach the room with the
rapids, right to the east side.
Step on the small strip of land
to find a slime chest. Open it
to free Lady Poly, then use a
chimaera wing on her. Head to
the north end of the room and
jump into the wing portal.

You will be teleported to a room
filled with three chimaera wings
and three Living Statues. I
think you can figure out what to
do. If for any reason you run
out of chimaera wings, a fully-
charged Elasto Blast will do the
job as well. You must defeat all
three Living Statues to make the
gate open.

Before going through, enter the
second wing portal to activate
the one at the entrance of the
level. When ready, proceed
through the gate to enter a
hallway. Step on the strange
bird symbol on the floor to
refill your health, then enter
the double doors to reach the
boss room.


+-----------------+
| BOSS: Pot Belly |
+-----------------+-------------

Ah, another incredibly simple
boss. The first of the Plob's
Big Three, Pot Belly will use
the mystical Krak Pot to create
random items, ranging from
chimaera wings to bananas. The
only way to hurt, and
subsequently defeat, Pot Belly
is by using his items against
him.

Pot Belly will throw rocks (???)
in the Krak Pot, then runs
around as it spews items out
into the air. If it happens to
be Rockbombs or fire water, keep
away from the giant explosions
that are created when they fall
to the ground. If he pulls
bananas out, avoid the banana
peels that are left so you don't
slip.

When Pot Belly pulls chimaera
wings out of the Krak Pot, grab
as many as you can. Once he
finally stops, toss one at him.
The only thing keeping the wings
from transporting the big lug to
Boingburg is the ceiling. He
will fly upwards and slam into
the ceiling, losing a bit of his
health.

The battle doesn't really get
any harder. Occasionally
medicinal herbs are the product
of the Krak Pot, in which you
can use them to heal yourself.
Most of the time Pot Belly will
hurt himself by slipping on
banana peels or getting hit by
Rockbombs, so you don't really
have to worry about much in this
fight.

+-------------------------------

Rocket will take the Krak Pot as
his prize after vanquishing Pot
Belly. Pick it up and step into
the teleporter to return to
Boingburg.


================================
 4.15] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

After waking up and leaving your
home, Flanpa will bring you to a
wagon next to the garage to show
you just what the Krak Pot is
capable of. He then gives you an
iron shield recipe and the
necessary ingredients to create
one. If you have not figured it
out yet, you can create new
items by fusing old ones
together with alchemy.

Choose the iron shield recipe
and agree to make one as the
Krak Pot does all the rest.
Alchemy is incredibly useful and
can be used to create some of
the best items in the game, so
don't pass it up late in the
game! As always, upgrade your
tank and restock your ammo
cache, then save your game.

You can visit a new area now
that you have 50 slimes. You can
access the museum now that you
have freed Crystal Chronicler.
If you have captured at least 30
of one type of monster, speak
with them to recruit them as a
crew member. The 50St in front
of the Goonin Spy Hole is gone,
but you haven't rescued the
three Goonin slimes yet! We will
have to wait a little bit before
we can see what they have in
store.

As you try to leave Boingburg,
Ductor Cid will stop you. He
tells Rocket to head to
Backwoods, where his sister is
being held.


================================
 4.16] BACKWOODS                
================================

 Slimes: Early Burly, Drake, Goo

Backwoods is a very tiny level
composed of several tank battle
arenas. You'll meet up with the
leaders upon entering Backwoods,
who scram after making fun of
Rocket for falling for the phony
letter. Well if Bo is really
being held captive here, then
the letter can't be that phony,
right?

Head to the main hub of
Backwoods. You will find some
carts as well as three entrances
to tank battle arenas. The gate
leading to the final tank battle
arena is closed.

The only enemy you can find here
in Backwoods are Goodybags. The
only area in the level they will
appear in is this one (you will
usually find them running around
the patch of leaves). This is
the easiest place to find
Goodybags since all you need to
do is enter the area, see if one
is there, then leave.

Keep repeating the process until
you find one, then chuck it on
the train cart. If you're really
dedicated in getting 30
Goodybags, this is by far the
simplest way to do it.

First off, go through the trees
in the northwest corner to find
a small grove. Open the two
slime chests to free Early Burly
and Drake, then open the chest
in the center for a Seed of
Life. Send the two slimes back
to town, then head off to one of
the tank battle arenas. I'll
start from the bottom up, but
you can fight them in any order
you'd like.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Carrot Top | HP:
250 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Bugsy (Two-tailed Bunicor
 Ammo: Iron Arrow, Iron Ball, St

Carrot Top should not prove to
be too much of a threat, even
with its beefed- up HP. You
should have a new and improved
tank complete with new ammo and
possibly even a new crew. I was
able to swap out Swotsy with a
Jailcat, then also kept Hooly
and Baron Blubba. Have Blubba
load the upper cannon and keep
baddies out if they storm the
tank, and have the other two
infiltrate and sabotage.

Bugsy only uses three different
types of ammo, so you should
know how to defend against each
one. Your own tank should be
chuck full o' iron shields and
other goodies, so this tank
battle should be a breeze
overall. If you hear Bugsy
command the crew to use the
Death Carrot, toss an iron
shield and some other weak ammo
through the lower cannon to
prevent it from hitting your
tank.

Once the enemy's plan is foiled,
they will charge the tank. Order
Blubba to keep baddies out and
bring Jailcat and Hooly back.
Help Blubba while the other two
fire at Carrot Top. You've
already fought Carrot Top
before, so you should be aware
of all the tricks they can pull
out of their hat.

+-------------------------------

You will rescue Goosashi. Head
to the next tank battle arena.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Pyramaniac |
HP: 200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Dracky Dan (Two-tailed Dr
 Ammo: Spooklear Bomb, Iron Ball

The Pyramaniac's artillery
consists mainly of spooklear
bombs. These weapons will pass
through all other ammo until it
connects with your tank. The
only way to negate the weapon is
by using holy water. You may
actually have some holy water in
your ammo cache (I had around
three), but even they won't be
enough to stop all the spooklear
bombs Dracky Dan has at his
disposal.

Since your ammo cannot stop
spooklear bombs, you can
actually use this to your
advantage. The Pyramaniac will
occasionally devote one cannon
to only firing spooklear bombs.
Fire all your powerful ammo the
same direction, since your ammo
will pass right through the
spooklear bombs undetected. All
that's left are iron balls and
thousandweights, which are
really slow-moving ammunition;
you should have no trouble
stopping them.

Since the Pyramaniac has low HP
and you should have at least one
infiltrator running amok over
there, this battle should not
last very long at all. The
Walking Corpses pose little
threat when you enter the tank
yourself, so just pass them as
you bolt to the engine room.

The engine room is a little
confusing to follow, since there
are two paths to take. Ignore
the bottom path as it leads to a
dead end. Follow the upper
passage to eventually reach the
engine.

+-------------------------------

After freeing Gooshido, head to
the third tank battle arena.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Chrono Twigger |
HP: 250 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Molone (Two-tailed Mischi
 Ammo: Oaken Club, Steel Broadsw

The Crono Twigger only has two
real pieces of ammunition: the
oaken club and steel broadsword.
Since the steel broadswords are
the more powerful of the two,
defend against them more than
the oaken clubs. By now, your
crew members and deadly ammo
should be enough to take care of
this tank. It does use strong
medicines every once in a while,
which heals tht tank for 30 HP.

You should breeze through this
tank battle. Aside from the
occasional Mischievous Mole that
tries to break into your tank,
the Crono Twigger poses little
threat to the Schleiman Tank. It
only uses oaken clubs and steel
broadswords to attack your own,
while it will sometimes heal
itself for 30 HP with a strong
medicine.

You should be dealing more than
the tank is healing, so it won't
take long for this machine to be
destroyed. Keep in mind that
once the enemy tank reaches zero
HP, the strong medicine will
have no effect on it (meaning it
won't go from zero to 30 HP; the
item just won't do anything).

+-------------------------------

Tokyo Tom will be freed, and the
gate leading to the final tank
battle arena is now open. Head
through the gate and do your
stuff. After a short scuffle,
you're back face-to-face with
Slival, so hopefully you have
enough spunk to finish him off
for the second time in a row!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 300 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Steel Broadsword, Iron Sh

Even though Slival says he upped
his game from before... he
really hasn't. Sure, he's
acquired some fancy new weapons,
but his fighting tactics stay
relatively unchanged. As opposed
to previous tank battles, keep
two of your crew members on
cannon duty while one
infiltrates the enemy.

Your other crew members should
load the cannons. Jailcat can
fire like crazy and Baron Blubba
can carry a nice amount of ammo
on his head. You'll need all the
help you can get fending off
hordes of steel broadswords and
pesky iron shields. Like your
last encounter with Slival, stay
on the defensive for the
majority of the battle. It's
more important conserving your
own health than depleting his
quickly.

If your infiltration strategy
worked wonders last time, don't
hesitate to try it again. Like I
said, this battle is more or
less the same ast the last one,
so you can easily keep Slival
from loading the cannons while
your crew attacks his own.

Either strategy works fine, but
be aware that this is a tough
fight; don't be alarmed if your
tank comes close to being (or
is) destroyed. Slival still
needs to destroy your engine to
win the tank battle, and Baron
Blubba is one huge obstacle to
get around!

+-------------------------------

Slival is defeated again, you
rescue your sister Bo; what a
great day! The two will return
to Boingburg. You'll also
receive a clap trap for rescuing
all slimes in Backwoods!


================================
 4.17] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

After waking up from a nap,
Rocket will be abruptly
introduced to the Gooshins.
There really aren't many places
to explore even with the
addition of the Backwoods
slimes, so make any necessary
changes to your tank and save.

Try to exit town for a scene.
The Goonins will stop you again
and reveal the location of your
parents: Callmigh Bluff. No
sense wasting time, so lets go
there right now!


================================
 4.18] CALLMIGH BLUFF           
================================

 Slimes: Gregg, Sir Sudsy, Duke 

At the start of the level,
follow the trail past the train
tracks. In the next screen, grab
the slime knight and proceed up
the stairs. Remember, you cannot
destroy the crystal walls just
yet, so ignore the ones you have
seen so far.

Enter the base of the mountain.
Once inside, free Gregg, who is
just off the beaten path to the
left. Bring him (and the rest of
the items) back to the train
carts.

Return to where you found Gregg
and climb up the rope. You will
find Walking Corpses up here,
who tend to hide underground and
pop up from under right at your
feet. Defeat them and rescue Sir
Sudsy to the left. Go south to
exit the cave. You will find
another set of carts here, so
deposit your load onto the
carts. Enter the western side of
the cave.

Go up the rope ladder to the
next area, where you will find a
slime chest. You cannot reach it
just yet, so cross the bridge
and go through the opening up
ahead.

As you can see from the sign
above the doorway, we are on
level 3. Cross the walkway to
the left and head into the left
side of the cave. Now that we
are under the bridge (good song,
if you catch my drift), open the
slime chest to free Duke
Swellington. Hold onto the big
lug and bring him back to the
rail carts on level 2.

Return to this location and
climb up the rope ladder. As you
follow the narrow path, you'll
encounter two slime chests that
are just out of reach. Big Daddy
manages to free himself from his
chest, then rescues Mama Mia as
well. He then uses a Master
Blast to destroy the crystal
wall blocking you from your
parents. After the reunion, the
three return to Boingburg.


================================
 4.19] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

Although Big Daddy put his back
out from using the Master Blast,
he tells Rocket to learn the
move himself via the Goonin
Trials. You can find the Goonins
in the hole to the left of the
king's palace. Drop in to reach
their not-so-secret "secret
hideout".

To complete the Goonin Trials,
you must go through three tests:
mind, skill, and body. Start off
with mind first by Elasto
Blasting into the poster.

Talk to Goosashi to begin the
Trial of the Mind. You must
supply Ducktor Cid with enough
firewood so he can take a nice
bath. In order to find the wood,
you must Elasto Blast and
destroy every man-made object in
the room. Trees and rocks are
ruled out of course, to Elasto
Blast the wooden statues and
stone lanterns.

When you have three pieces of
firewood, toss them into the
fire. There are only ten to
twelve pieces of wood and as far
as I know there is no time
limit, so there is no pressure
on you. Successfully burning
Ducktor Cid's bum will end the
trial.

Next up is Trial of Skill. In
order to win, you must catch
Gooshido by using your patented
Elasto Blast. Unfortunately, he
has summoned an army of look-
alikes. Once you catch a fake,
they will disappear. The
dopplegangers will run away if
you get too close, so you can
either sneak up on them with a
fully charged Elasto Blast or
catch them.

It always seems that no matter
what, the last person you catch
always happens to be the real
one. I don't know if you can
actually catch Gooshido before
eliminating all the fakes.
Either way, you'll win the Trial
of Skill once you capture
Gooshido.

The final test is the Trial of
the Body. Enter Tokyo Tom's dojo
to begin the trial. All you have
to do is find Tokyo Tom to
complete the trial. Try Elasto
Blasting the rustling flag on
the wall. Nothing?! Tokyo Tom
will slip and fall from the
rafters, and automatically
declares you the winner for
whatever reason. Hey, you've
completed the Goonin Trials!

Now that your charged-up Elasto
Blast (the Master Blast) can
crack crystals, you can return
to Callmigh Bluff! Not only
that, but Bo and the three
Goonins have been recruited as
crew members! I updated my crew
so it consisted of Jailcat,
Tokyo Tom, and Baron Blubba.

Save your game and leave town.
Despite your father's orders, I
think this is a great time to
finish off Mt. Krakatroda. We
don't have much else to do
there, so lets get it out of the
way while we're here.


================================
 4.20] MT. KRAKATRODA           
================================

 Slimes: Goobrielle, Pebbles

From the train tracks at the
start of the level, head up the
stairs on the left to reach your
first crystal wall. Unleash a
Master Blast to blow the thing
to smithereens. Follow the trail
to the next screen.

Approach the large hill ahead of
you and slide down. Rocket will
hit a bump at the bottom of the
slope and gyrate at an insane
speed, shooting right up the
ramp in front of you. Once you
reach the top, you can control
Rocket in his ball form. This is
called Rollerdashing. While
you're in this form, you can
destroy piggy banks, like the
one in front of you. If there is
nothing to break, press and hold
B to revert to your normal self.

Smash the piggy bank to reveal a
load of Gold and a lucky bag
(which contains a random item).
Also free Goobrielle from the
slime chest next to the piggy
bank, and use the chimaera wings
scattered around the area to
send the goods back to town. In
order to access the exits to
this area, we must Rollerdash
again.

Return to the entrance of the
area by Rollerdashing again.
Rollerdash to the left; control
Rocket so he navigates up the
ramp on the left and press B to
stop once you reach the top.
Open the chests here; one
contains a Seed of Life! Lower
the rope down for easy access,
then go back up and continue
west.

We haven't fought in a tank
battle for a lil' while, so I
s'pose now is the perfect time
for one. Well, you don't really
have much choice if you want to
rescue all the slimes, eh?


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: T-Rax | HP: 320 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Tony Two-Tails (Two-taile
 Ammo: Iron Arrow, BS-1 Crooze, 

The T-Rax is equipped with a
giant axe that can destroy any
ammo that gets in its way.
During the battle, the axe will
rise and fall down in a swinging
motion. It can be used to
destroy both your and the the
enemy's ammo. When the axe is
aimed straight ahead, focus your
ammo into the upper cannon, and
vice versa for when the axe is
aimed high in the air.

The Cactiball crew members will
often shoot themselves into
their cannons. If their own axe
doesn't stop them in their
tracks, you will have to do the
job yourself. I recommend not
wasting any ammo on them; when
the baddy reaches your tank,
stand in the artillery room and
wait for them to land. Follow
their shadow so they land right
on top of you and toss 'em right
back into a cannon.

The T-Rax does have some nasty
ammo at its disposal, like BS-2
Blue Streaks and irritaballs.
I'm sure your new crew members
may be of some assistance. Bo
and Tokyo Tom are great ammo
gatherers, but remember that
they give the ammo to you
instead of loading it in
themselves. You can use Gooshido
to even steal their ammo! Like
the Pyramaniac, the T-Rax has a
forked engine room. This time
however, take the bottom path to
reach the engine.

+-------------------------------

Pebbles will be freed after the
successful tank battle. Return
to the previous area. Rollerdash
down the slope and ride up the
hill to the right and into the
cave up ahead. You'll reach a
portion of the Mt. Krakatroda
ruins that were inaccesible
before, though there really
isn't anything of major use
aside from some random items and
Gold.

We can find a second piggy bank
that contains a lucky bag (which
always contains the very
valuable mirror shield), but
reaching it is quite the chore.
When Rollerdashing, nothing can
stop Rocket unless he hits a
piggy bank or thousandweight.
With this in mind, you have to
practically Rollerdash across
the entire level to reach the
piggy bank!

Return to where the first piggy
bank was and face the southern
hill. You have to cross several
screens to get to the piggy
bank. In terms of screens, this
is the direction you must
follow:

- south
- east
- east
- north
- east
- north

Once you reach the final screen,
roll up the stairs to reach the
piggy bank past a group of jars.
Reaching the piggy bank while
still Rollerdashing can be
tricky, but practice and consult
to your in-game map for further
assistance.

There's nothing else left to do
here in Mt. Krakatroda, so hitch
a train back to town. You will
also receive a cloaking device
for successfully completing the
level. At Boingburg, do the
usual by upgrading your tank and
fixing really anything you'd
like. Your main destination is
Callmigh Bluff, so proceed there
when you are ready.


================================
 4.21] CALLMIGH BLUFF           
================================

 Slimes: Jewelian, Mrs. Hooly, M
  Bob, Patch, Morrie-Morrie, Fla

Test out your Master Blast on
the crystal wall just to the
right of the entrance. Continue
to the next area to find three
slime chests. Open them to
rescue Jewlian, Mrs. Hooly, and
Mr. Hooly. Return to the
previous area and go north; send
the slimes back to Boingburg.

Proceed north again for a second
crystal wall. Smash it apart and
free Teeny from his prison; send
him to town. Continue through
the level until you reach level
2 of the mountain. Master Blast
the crystal wall and head on
through. Take down the
Mischievous Moles and move to
the next area. Tank battle!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Splatypanzer
| HP: 350 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Beakface (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Fire Water, Iron Shield, 

The Splatypanzer fights a
defensive battle. It has plenty
of defensive weapons in stock,
such as iron shields and
boomerangs. The crew often uses
an iron shield followed by some
BS-2 Blue Streaks. Counterattack
with your own iron shields or
mirror shields. You can also
just use a slew of ammo to block
incoming attacks.

Make sure to block the BS-2 Blue
Streaks at all costs, since they
deal a large amount of damage
with each hit. Have crew members
that man the cannons, such as
Wyrtle or Baron Blubba. You can
also use a Jailcat to infiltrate
the enemy tank or Gooshido to
steal ammo.

If you have a cloaking device,
you can storm the enemy tank
yourself. If you take out the
crew members, they won't have
time to use their pesky weapons.
The Living Statues are the
worst, because you have to
charge up a Master Blast to
defeat them. Overall, not too
difficult of a battle.

+-------------------------------

After rescuing Splodgy Dave,
head to the location of the next
crystal wall. It happens to be
on level 3, so ascend the
mountain as soon as possible.
Once on the outside ledge of
level, break down the crystal
wall in the southeast corner.
Pass by the train tracks to the
upcoming tank battle arena.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Cactiballistix |
HP: 400 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Spike (Two-tailed Cactiba
 Ammo: Golden Arrow, BS-1 Crooze

Cactiballs like to take a page
out of your book and try to
infiltrate your own tank. If
Baron Blubba is on your team,
let him guard the tank doors and
keep any infiltrators out. They
usually try to get into your
tank through the cannons, so
you'll have to use your own ammo
to stop them. Frankly, you can
let the Cactiballs enter your
artillery room, then
automatically chuck them into
your own cannon.

The Cactiballistix has some
strong artillery. The golden
arrows are incredibly fast while
the irritaballs are slow and
powerful. If you would like to
steal ammo or infiltrate the
enemy position, that's fine.
However, this battle is so easy
that you really don't have to.

Since the Cactiball crew members
spend most of their time trying
to sneak in, the enemy tank
doesn't get many shots in at
all. Since Spike is basically
manning the tank by himself,
it's easy to overwhelm the
enemy. When you reach the engine
room of the Cactiballistix, take
the upper path for victory.

+-------------------------------

After freeing Spot, return to
the mountain. From level 3, take
the left exit. Follow it to the
area where you freed Rocket's
parents. Smash through the
crystal walls and climb up the
rope ladder (the chests here
contain nothing of real value).
Go south.

Smash the crystal wall directly
to your left and proceed to the
next tank battle arena. Gosh,
there are plenty of these here!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Pyramaniac |
HP: 370 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Ninny Hammer (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Obelisk, Spooklear Bomb, 

Similar to the previous battle
against this tank, don't be
fooled by its low HP. Spooklear
bombs are incredibly annoying
weapons that can only be blocked
by holy water. You may not have
many (or any), so go entirely on
the offensive in this battle.
Don't even bother infiltrating
and devote all of your time to
attacking the enemy.

A big plus is that while you
cannot defend against spooklear
bombs, that also means that
spooklear bombs cannot defend
against your own ammo. This will
be a big-hitting battle, and it
basically comes to who can dish
out the most damage the fastest.
Again, use the upper path in the
engine room.

+-------------------------------

You will rescue Fangummy Bob
after the win. Your next
destination is the fifth level
of Callmigh Bluff. Go back
inside the mountain and head
north.

Upon reaching the fifth level of
the mountain, go inside and free
Patch. Climb the rope to reach
the mountain's peak! Enter the
portal to prevent ever having to
duplicate this agonizing trek.
While you're at it, ship Patch
home.

Return to the top of the
mountain and go north. Open the
treasure chest next to the
thousandweight for a Seed of
Life! Continue east for a tank
battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Enforker |
HP: 430 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Warren Beasty (Two-tailed
 Ammo: Lightning Staff, Iron Shi

The Enforker has some nasty
weapons at its disposal. The
hell scythes can bypass the
intended trajectory and
automatically connect with the
enemy tank, resulting in a nasty
hit. Lightning staves do not
physically hit your tank;
instead they land in your
artillery room, summoning
lightning bolts to collide with
your tank.

Lightning staves are your
biggest target here. They can
summon multiple bolts of
lightning, each dealing 40
damage. If one lands in your
tank, Elasto Blast it to
oblivion. Warren Beasty often
tosses them behind iron shields
to ensure that they land in your
tank.

The easiest way to win the
battle is to let The Enforker
beat itself. Simply knocking a
lightning staff over will
activate it. If you infiltrate
the tank and Elasto Blast a
lightning staff, you'll set it
off as the lightning bolts
targets the enemy. Knock them
out of the hands of the crew to
set off multiple staves. Even
better: let a crew member do it
themself while you load up the
cannons yourself. Take the
bottom path in the engine room
to reach the engine.

+-------------------------------

After freeing Morrie-Morrie,
return to the mountain peak and
stand in the middle of the area.
Slide down the giant rope to the
very bottom of the mountain.
You'll be given access to
another doorway; head inside.

Defeat the Walking Corpses that
rise from the grave (lol Altered
Beast) and go to the next area.
Activate the wing portal before
proceeding to the boss room.


+--------------------+
| BOSS: Harvest Loon |
+--------------------+----------

Harvest Loon emerges from the
shadows and challenges you to a
fight, but not before giving you
a slime knight. Coincidentally,
you have to use the slime knight
to do battle with this boss.

To begin the battle, Harvest
Loon floats back and forth
before lobbing a trio of small
scythes. Slash at them with your
slime knight to send them back
at the boss, damaging it. Repeat
this a few times until Harvest
Loon throws his signature scythe
at you. It will cruise along the
ledge you're standing on; slash
at it several times to send it
back the boss's way.

The strategy will repeat over
again: the boss throws a trio of
mini scythes twice, then follows
it up with his big one. When
Harvest Loon is down to one-
third of his health left, he
will start to summon Specters.
As they try to cut you, smack
them away and follow the boss as
he hurls more scythes your way.
Send them back and continue the
assault until he goes down.

+-------------------------------

After the big win, take Harvest
Loon's scythe with you to the
next room. Free Flabbot
Flancisco and bring him with you
into the teleporter. Rocket
receives a vulcan gun for
rescuing all slimes in Callmigh
Bluff.


================================
 4.22] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

After a well-needed rest, head
outside and talk with the
slimes. The slimes agree to
clean up the town. After a few
moments, the twon is looking
better than ever! The Goonins
give the king information about
the Plob: they have excavated
Flucifer's Necropolis in hopes
to dig up the Dark One. I don't
know who that is, but he doesn't
sound very good.

His Royal Wobbliness gives
Rocket a Seed of Life as a gift.
Before heading out to your new
destination, save your game and
update your tank ammo/crew. I
recommend adding Flabbot
Flancisco to your tank crew.


================================
 4.23] FLUCIFER'S NECROPOLIS    
================================

 Slimes: Cheruboing, Goochie, We
  Meggan, Blingaling, Lord Lard,
  Frankenslime, Her Royal Wobbli

Upon entering Flucifer's
Necropolis, move around the bend
and past the enemies to the next
screen. Up ahead is another
puzzle, where Rocket has to
match the structure of the
pillar. From top to bottom:

- Rockbomb
- Imp
- Rockbomb

However, his products run away!
The Imps carrying the Rockbombs
speed away in different
directions. Since we cannnot
continue until we catch them,
we'll have to take a quick
(okay, not so quick) detour.
Lets go to the right first. Keep
in mind that once you go across
the current, you won't be able
to get back.

Ride the current and pass by the
train cars to the next area.
This next area is a big maze
consisting of wells that lead to
an underground area. Drop down
the first well. Down here,
defeat the Dancing Flames and
take a look at the statue in the
center. Note that only one piece
of the statue is highlighted
pink. I'm sure that is
significant...

Take the central rope ladder to
reach the surface. Dive down the
next well up ahead to find
another statue. Another
highlighted piece of the statue.
Climb up the adjacent rope to
reach a dead end and a slime
chest. Rescue Cheruboing, then
backtrack to the train tracks
and send her home.

Back at the entrance of the
labyrinth, head down the first
well and take the rightmost
ladder this time. Follow the
path towards an intersection. Go
north to spot a pedestal and a
broken statue. We have to
complete a statue puzzle to open
up the exit, so maybe paying
attention to the other statues
was a good idea...

At the fork, take a right and
drop down. Again, another statue
with a pink piece. Climb up the
rope ladder here to ultimately
reach a slime chest. Free
Goochie and return to the
previous area and send him back
to Boingburg.

Now that we've explored all
areas here, we have to put the
puzzle pieces together. Note the
position of the highlighted
pieces on each of the statues.
That will tell you what position
you should order them in. From
top to bottom:

- Platypunk
- Mimic
- Imp

You can find all three of the
enemies in this area. Stand on
the pedestal in the northern
part of the sector to open the
rock gate in front of you.
Continue through.

Weeny is held captive in the
southeast corner of the area, so
free him first and foremost.
Then, pass by the train tracks
and go left for a tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Fort Knight | HP:
480 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Candy (Two-tailed Jailcat
 Ammo: Golden Arrow, Metal King 

This tank battle is certainly a
step up from previous scuffles.
The Fort Knight is home to a
load of dangerous equipment.
Metal king swords are not to be
messed with in the slightest.
Capable of inflicting 80 damage
per hit, knocking them out of
the sky is key to winning this
fight. However, this can be hard
when you factor in the Fort
Knight's edged boomerangs.

While the weapons look tempting,
don't bother infiltrating and
stealing them yourself. The only
exception is if you are in
possession of a cloaking device.
It's more important to
commandeer your own tank and
protect it from the Fort
Knight's ammunition.

As the battle nears its end,
Candy will start using mirror
shields. Since your crew members
aren't too intelligent, they
will continue loading ammo right
at the mirror shields,
ultimately sending our ammo back
at us. When the mirror shields
start flying, either order your
crew to do something else or
else you will have to
incapacitate them.

The Fort Knight has a nice
amount of HP, so this battle may
take a bit longer than normal
when paired with the fact that
its crew never stops working. If
you updated your tank before
coming to Flucifer's Necropolis,
it should be nearing 700 HP and
has updated crew members and
ammo. Flabbot Flancisco does a
good job of healing the tank and
Baron Blubba can keep Candy out
of your tank.

+-------------------------------

Wild Fang will be rescued and
you will be on your way. Once
back at the train tracks, take
the exit on the right. This area
is filled with nothing but water
rapids. Simply step onto the
current to ride to the left side
of the area; step off at the
northwest end and hop in the
well. Go through the underground
passage and free Sliminator at
the end of the path.

Head back to the rapids. Step
into the rapids to go south and
quickly step off onto the island
to the left; free Clawdia from
her chest, then return the two
slimes back to Boingburg.

Go back to where you found
Clawdia and hover over the
rapids to the island on the
right. Your goal is the gated
island just above you. The only
accessible section is the right
side of the island. From the tip
of the island, jump and float
towards the right side of the
island; you should be able to
make it.

After sliding down the well into
the underground tunnel, go
south. There is another water
current blocking your path. It's
flowing towards you, so you
won't be able to ride it.
Alternatively, jump on a train
car as it roll across the rapids
and hop off once on the other
side. In the next area, climb
the rope ladder to the surface.

This large fort is home to
several treasure chests.
Navigate the upper walkways of
the area and use the stairs to
the bottom. To reach the exit of
the area, go north from the well
and continue north to reach a
staircase. Look to the left of
the staircase to find a
concealed chest. Open it for
Seed of Life, then leave the
area.

As you reach the large clearing,
watch for Cactiballs that jump
out of the ground. Watch your
step and eradicate the entire
field of enemies. Once it is
clear, grab a Rockbomb and use
it to destroy the rock wall on
the right side of the field.

Return to the Rockbomb and
activate the wing portal. It
will bring you to the entrance
of the level and the main statue
puzzle. We have one Rockbomb in
our possession, but we still
need a second one. Hop back in
the wing portal and go through
the field and into the next
area. Ready for another tank
battle? No? Well you better get
ready!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: War Chest | HP:
500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Al Plata (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Bastard
 Streak, Clap Trap

Like a treasure chest, the War
Chest is filled with a
smorgasbord of weapons. You
still need to watch out for
powerful weapons such as the
metal king sword and bastard
swords. The gold bars are pretty
much worthless in a tank battle,
so I'm a bit confused why Al
Plata would implement them into
his arsenal.

The enemy crew works non-stop,
so you will have to match their
determination and work ethic. Or
you can slow down the enemies by
infiltrating the enemy tank and
destroying the computer panels
controlling the ammo ducts.
Don't bother stealing ammo; just
slow down the flow of enemy
weapons so they have no way to
defend yourself.

Flabbot Flancisco should keep
your tank's HP at top-notch, so
protecting your health should
not be hard to handle. Like the
tank battle against the Fort
Knight, defend against the metal
king swords and bastard swords.
Once you deplete the War Chest's
high HP count, head to the
engine room and follow the lower
path to reach the engine.

+-------------------------------

Eggbard will be freed from Al
Plata's grasp. Return to the
wing portal and warp back to the
entrance of Flucifer's
Necropolis. Take the western
rapids and ride 'em to the next
area.

Meggan is being held in the
lower right-hand corner of the
area. Free her and return her to
town. Once back here, climb the
steps at the north end. Ride the
cart across the track. It's a
very winding track that
eventually leads to the left
side of the area.

Opt out on returning back to
town; before entering the next
area, face the northern end of
the rapids. There is a small
alcove in the center of the
rapids that we must reach. Ride
the rapids and as you are
passive the alcove, jump onto
dry land. Open the two chests
here to free Blingaling and Lord
Lard, then head back to the
previous area and send 'em to
Boingburg.

Ride the cart to the next screen
again. The exit to the right
leads to another tank battle, so
why not head there first?


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Golemator |
HP: 530 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Digits (Two-tailed Mischi
 Ammo: Boomerang, BS-1 Crooze, B

The Golemator's crew members are
all about attacking you head-on.
The Wyrtles are used as
ammunition: they are shot out of
cannons and can damage you for
around 30 points of damage. You
need to hit them three times to
knock 'em out of the air, so ask
yourself if it's really worth it
to waste that much ammo on them.
Flabbot Flancisco should keep
your HP in check anyways.

The Wyrtles only use the lower
cannon, so I recommend that you
direct most -- if not all -- of
your ammo into the upper cannon.
Only use mirror shields in the
lower cannon so you can direct
the Wyrtle back at the sender.
All of your other ammo can be
channeled through the upper
cannon to ensure a few hits.

Like you could of figured, The
Golemator has more HP than
previous tanks you have beaten.
You'll have to work extra hard
to deplete the enemy's health,
and your crew members may have
their hands full with the
Dancing Flame that never stops
in sneaking into your tank.
Either take the enemy out
yourself or leave it to your
crew members.

+-------------------------------

After freeing Pamby, return to
the last screen and go north.
Follow the path and jump from
platform to platform. If you
fall in the rapids, you'll be
washed back to the beginning of
the area.

At the midway point, rescue
Michelle and continue hopping
across platforms. You'll have to
float to reach some of the later
platforms. Once on the other
side, open the chest to find
Tickles and load both slimes on
the train back to Boingburg.

Notice the cannon cars rolling
across the track? You must use
the cannon car to fire yourself
across the rapids in front of
you towards the well on the
other side. Once at the well,
slide on down. Free Soapia and
throw her on the train car, then
continue through the tunnel as
it takes you to a fort.

If you couldn't tell, you are
actually on the lower section of
the fort from before. However,
the path is more straightforward
than before: simply walk north
to the exit.

As you can see, this field is a
mirror image of the one from
earlier on. Like before,
activate the wing portal. Defeat
the Cactiballs lurking in the
field and use the Rockbomb to
destroy the rock wall up ahead.
Go through for another tank
battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: War Chest | HP:
500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Wingo (Two-tailed Platypu
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Edged Boomer

The crew leader even admits that
the War Chest's supply is
seriously lacking. He uses his
Ghost lackeys to enter the
Schleiman Tank and steal your
items. Set your crew members to
defend your position and protect
your tank from the pesky Ghosts.

The Ghosts can float right
through the front door and turn
invisible, so consult to the
tank map in the northwest corner
of the screen at all times. If
you see pieces of your ammo
floating in midair, it clearly
means that it's being horded by
an invisible Ghost. Either
defeat it or toss it into your
own cannon to send it back right
where it belongs!

Once you defeat the Ghosts, take
that gap of time to unload all
of your ammo at the War Chest.
Also order your crew to help you
so you can overwhelm the enemies
while the Ghosts are being
resurrected. The battle really
is not that challenging at all,
so this is one of the more
joyous tank battles since you
won't have to act as frantic.

+-------------------------------

You will rescue Frankenslime
after defeating the War Chest.
Now that we have the two
Rockbombs in our possession, we
can activate the statue puzzle!

Grab the first Rockbomb and jump
through the portal, then grab
the Imp. Hop through the second
portal and get the second
Rockbomb. From there, return to
the entrance to open the gate.

Up ahead is another field filled
to the brim with Cactiballs.
Watch where you step as you
cross the clearing to another
portal. Jump on inside to reach
a secret grove! Proceed east to
confront our buddy Slival again.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 550 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Bastard Sword, Metal King

Like all encounters with the
Schwarzman Tank, this is an
incredibly dangerous battle. Not
only do you need to watch out
for metal king swords and mirror
shields, Slival also introduces
metal king shields to the mix.
You must hit this upgraded
shield five times to take it
down!

It is essential to distract
Slival from loading his cannons,
but doing it yourself is too
dangerous. If you still have a
Jailcat or Tokyo Tom to storm
the enemy tank themselves while
you can continue to load your
cannons. If the Jailcat is on
your team, you can sneak in for
a few seconds just to steal some
ammo or destroying Slival's ammo
ducts.

As you already know from past
battles with this tank, it's
easy to distract a one-man crew.
If you have a chimaera wing with
you in the tank, use it on one
of your crew members so Slival
can get double-teamed. Keep
pestering Slival and using your
own cannons to eventually end
this battle.

+-------------------------------

Rocket will rescue Her Royal
Wobbliness after the tank battle
against Slival. Go back to the
last screen and head through the
boss door.


+--------------------+
| BOSS: Lickety Spit |
+--------------------+----------

Lickety Spit is a hulking
monster that cannot be targeted
directly. To damage him, you
must throw Cactiballs on his
long tongue. There are four
Cactiballs in the arena at all
times; if you defeat one,
another one will automatically
take its place.

Watch out for the Cactiballs'
spike attacks and dodge them
when they leap in the air with
this spikes outstretched. Also,
don't touch Lickety Spit's
tongue or he'll eat you up
instead! As Lickety Spit gets
hurt by a Cactiball and spits it
out, stand under its shadow to
catch it as it plummets to the
ground. Then you can toss the
enemy right back on the boss's
tongue!

After depleting most of Lickety
Spit's health, he will attack
with two of his vine arms. When
you see the sand underneath you
become disturbed, run away from
that spot before you are
attacked by the thorny vines.
The two vines will also spin
around, so basically retreat far
away when you see the vines.
Continue attacking Lickety
Spit's tongue to win this easy
battle.

+-------------------------------

Open the slime chest at the end
of the trail to free Lord Roly,
then enter the swirling
teleporter. You will earn an
additional prize of a meteorite
for rescuing all the slimes in
Flucifer's Necropolis.


================================
 4.24] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

The Plob have succeeded in
digging up the Dark One, so
we'll have to change our plans.
We have to infiltrate the Plob's
airship: the Flying Clawtress.
The king gives Rocket yet
another Seed of Life before
sending you off. As always,
upgrade your tank, save, and do
the essentials before leaving
town.


================================
 4.25] FLYING CLAWTRESS         
================================

 Slimes: Roboglop, Curator, Claw
  Sliborg, Flopsy, Count Calorie

Leap onto the anchor and climb
on up to the Flying Clawtress,
ala Super Mario Bros. 3.
Immediately free Roboglop and
send him on his way via the
rocket cart situated on the
left. Enter the airship.

Continue down the hall to find
yet another slime chest. Open it
to find Curator, then send him
back to town. Return to this
location and move ahead to find
a locked gate. To open it,
destroy the six computer panels
on the sides of the wall to open
it. Head through.

Rocket will find a golem lying
right in front of him. No one is
manning the machine, so hop in
for yourself. Press B to punch
and A to exit the vehicle. Go
south and defeat the Jinksters,
then break the computer panels
to open up the exit.

The spiked floors in this next
room would pose a threat for
Rocket, but the golem can tread
right over them (in fact, it
destroys the spikes!). Continue
forward to encounter another
golem. Trade blows with it until
one of them falls. If that
happens to be you, then Elasto
Blast the golem to make the
driver evacuate.

Once that happens, take it for
yourself and destroy the giant
crates on the right side of the
room. With the path opened up,
head to the following room. This
spot here also happens to be
filled with crates, so rid the
entire room of them. You will
find a few chimaera wings here
as well, which can be used to
transport the golems back to
Boingburg.

Once the room has been emptied
of crates and enemies, activate
the portal in the bottom left-
hand corner of the room.
Continue through the airship to
find a slime chest to the west
in the next area. Free Clawrence
and ship him back to town.
Return to his whereabouts and go
north to find a lone chest in
the corner; open it for a Seed
of Life.

Head to the west side of the
room to find another large gate.
You will have to destroy the
computer panels on the north and
south end of the room to open
the huge gate. Dispose of the
Restless Armours first (Master
Blast them to make them drop
their shield) and open up the
exit.

Agree to fight the Restless
Armour in a tank battle here.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Argonaut |
HP: 600 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Arm Arnie (Two-tailed Res
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Bastard Swor

The Argonaut is another tough
baddie to start off the string
of tank battles here in the
Flying Clawtress. Needless to
say, your main worry is the BS-3
Slimahwaks that Arm Arnie has in
his possession. He can load
these items quickly since he can
carry up to three items at a
time.

Send in an infiltrator or do the
job yourself, because you're
going to want some of those BS-3
Slimahawks. Use chimaera wings
to teleport crew members to the
innards of The Argonaut
immediately. You will have to be
moving back and forth throughout
your tank as you load your
cannons.

The Argonaut wields an axe
similar to the T-Rax, and it'll
occasionally swing it in a
downwards motion to destroy any
weapons in its path -- including
the opponent's ammo. Try to time
your attacks so they don't get
creamed by The Argonaut's axe.
Your arsenal of mirror shield
and iron shields should get the
job done against the enemy.

+-------------------------------

Bouncer will be freed
afterwards, and the gateway will
be opened. In the next area,
proceed across the walway and
open the chest to find Flan
Spinel. Send him home (along
with the numerous enemies here)
and move along.

A Platypunk will sick one of his
Killing Machines on you in the
next room. The game makes a big
deal out of it, but honestly,
this thing isn't much of a
threat. After a few Elasto
Blasts, the battle will end and
the exit will open on up. Up
ahead is another tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: DQ: Swordz | HP:
620 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Rusty (Two-tailed Restles
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K

The key to winning this battle
is to keep the Killing Machines
at bay. All three will try to
sabotage your tank, so put a
stop to 'em before they get a
chance. As you saw first-hand,
Killing Machines can take quite
a few hits. Instead of trying to
kill them each, simply toss them
into your cannon and use 'em as
cannon fodder.

While the Killing Machines are
off trying to kill you, Rusty
will have his hands full manning
the tank by himself. Send an
infiltrator in to distract him;
giving you the edge in this
challenging battle. Use Rusty's
metal king swords and metal king
shields against him. This tank
battle may come down to the
wire, but just remember that the
fight's not over until the
engine is destroyed.

+-------------------------------

Viscount Viscous will be sent
home and the exit will open. In
the next room, grab the slime
knight and use it to destroy all
of the computer panels inside.
Once the gate is opened, head
through (activate the portal
too) into the next room.

Hop over the spiked floor and
follow the trail of platforms to
a golem. Defeat the hulking
brute, then hop inside and use
it to destroy the crates just
south of your position. Free
Sliborg and send him home on the
rocket cart right next to you.
Hop back inside the golem and
break the crates on the far
right end of the room. Take the
exit and engage in your third
tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Daemolition Man |
HP: 650 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Hollow Kitty (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K
 Spooklear Bomb, Hell Scythe, St

This battle is awfully similar
to the previous fight aside from
the ammo known as kaboomamite.
This dangerous weapon will
result in a huge explosion when
it comes in contact with pretty
much anything. The explosion is
so big that it can take out ammo
nearby. When it's being fired,
counterattack it and hope that
the blast can take out other
enemy ammo nearby.

Alternatively, the kaboomamite
blasts may also destroy ammo of
your own as well. This dangerous
ammo is best left in the hands
of Hollow Kitty and should not
be stolen for your own use.
However, the metal king swords
and metal king shields are all
game. Basically, it comes down
to this: use the same exact
strategy that you used to win
the last tank battle here.

+-------------------------------

Flopsy will be saved after
defeating Daemolition Man.
Activate the wing portal up
ahead and move on. Rocket is up
against a whole slew of Killing
Machines at the entrance to the
boss room. Even though you're
facing off against large
numbers, it isn't too hard to
defeat all of them. Move to the
boss room after.

Before facing off with the
Plobfather, Don Clawleone,
Rocket must battle Slival one
more time. Follow him to the
tank battle stand and do what
you must.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 750 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K

C'mon, how many times have we
fought Slival before? The battle
stays pretty much unchanged
aside from the fact that hew now
uses kafrizzles. These fast
balls of energy can set your
artillery room on fire if they
connect, which can cause some
major problems.

Aside from that, have your crew
storm Slival's tank and badger
him. Once he is distracted, load
up your cannons for a few easy
hits. You can also steal his
metal king swords and metal king
shields. Flabbot Flancisco
should keep the Schleiman Tank's
HP up to par, so surviving
really isn't a major problem
here. Of course, you really have
nothing to worry about in this
tank battle.

+-------------------------------

After defeating Slival, you will
free Count Calories as well as
receive the key to Don
Clawleone's room. When you feel
ready, open the door and head on
through to confront the leader
of the Plob!


+---------------------+
| BOSS: Don Clawleone |
+---------------------+---------

This battle is actually somewhat
tough, which may be shocking
when you keep in mind the nature
of this game. The don will sit
in his throne the entire first
portion of the battle, using
traps and sicking his goons on
you.

When he pulls a remote out of
his pocket and presses a button,
buzzsaws will emerge from the
wall and fly to the other side
of the room. Jump and hover as
one passes to avoid taking
damage. The buzzsaws are
arranged in different patterns
so you will have to time your
jumps accordingly.

Next, a group of Platypunks
appear out of nowhere and attack
with tommyguns. The Platypunks
only stand in the top center of
the screen and fire downward, so
stand on either side of the
group to avoid the gunfire
entirely. Stand next to the
group and Elasto Blast straight
through to eliminate them.

Don Clawleone will also summon a
wave of miniature Platypunks.
These critters do not hurt
Rocket, but slow him down
considerably and take away his
ability to jump when they leap
on top of him. Fling them off
with an Elasto Blast before the
buzzsaws come roaring across the
room.

There is a small window between
each of the attacks, so use that
time to hit Don Clawleone with
an Elasto Blast. Once you manage
to deplete half of the boss's
health, he will change into a
giant mechanical dragon. Don
Dragone!

Surprisingly, the don's dragon
form is much easier to contend
with than his normal form. He
will quickly slither around the
perimeter of the room; you
cannot even get hurt if he moves
through you, which is weird.
When Don Clawleone stops, he
will breathe a stream of fire in
the direction his head is
facing. Move to either side of
his head and give him an Elasto
Blast.

Once the boss is nearing death,
his fire attack will now move in
an arc. All you must do to avoid
getting burnt is to hover jump
over the flame as it reaches
you. Continue attacking the side
of Don Clawleone's head to
eventually win the battle.

+-------------------------------

After the fight, Princess
Gluttonella storms in with a
strange flute. In a shocking
move, she actually opts NOT to
eat it and instead plays the
flute, much to Don Clawleone's
disapproval. By blowing the
flute, the princess
inadvertantly freed the Dark
One: Flucifer!

Flucifer enslaves the don's body
and attempts to destroy
Slimenia. Even Slival returns to
bury the hatchet (for the time
being) and teams with Rocket to
put an end this demon. After the
scene, your brand new tank faces
off against Flucifer's own
draconic tank!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Flucifer | HP:
1500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Flucifer
 Ammo: Meteorite, Kafrizzle, Red

An unobtainable weapon, the red
drill, is used quite often by
Flucifer. This weapon is very
similar to the secret weapon
used by Carrot Top. If it
connects with the Gott Schleiman
(your new tank), it will bore
into the artillery room and deal
over a hundred damage. They only
take one hit to be destroyed, so
this is the one weapon that you
need to pay extra attention to.

Slival is a great crew member.
He is incredibly quick and can
carry up to three items on his
head. He will load both cannons,
but still doesn't have the
intelligence to use items
strategically. He replaces your
other crew members as well, so
it's just you and him against
Flucifer.

Despite being high up in the
sky, you can actually infiltrate
Flucifer's tank! However, there
is no reason to for several
reasons. First off, the
possessed Don Clawleone does not
load the tank himself. He will
stand next to the front door and
attack you while you try to
break it down.

Second, the tank actually loads
the ammo into the cannon on its
own! The ammo ducts load the
ammo right into the cannon at a
very quick pace. You cannot
destroy the ammo ducts either,
nor can you steal ammo from
Flucifer. In conclusion, trying
to sabotage the enemy will just
come and screw you over in the
long run.

Flucifer's tank has a lot of
health, but your new tank has
1000 HP of its own. You will
still have the same ammunition
as you did before. Use mirror
shields to reflect the ultra-
fast meteorites back at Flucifer
and block the red drills with
iron shields and metal king
shields.

Unfortunately for you, Flucifer
has one last trick under his
sleeve. Once he calls you
something along the lines of an
"eyesore" and says "begone",
he'll begin to use his ultimate
attack. The tank's dragon mouth
will begin charging a giant red
ball.

There is no way to avoid this
attack; after a minute or so
later, a massive laser beam will
connect with your tank, dealing
incredibly high points of
damage. If your tank is already
down to zero HP, then you don't
really have to worry about this
devastating attack.

Don't worry if Flucifer depletes
your HP down to zero. In fact, I
found it a lot easier to win the
battle this way. When your
tank's health runs out, Flucifer
sends Don Clawleone over to your
tank to infiltrate the engine
room.

His tank also stops attacking
your own, so he has no way of
blocking incoming attacks! All
you have to do is avoid the
don's fire ring attack and
defeat him while Slival loads
the tank for some free hits.
While Don Clawleone is being
resurrected, join Slival in
loading up the cannons for more
freebies.

Once you drain Flucifer's tank
of its HP, the race begins. When
the time comes, bolt over to the
enemy tank and make a beeline
for the engine room. Don
Clawleone will defend his tank
before he tries to destroy your
own, so you'll seal the deal
just by entering Flucifer's
tank.

Slival joins you and helps take
out the don while you locate the
engine room. It's a
straightforward path, but
there's a lot of electrical
piping that you must destroy.
Make your slow descent into the
engine room and destroy the
glowing orb to win this
monumental battle!

+-------------------------------

Woo, the Dark One is down for
the count and the princess is
back! You'll also obtain an
orichalslime for rescuing all
slimes in the Flying Clawtress.


================================
 4.26] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

Once back in Boingburg after
rescuing all 100 slimes, speak
with His Royal Wobbliness for
the ending cinematic. Congrats
on beating the game!

As you could probably tell, the
game isn't over just yet despite
rescuing all 100 slimes. There
are a few side jobs we can
complete now that Flucifer has
been destroyed.

- Recruit Big Daddy and Mama Mia
- Explore the Hero's Well
- Find Slival
- Defeat the final tank master i
- Participate in the Tank Master

While we are here, lets recruit
your parents. After the credits
roll, talk to Big Daddy to learn
of his back problems. It can
only be cured with the rare
special medicine.

There are two main ways to get
special medicine: combine three
strong medicine with nine
goddess statues with alchemy.
You can also fight the Jinksters
in the Flying Clawtress; they
often drop goody bags containing
special medicine.

Once you have the medicine in
your possession, talk to Big
Daddy to cure him. He, as well
as Mama Mia, will join your tank
crew! They are some of the best
crew members in the game, so
definitely add them to your
team.

For now, lets head back to the
Flying Clawtress.


================================
 4.27] FLYING CLAWTRESS         
================================

 Slimes: None

You should know your way around
here, and the portals make
traversing a whole lot easier.
Return to the area where you
fought Slival (just before the
boss room) to find another tank
master.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: S. Cargo | HP:
800 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Twenty Cent (Two-tailed P
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Bastard

Keep in mind that you have the
Schleiman Tank again after
defeating the final boss of the
game. So you're back to having
the same old tank and the same
old crew. I figured an optional
end-of-game opponent like this
would put up more of a fight,
but he really doesn't. You
should be able to easily
overcome the S. Cargo and its
crew.

The three Dancing Flames will
constantly try to get inside
your tank. If your crew consists
of Baron Blubba, tell him to
keep them out. Your infiltrator
will also distract the three
enemies as he goes between the
two tanks. I've seen my Jailcat
fighting with the Dancing Flames
in the field between the two
tanks many a times.

S. Cargo has some fairly
formidable weapons, but you've
already beaten the game and
experienced the worst. The tank
only has 800 HP and should not
match your own. You should
really treat this like any other
tank battle, because that's
exactly what this is.

+-------------------------------

After the fight, Rocket will
receive a BS-3 Slimahawk. Nice!
You can also defeat Flucifer a
second time to earn the
meteorite and kafrizzle recipes.
Another good deal! Head on back
to Boingburg if you must, but
next up is Mt. Krakatroda in the
search for Slival.


================================
 4.28] MT. KRAKATRODA           
================================

 Slimes: Slival

Return to the far east section
of Mt. Krakatroda -- the same
place where you first fought
Slival -- to find your rival
again. Challenge him to one
final tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 3000 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Mirror Shield, Meteorite,

No, that's not a typo on the HP
count. Slival has really
prepared for this tank battle,
and the condition of his tank
and ammo certainly reflects
that. His artillery now mostly
consists of meteorites, which
are ultra fast and very deadly.
Slival often loads them in
threes.

There are often periods of time
where the entire screen is
filled with ammo headed towards
your tank, but there are also
long droughts that can occur for
a couple minutes. Use this
opportunity to send out your
strongest weapons to attack the
Schwarzman Tank.

This battle can be laughably
easy if you updated your crew
and ammo. I decided to go with
Flabbot Flancisco, Big Daddy,
and Mama Mia. Big Daddy is a
monster when it comes to
infiltrating tanks and attacking
crew members, so he should keep
Slival in check the entire
duration of the tank battle. I
went the entire battle without
having to resurrect Big Daddy
once!

Mama Mia is another huge key to
winning this battle. Command her
to use her "Mum Missile" attack.
While Slival is preoccupied with
your father, send a few iron
shields out of your cannon. Once
they are about halfway across
the screen, toss your mom in the
cannon. Her Mum Missile attack
ranges from 375- 750 damage in
one pop!

Slival may beat you in terms of
HP, but you should have no
trouble depleting his tank's
health. Mum Missile is the main
key to winning, because she
returns to your tank immediately
after use, ready to go again.
With Big Daddy badgering Slival,
he won't even see her coming.

+-------------------------------

You'll earn a piece of
orichalslime for defeating
Slival. Head back home.


================================
 4.29] BOINGBURG                
================================

 Slimes: None

Once back at Boingburg, head to
the west side of town and hop
inside the well that was
previously blocked by a 100St
ball.

In the Hero's Well, Rocket must
complete the task of defeating a
mirage of the Dark One. You must
attack the mirage as your
friends walk around. As the boss
attacks with waves of fire,
simply Elasto Blast into him for
some damage. This boss is just
like attacking Don Clawleone in
the tank battle against
Flucifer, so you should be
familiar with how to defeat it.

After destroying the mirage and
protecting your friends, Rocket
will be given a hero sword as a
prize. This is the best weapon
in the game, so immediately add
it to your ammo cache!

Really, the only other thing to
do in the game is to complete
the Tank Masters Tournament. If
you need help, head over to
Section 5.

________________________________

 5] TANK MASTERS TOURNAMENT     
________________________________

After rescuing Morrie-Morrie and
at least 55 other slimes, you
will be given access to the Tank
Masters Tournament. The
tournament includes four ranks,
each featuring three battles.
Completing this tournament is
quite a task!

Also keep in mind that you can
select from a number of tanks in
the Tank Masters Tournament.
Some tanks have special
abilities, such as T-Rax's axe
and Carrot Top's drill attack.
Even picking what tank you use
could affect the outcome of a
tank battle.


================================
 5.1] RANK C                    
================================

 Prize: Metal King Sword


+-------------------------------
| PRIMA BATTAGLIA: Platypanzer |
HP: 500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Wiseguy (Two-tailed Platy
 Ammo: Bastard Sword, Steel Broa

Since this is the very first
battle of the Tank Masters
Tournament, you can't expect
much difficulty. The ammo is a
strange assortment, ranging from
laughably bad pompoms to bastard
swords and mirror shields. You
shouldn't have to worry about
taking much damage from the
Platypanzer's weapons, so just
keep an eye out for those mirror
shields.

Wiseguy only has one crew member
to help him out, so he'll
certainly have his hands full
when your infiltrator arrives on
the scene. Overwhelm the tank
with your powerful ammunition
and by the time you finish the
battle, Wiseguy and his
Platypunk friend won't even know
what hit 'em.


+-------------------------------
| SECONDA BATTAGLIA: The
Trailblazer | HP: 550 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Dracken Garth (Two-tailed
 Ammo: BS-2 Blue Streak, Spookle

The Trailblazer may not be as
much of a joke as the
Platypanzer, but it is still a
fairly big pushover. The hell
scythes and BS-2 Blue Streaks
are two nasty weapons, but they
do not deal that much damage.
Your tank should have plenty of
HP and Flabbot Flancisco should
be healing your tank at every
turn, so health isn't an issue
here.

The Hammerhood can get very
annoying if you choose to
infiltrate the enemy tank and
tear it up. He gets into a fit
of rage and attacks anyone
nearby, so make sure to take him
out quickly. Sometimes the
Hammerhood will try to barge
into your tank, so either way
you will probably have to deal
with him once in this fight.
With that said, The Trailblazer
should go down quickly
regardless.


+-------------------------------
| GRAN FINALE: The Purrsecutor |
HP: 650 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Paws Button (Two-tailed J
 Ammo: BS-2 Blue Streak, Metal K
 Miracle Sword, Toy Slime

The Purrsecutor is a very
annoying foe for me, because I
hate having to deal with
Jailcats. Since they can leap
over your front door in a jiff,
command your crew to keep
baddies out (like Big Daddy).
Even though the enemy's tank has
a lot of good ammunition to use
for yourself, try to stay in
your own tank for protection.

Continue killing the weak
Jailcats and loading your cannon
once they are waiting to be
resurrected. Remember to use
various shields in the front of
your ammunition to protect the
stronger pieces that are being
sent out. It's an annoying
battle yes, but not too
difficult especially if you have
beaten the game already.


================================
 5.2] RANK B                    
================================

 Prize: Orichalcum


+-------------------------------
| PRIMA BATTAGLIA: Carrot Top |
HP: 680 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Ann Gorer (Two-tailed Bun
 Ammo: Golden Arrow, Lightning S
 Hell Scythe

The first battle of Rank B may
give you some trouble. Ann Gorer
uses a lot of ammunition at
once, mainly because the three
Platypunks stay loyal to their
leader and don't waste time
trying to infiltrate your own
tank or anything of the sort.
You will probably be seeing a
lot of golden arrows during this
battle; they seem to be her
favorite.

Aside from the ammunition, the
Carrot Top also uses the "Death
Carrot" attack. A good idea
would be for you to use the
Carrot Top tank as well; when
Ann Gorer uses her secret
weapon, use it yourself by
Elasto Blasting the big red
button on the west side of the
tank. The two attacks will
nullify each other.


+-------------------------------
| SECONDA BATTAGLIA: The
Golemator | HP: 720 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Barb Eric (Two-tailed Cac
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Destructibal

Yep, that's it. It's an
interesting concept, but this
battle is probably the easiest
fight you have ever been in.
Don't bother infiltrating the
tank, don't bother stealing
enemy ammunition. Just attack
the dang thing. The Wyrtle and
Living Statues are tough foes,
so leave them to Big Daddy if he
is on your team. Otherwise,
stick to manning the cannons.

Since destructiballs are
painfully slow, you have plenty
of time to use fodder to block
the attacks. Also use any
boomerangs or edged boomerangs
to knock away the iron shields.
Honestly, a tank composed of
just those two pieces of ammo
cannot be that imposing, right?
I didn't get damaged one point
by the time I destroyed The
Golemator's engine.


+-------------------------------
| GRAN FINALE: S. Cargo | HP:
880 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Plucker Duck (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: BS-3 Slimahwak, Hell Scyt
 Edged Boomerang

In the opening seconds of the
match you will realize how much
of a pain this battle will be.
Goodybags will automatically
teleport inside of your tank and
begin stealing your ammo. They
are incredibly fast and evasive,
so I found it best to let them
be. Set any of your crew members
to defend the tank and try to
attack S. Cargo with whatever
ammo you have left.

On top of that, the Killing
Machine will also enter your
tank and destroy your ammo
ducts. Eliminate it from the
competition and try focusing on
loading your cannons up. If you
want some payback, storm into
the opponent's tank and bash
their ammo ducts while the crew
is down for the count. This
battle may certainly take longer
than others if you are having to
deal with the annoying crew
members.


================================
 5.3] RANK A                    
================================

 Prize: Orichalslime


+-------------------------------
| PRIMA BATTAGLIA: The
Pyramaniac | HP: 1000 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Judge Mental (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Edged Boomerang, Destruct
 Spooklear Bomb, Medicinal Herb

This battle is a real pain,
because The Pyramaniac chooses
to fight a nearly all-defensive
battle. Its main weapons are
edged boomerangs and medicinal
herbs. Those boomerangs can take
out two weapons before soaring
off, and you will almost never
go a moment without seeing one.

Either steal some edged
boomerangs for yourself or
destroy the ammo ducts to slow
the production of weapons. Or
you can do things the hard way
and cram so much ammo that the
boomerangs don't manage to take
everything out. Again, you can
try using Carrot Top and settle
the score with its deadly drill.


+-------------------------------
| SECONDA BATTAGLIA: T-Rax | HP:
1100 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pablo Pickasso (Two-taile
 Ammo: Bastard Sword, Metal King

The Picksies and Platypunk like
to infiltrate your tank, however
they decide to raid it from the
air. If they aren't taken out by
the T-Rax's swinging axe, take
them out yourself. In fact, the
T-Rax's axe will be your main
concern in this tank battle. It
always seems to strike at the
worst possible time, so try not
to dig yourself in a hole when
it comes to loading ammo.

Sometimes he will use chilli
peppers to wreck any incoming
ammo. That, paired with the
swinging axe makes this battle
annoying. Pablo Pickasso tends
to shout out his orders, giving
you an inside scoop on his next
battle plans. If he says that
he's using the bottom cannon,
then direct all of your
offensive weapons through your
top cannon.


+-------------------------------
| GRAN FINALE: The Enforker |
HP: 1200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Demolition Digby (Two-tai
 Jinkster x2
 Ammo: Mirror Shield, Metal King
 Edged Boomerang

Jinksters will warp to your tank
and run amok, shooting fireballs
at your ammo ducts and computer
panels. They are fairly weak, so
make sure to kill them instead
of just tossing them into your
cannon. Also order your crew to
"keep baddies out" so you can
ease off of the work a lil' bit.
With the Jinksters off your
back, you can focus on your own
ammo.

Infiltrating The Enforker is a
fairly good idea. Aside from
destroying the enemy's ammo
ducts, locate the chute that
dispenses lightning staves.
Activate them to slowly sap away
The Enforker's HP. It does have
a large amount of health, so
make sure to connect with the
metal king swords and have Mama
Mia use her Mum Missile attack
non-stop.


================================
 5.4] RANK S                    
================================

 Prize: Orichalslime recipe


+-------------------------------
| PRIMA BATTAGLIA: DQ: Swordz |
HP: 1500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Helmut (Two-tailed Restle
 Ammo: Metal King Shield, Mirror
 Meteorite

The tank battles finally start
to pick up, as this fight is
actually quite difficult. Helmut
is a strategist; placing metal
king shields and mirror shields
right in front of metal king
swords. His crew members are
resilient and do their job well,
along with the occasional
infiltration mission. They are
tough enemies to deal with.

This may be one of those battles
where your tank may run out of
HP. If that is the case, have no
fear. Remember that when that
happens, the incoming fire slows
to a stop, giving you plenty of
time to deplete the enemy's
remaining health. If this
happens, set your crew to defend
the tank and race to the engine
before the enemies take out your
own.


+-------------------------------
| SECONDA BATTAGLIA: Bully
Mammoth | HP: 1600 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Paulie (Two-tailed Platyp
 Ammo: Kaboomamite, BS-2 Blue St
 Shield

Ooh, a new tank! This one looks
pretty awesome. Who doesn't love
elephants? The kaboomamites used
here can easily destroy any
nearby ammo, whether it's yours
or the enemy's. You will have to
use the opponent's kaboomamites
against them. Use your mirror
shields to deflect them back at
the tank or use fast ammo to
destroy them when they are close
enough to the Bully Mammoth to
hurt it; give the opponent a
taste of its own medicine!

Like the Carrot Top, the Bully
Mammoth can use a desparation
drill attack. It is identical to
the one used by Carrot Top, so
send all your shields to negate
it. When you aren't dealing with
ammo, Rocket will probably have
his hands full with Killing
Machines. Since they travel
through enemy cannons, wait as
they land into the artillery
room and throw 'em back to their
sender.


+-------------------------------
| CHAMPIONSHIP BATTAGLIA: The
Carnyvore | HP: 1700 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Butcher Bill (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Destructiball, Metal King
 Shield, Edged Boomerang

Two new tank models in a row?
This one looks like a carnival
on wheels! The crew's Ghosts
will often horde Rocket's tank
and steal your ammo. It always
seems to be the really good ammo
they take. Since the Ghosts are
invisible, wait for them to
actually pick up a weapon; when
you see it float in midair, take
out the Ghost.

Send Big Daddy back to your tank
and order him to protect the
area from the baddies. Also have
Mama Mia use her Mum Missile to
help put a dent in The
Carnyvore's tough exterior. Pick
either Carrot Top or Bully
Mammoth so you can use your last
resort drill attack to help chip
away at the enemy's health.
Despite it being the
championship match, I didn't
find this one too tough.


================================
 5.5] ULTIMATE RANK             
================================

 Prize: Hero Sword


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Shogun | HP:
3000 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Hooly
 Ammo: Hero Sword, Metal King Sw
 Edged Boomerang

Yep, that's right. The Ultimate
Rank is your final test at being
the best tank master in all the
land! And it's your own friend
Hooly that's manning this beast
of a tank. The Shogun wields the
most powerful of ammo, even
including Hero Swords! Remember
that these things can not only
deal 120 damage, but must be hit
three times to be destroyed.

The kafrizzle is another weapon
to watch out for. If they
connect with your tank, it'll
light your artillery room on
fire! Jump over the flames to
avoid getting burned and
dropping your load. Use mirror
shields to reflect them and hero
swords back at Hooly and his
massive tank.

I still think the best way to
defeat The Shogun is to pick
apart the tank while Hooly tries
to target your engine room. With
such a gap between the two tanks
in terms of HP, it is basically
only a matter of time before you
lose all of your HP.

If your HP is drained, continue
attacking until Hooly shows up
at your front door. Defeating
him isn't a problem, since his
basic attacks can easily be
countered. After defeating
Hooly, continue attacking his
empty tank until the process
repeats itself.

When The Shogun runs out of
health, head over to the tank.
Like in previous tank battles,
the leader will refuse to leave
his tank when you are inside. By
then, the battle has already
won. Destroy the engine and
celebrate being the top tank
master in Slimenia!

================================
 ITEMS
================================

+--------------+
| Seed of Life |
+--------------+----------------

There are 12 Seeds of Life in
the game, each one adding a
heart onto Rocket's health
meter.

1. Boingburg - walk behind the
   giant Yggdrasil tree inside
   the church to find
the hidden Seed of Life.

2. Boingburg - after rescuing
   His Royal Wobbliness, he
   gives you the Seed of
Life.

3. Boingburg - after rescuing 10
   slimes, the 10St iron ball
   next to Rocket's
house will disappear, revealing
a Seed of Life.

4. Forewood Forest - on your
   second trip to Forewood
   Forest, head to the
northern part of the level.
Search underneath the ramps to
find chests; one contains a Seed
of Life.

5. Tootinschleiman's Tomb -
   while you chase after Spine
   Les, you will come to
an area with two sand dunes on
both sides of the northern exit
(and a chest). Destroy both
dunes, then open the chest
between for a Seed of Life.

6. Backwoods - to the left of
   the locked gate is a batch of
   trees. Sneak
between them to discover a
hidden alcove with two slime
chests and another Seed of Life.

7. Mt. Krakatroda - after
   passing the Goonin Trials,
   return here and use the
Master Blast to destroy the
crystal wall just north of the
main entrance. Roll down the
ramp and right up the slope to
the left of the piggy bank. Open
the chests here to receive a
Seed of Life.

8. Callmigh Bluff - you will
   find this Seed of Life in a
   chest on the top
floor of the level, just before
the tank battle against The
Enforker.

9. Boingburg - after defeating
   Harvest Loon and saving
   Flabbot Flancisco, you
will be rewarded with another
Seed of Life from His Royal
Wobbliness.

10. Flucifer's Necropolis - upon
    reaching the east side of
    the large fort,
search under the bridge near the
stairs leading to the exit to
find a chest contianing a Seed
of Life.

11. Boingburg - after defeating
    Lickety Spit, Rocket will be
    given yet another
Seed of Life for his actions.

12. Flying Clawtress - you will
    find the final Seed of Life
    in a chest inside
the room where you first
encounter Restless Armor.

 AMMO
================================

+---------------+
| Bastard Sword |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 60         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A real survivor's sword, you w

The bastard sword is a powerful
weapon, but it is a very rare
item. Aside from lucky bags, the
only way to obtain this weapon
is through alchemy. Since it is
so hard to find, it is best used
in order to make metal king
swords.


+-----------+
| Bombshell |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 8          Buy: 40     

 Found: Tootinschleiman's Tomb

 "Your basic bit of ammo with da
 early stages of the game."

Bomshells are fairly useful ammo
early in the game, because you
can find an infinite amount in
Tootinschleiman's Tomb. They're
also one of the few pieces of
ammo you can buy in the
Boingburg item shop, but what's
the point when you can get 'em
for free?


+-----------+
| Boomerang |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 3          Buy: -      

 Found: Mt. Krakatroda

 "Chases enemy fire and brings i

The description pretty much says
it all. Boomerangs are best used
as a defensive tool; they chase
down and destroy enemy ammo,
regardless of which cannon it
was fired out of. Unfortunately,
sometimes it drifts off without
hitting anything.


+---------+
| Boulder |
+---------+---------------------

 Damage: 3          Buy: -      

 Found: Tootinschleiman's Tomb

 "Only inflicts 3 damage, and ca
 Pretty useless at least."

Yes, boulders are very useless
in this game. You'll probably
only need to use them in the
first two or three tank battle,
but after that you should have
sufficient enough ammo. The fact
that you own an unlimited supply
of boulders should show how lame
they are in combat.


+-------------+
| BS-1 Crooze |
+-------------+-----------------

 Damage: 24         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Improved version of the bombsh
 numbers."

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three BS-1 Croozes on
your head results in the
formation of a BS-2 Blue Streak.
Stacking your tank with these
missiles can be useful even if
you don't want to try and create
more powerful weapons; the BS-1
Croozes are strong on their own.


+------------------+
| BS-2 Blue Streak |
+------------------+------------

 Damage: 50         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Quite a bit more powerful than
 missile."

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three BS-2 Blue Streaks
on your head results in the
formation of a BS-3 Slimahawk.
Stacking your tank with these
missiles can be useful even if
you don't want to try and create
more powerful weapons; the BS-2
Blue Streaks are strong on their
own.


+----------------+
| BS-3 Slimahawk |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 100        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Much, much more powerful than 
 this missile!"

The BS-3 Slimahawk is one of the
best weapons in the game. Aside
from stacking three BS-2 Blue
Streaks in a tank battle, you
probably won't find these giant
missiles anywhere. You can only
get one of this ammo in the
entire game: beat S. Cargo in
the Flying Clawtress after
completing the game. While
there's only one in the game,
it's power certainly warrants a
spot in your tank.


+--------+
| Catnip |
+--------+----------------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: Forewood Forest, Tootins

 "Jailcats love these. Pick one 

The only use for catnips is to
distract enemy Jailcats. Either
put 'em in your own tank to
prevent them from attacking or
enter an enemy tank and distract
them from performing their
duties. Unless you know you're
fighting against Jailcats and
have time to prepare, do away
with these items.


+-------+
| Chest |
+-------+-----------------------

 Damage: 5          Buy: -      

 Found: Everywhere

 "This treasure chest may hold g
 plain old box."

Chests are found EVERYWHERE.
Unfortunately, they are fairly
worthless after the first stages
of the game. Since you can
easily outmatch them after the
first handful of tank battles,
keep the chests solely as
ingredients for various alchemy
recipes.


+---------------+
| Chilli Pepper |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: -          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Load this hot veggie into a ca
 fire!"

I'm dying to make a Red Hot
Chili Pepper joke here, but
nothing is coming to mind. Oh
well. When loaded into one of
the two cannons, it will erupt
in flames, acting as a giant
flamethrower. The flames not
only destroy incoming enemy
ammo, but ammo shot out from
your cannons as well. Refrain
from loading any ammunition into
the cannons while the chilli
pepper is in use.


+---------------+
| Chimaera Wing |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 8          Buy: -      

 Found: Mt. Krakatroda, Flying C

 "These wings are so eager to fl
 the air without delay!"

Chimeara wings are pretty gnarly
items. When thrown at a crew
member will automatically
transport them to the inside of
the enemy tank. It's a bummer
that you can't somehow use them
on yourself, but when paired
with crew members that have the
"infiltrate and sabotage" or
"target their commander"
abilities, chimaera wings can be
deadly.


+-----------+
| Clap Trap |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: -          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Lay this on the ground and wai
 by... Ouch!"

When placed on the ground, clap
traps will become invisible to
everyone except you. If an enemy
crew member unexpectedly steps
on the weapon, it'll clamp down
on them and in most cases, kill
them. Use clap traps to defend
your door or place them inside
an enemy tank to catch them by
surprise.


+-----------------+
| Cloaking Device |
+-----------------+-------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A strange item that makes you 
 enemy's tank!"

"The perfect way to sneak into
an enemy's tank". Exactly.
Whomever holding the cloaking
device will become invisible to
anyone and everyone. This is the
perfect infiltratin item: throw
it on and head into the enemy
tank, bypassing the door
completely. Once inside, destroy
the ammo ducts while crew
members wonder what the heck is
going on. Even steal some ammo
while you're at it!


+---------------+
| Destructiball |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 110        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Extremely heavy and extremely 
 slow."

Like the BS-3 Slimahawk, you
will only be able to find one of
these in the game. (though, you
can stack three irritaballs to
create one for the portion of
the tank battle). Unlike the
BS-3 Slimahawk, destructiballs
are extremely slow when
travelling through the air.
Throw plenty of items out before
you load the destructiball so it
has some protection.


+--------------+
| Devil's Tail |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: Flucifer's Necropolis

 "Badder than a Plob two-tailer!
 it'll be good for alchemy."

Devil's tails are completely
useless as ammo. However, they
are key ingredients for several
pieces of ammunition. Since you
can find plenty of devil's tails
in Flucifer's Necropolis, stock
up a nice amount and use them
for alchemy.


+-----------------+
| Edged Boomerang |
+-----------------+-------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Tougher version of a standard 
 fire at once."

The edged boomerang is basically
a suped-up version of the
boomerang. While it moves slower
than the boomerang, this one is
a bit more reliable and can even
track down and destroy up to
three targets.


+------------+
| Fire Water |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: -          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Throw this to fry the surround
 the enemy's tank."

In an interesting note, fire
water doesn't directly damage an
enemy tank. Instead, it creates
a ring of fire that can damage
crew members and destroy
machinery. You can either shoot
it through a cannon or sneak
into the tank and drop it on
them. When coupled with a
cloaking device, fire water can
be useful for killing crew
members or sealing off enemies
from reaching their cannons.


+--------+
| Girder |
+--------+----------------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: Mt. Krakatroda, Callmigh

 "For slimes who don't have the 
 items, you know."

While girders can be useful
ammunition early in the game,
they quickly become outdated.
Luckily, they have some other
uses. First off, girders are
useful alchemy ingredients. And
hey, they certainly net you a
nice amount of Gold when sold,
too.


+----------------+
| Goddess Statue |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 7          Buy: -      

 Found: Callmigh Bluff

 "A divine statue that has holy 
 alchemy, perhaps?"

Like girders, goddess statues
are primarly used as alchemy
ingredients. Since you find them
somewhat late in the game,
they're automatically ruled out
as ammo and can really only be
used for alchemy or sold for
Gold.


+----------+
| Gold Bar |
+----------+--------------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A valuable item like this fetc
 you don't need the gold."

A perfect example of ammo that
has much better uses than as a
weapon. Gold bars can be used to
create such weapons as golden
arrows, but hey, look at that
sell price! 10K? If you're low
on cash, sell these bad boys
when you get the chance!


+--------------+
| Golden Arrow |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 48         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A gleaming arrow of gold, and 
 too."

Golden arrows aren't as strong
as the other numbered weapons,
but they certainly have speed on
their side. This is one of the
fastest pieces of ammo in the
entire game; once you shoot it
out of your cannon, enemies will
have very little time to
counterattack. Stack three iron
arrows on your head to create a
golden arrow.


+-------------+
| Hell Scythe |
+-------------+-----------------

 Damage: 40         Buy: -      

 Found: Callmigh Bluff

 "A scary curved blade dropped b
 Callmigh Bluff."

Hell scythes are pretty neat
weapons. Only use them in the
upper cannon; they travel in a
trajectory of their own when
loaded in the top, making them
nearly impossible to block. They
also go for a pretty good price
when sold.


+------------+
| Hero Sword |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 120        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A mighty attacking weapon, tru
 massive amount of damage."

Hands down, the best weapon in
the game. You only get two of
these weapons in the game; the
first from completing the
challenge in the Hero's Well,
and the second for beating the
ultimate challenge in the Tank
Masters tournament. Not only is
the hero sword the strongest
weapon in the game, but it also
takes three hits from enemy fire
to be destroyed!


+--------------+
| Holy Crystal |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 3          Buy: -      

 Found: Flucifer's Necropolis

 "A sparkling stone that has hol
 wound really show its value?"

Holy crystals are best used in
alchemy, like the description
suggests. Collect eight of these
and eight goddess statues and
you've got yourself a nice,
shiny gold bar! Since you can
find both items in Flucifer's
Necropolis and Callmigh Bluff
respectively, making several
gold bars shouldn't bee too
difficult.


+------------+
| Holy Water |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 18         Buy: 60     

 Found: Flucifer's Necropolis

 "Water with holy powers that ca

Holy waters are actually pretty
strong early in the game, but
their main cause is destroying
spooklear bombs. These are the
only items in the game that can
destroy spooklear bombs. The
problem is that you rarely have
to deal with them, so holy water
aren't really that good.


+------------+
| Iron Arrow |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 12         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Being made of iron, this is a 
 basic wooden arrow."

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three iron arrows on
your head results in the
formation of a golden arrow. For
the most part, iron arrows do
not pack that much of a punch.
The good news is that they are
very fast weapons and almost
guarantee an easy hit when
fired.


+-----------+
| Iron Ball |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 26         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A big metal lump that's about 
 ammo you can fire!"

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three iron balls on
your head results in the
formation of an irritaball.
Overall, iron balls are
incredibly slow and while pretty
strong, don't give you a good
chance of connecting. While
creating an ultra-cool
irritaball is nice, you can
probably find better ammo
choices.


+-------------+
| Iron Shield |
+-------------+-----------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Once fired from one of your ca
 incoming enemy fire."

While iron shields are pitifully
weak on their own, their main
use is for protection. They are
used defensively and can
block/nullify up to three enemy
attacks. Fire very slow and/or
very strong weapons behind an
iron shield to increasing the
chances of it connecting.


+------------+
| Irritaball |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 55         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "This item is annoyingly slow! 
 damage when it hits."

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three irritaballs on
your head results in the
formation of a destructiball.
Since they are slow and strong,
make sure to fire this weapon in
the back of the line, preferably
behind shields or fodder so it
doesn't take any hits. You can
even create the awesome
destructiballs if you have
enough irritaballs in your ammo
cache.


+-------------+
| Kaboomamite |
+-------------+-----------------

 Damage: 10-25      Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Its blast covers a wide area, 
 does a lot of damage, too."

If a kaboomamite hits another
weapon in midair, it creates a
massive explosion, taking out
any ammo in the vicinity (even
your own). Using a kaboomamite
as a defensive tool allows you
to take out a line of enemy
ammunition. On the flipside, if
a kaboomamite hits an enemy
tank, the explosion will hit the
tank several times. Don't hold
it too long, because it's fuse
is ticking away every second it
is held!


+-----------+
| Kafrizzle |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 90         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A very dangerous item that rai
 watch out!"

Not only does the kafrizzle
connect for 90 points of damage,
but it also has the same after
effect as fire water. Once a
kafrizzle hits an enemy tank, it
will rain down fireballs on the
enemy artillery room, searing
enemies and preventing them from
loading the cannons!


+-----------------+
| Lightning Staff |
+-----------------+-------------

 Damage: 40+        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "It's so frightening, it summon
 use it on the enemy!"

Lightning staves can deal damage
without having to load them into
a cannon. Once one is in your
possession, throw it to have the
staff stick itself into the
ground. It'll then act as a
lightning rod as lightning bolts
strike its position over and
over again, dealing 40 points of
damage every time. Use a
lightning staff when
infiltrating a tank by throwing
it inside the enemy tank to
damage it over and over.


+----------------+
| Medicinal Herb |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: +20        Buy: 100    

 Found: N/A

 "Herbs that are perfect for tan
 to recover 20 HP."

When tossed into either cannon,
the medicinal herb will heal
your tank for 20 HP. It's always
nice to have one or two of these
in your ammo cache, but just
make sure that enemies don't
steal them and use 'em on their
tank instead!


+-------------------+
| Metal King Shield |
+-------------------+-----------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "The number one shield of shiel
 this!"

If you thought iron shields were
awesome, you've got to check out
these puppies. Metal king
shields have the power to block
up to FIVE enemy attacks before
going down. All you have to do
is load this item in the front
of the line, followed by your
most powerful ammo to
practically ensure a clean hit.
Keep note that metal king
shields are slow, so load them
in long before the other ammo so
they don't pass the shield when
moving through the air!


+------------------+
| Metal King Sword |
+------------------+------------

 Damage: 80         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "So called because it's as hard
 indeed!"

Metal king swords are straight
up good weapons. They aren't the
best out there, nor are they
even close to being the worst.
You should always keep some room
open for these weapons, since
they are rare. The only way to
obtain metal king swords is
through alchemy, which can be a
hassle since the recipe can be
pretty hard to fill out.


+-----------+
| Meteorite |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 70         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A super-fast flyer and a prett
 of damage."

No, it isn't the most powerful
weapon out there. However, the
meteorite may very well be the
fastest one out of the bunch.
Arguably the fastest piece of
ammo in the game, the meteorite
can smash into an enemy tank in
mere seconds after being fired.
The best part is that they
aren't even that hard to make!


+---------------+
| Miracle Sword |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 35         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A sword with holy powers that 
 damage it does to your enemy."

While the miracle sword seems
kinda lame on its own, it has
the unique ability of sapping
enemy HP. If it manages to hit
for 35 damage, it will also heal
your own tank for 35 HP. The
miracle sword is a decent enough
hitter and doubles as a
medicinal herb, so it wouldn't
hurt to take one along for the
ride.


+---------------+
| Mirror Shield |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A miraculous aid that can refl
 be warned, it'll only work once

This weapon drives people
absolutely bonkers. The mirror
shield has the ability to knock
an opponent's weapon right back
at them. This ammo is a must
later on in the game and when
participating in the Tank
Masters tournament: just imagine
knocking an enemy's hero sword
right back at them... The best
news is that you can find an
unlimited amount in the piggy
bank at Mt. Krakatroda!


+------------+
| Oaken Club |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 15         Buy: -      

 Found: Forewood Forest, Callmig

 "They carve these clubs out o' 

Oaken clubs are really only
useful in the beginning of the
game. They can be found in the
first level, Forewood Forest,
and aren't half-bad as ammo.
Since they are easily outclassed
later on, you are best off using
oaken clubs as ingredients for
alchemy late in the game.


+---------+
| Obelisk |
+---------+---------------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: Tootinschleiman's Tomb

 "It's already broken, so if you
 goodbyes!"

Obelisks look like awesome ammo
very early in the game, but
there are some risks to packing
a large number of them in your
tank. If you manage to drop an
obelisk, they will shatter into
thousands of pieces, rendering
them virtually useless. Obelisks
aren't the best choice when hit
by ammo or being attacked by
enemy crew members.


+------------+
| Orichalcum |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 30         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Metal harder than iron and ste
 item."

You can obtain an orichalcum
very early in the game by
completing the Gold Coast
Surfari minigame, and its
recommended that you do so. This
will most definitely be your
best ammo in the beginning
stages, but later on it may not
be the best choice. As an added
bonus, orichalcums are key
ingredients in some of the more
prized alchemy recipes.


+--------------+
| Orichalslime |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 40         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Looks rock hard at first glanc
 rare, this one."

Since orichalslimes are very
rare items, they are best used
for alchemy recipes. Despite
being decent offensive ammo,
they are better off left out of
your tank and instead used to
create weapons such as
kafrizzles or overdrive tablets.


+------------------+
| Overdrive Tablet |
+------------------+------------

 Damage: 8          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A strange slab with the letter
 other letter tablets."

The overdrive tablet is a key
ingredient in forming a super-
secret, mega- powerful weapon.
Stack the three letter tablets
on your head to form the word
"POW" to create the Powerful
Overdrive Weapon. This drill is
similar to the one used by
Carrot Top. It takes three hits
to be destroyed and will bore
into the enemy tank, dealing 100
damage multiple times!


+--------+
| Pompom |
+--------+----------------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: -      

 Found: Forewood Forest, Flucife

 "A fruit so red and tasty-looki
 because of it... if it's used a

I'm sorry, I don't think many
enemies will die at the hands of
a pompon. This is without a
doubt the worst ammo in the game
and should never be given the
chance of filling a slot in your
ammo cache. The pompom's only
use is that it can be used in a
few alchemy recipes.


+--------------+
| Power Tablet |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 8          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A strange slab with the letter
 letter tablets to make somethin

The power tablet is a key
ingredient in forming a super-
secret, mega-powerful weapon.
Stack the three letter tablets
on your head to form the word
"POW" to create the Powerful
Overdrive Weapon. This drill is
similar to the one used by
Carrot Top. It takes three hits
to be destroyed and will bore
into the enemy tank, dealing 100
damage multiple times!


+----------+
| Rockbomb |
+----------+--------------------

 Damage: 14         Buy: -      

 Found: Forewood Forest, Tootins
  Necropolis

 "Handle with care! Explodes whe
 really a monster."

As you can see, Rockbombs are
far from uncommon. These things
are actually living creatures
that can explode on impact,
making them very risky to use in
a tank battle. If you drop one
or it is bumped by another item
in the ammo duct, it will
explode and damage anyone
nearby. They are tempting to use
early in the game, so it may be
a risk that you want to take.
Who knows...


+----------+
| Shuriken |
+----------+--------------------

 Damage: 20         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Throwing stars once used by wa
 ninjutsu."

The shuriken is another very
quick weapon when launched from
a cannon. Shooting one out of
your cannon gives you a good
chance of damaging the enemy due
to it's overall speed. Not only
that, but shurikens are
surprisingly easy to make via
alchemy.


+--------------+
| Slime Knight |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: Mt. Krakatroda, Callmigh

 "Press the Y button with this o
 It's actually a toy for young s

The slime knight is a very
interesting weapon. While using
it as ammo may not be the best
idea in the world, it can
function as a weapon while
carrying it around. Once it's on
your head, press Y for the
knight to slice in the air with
his tiny sword. It's powerful
and quick, making it a fantastic
weapon when breaking into an
enemy tank. If used too much at
once, the slime knight will fall
asleep. If that's the case, drop
it and pick it up again.


+------------------+
| Special Medicine |
+------------------+------------

 Damage: +50        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "These herbs smell good... Oh, 
 tank's HP!"

When tossed into either cannon,
the special medicine will heal
your tank for 50 HP. It's
important to keep around three
in your tank, especially during
some of the harder tank battles,
but just make sure that enemies
don't steal them and use 'em on
their tank instead! Also, make
sure to keep one on the side to
give to Big Daddy!


+----------------+
| Spooklear Bomb |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 13         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Passes right through incoming 
 holy powers."

Ya know, these weapons sound
real good on paper. I mean,
they're almost untouchable in
battle since enemies rarely have
holy waters in their arsenal.
Unfortunately, they only deal a
measly 13 points of damage.
Spooklear bombs would be good
early in the game... but you
don't ever find them early in
the game. So... I give them a
big, fat "PASS".


+------------------+
| Steel Broadsword |
+------------------+------------

 Damage: 28         Buy: -      

 Found: Flying Clawtress

 "An extremely sharp sword made 

Steel broadswords are pretty
neat weapons found in the middle
stage of the game. You should
find a few of them at this time,
and they should hold a spot in
your tank then. Like most
weapons in this game, steel
broadswords get outclassed late
in the game and are reduced to
ingredients in alchemy.


+-----------------+
| Strong Medicine |
+-----------------+-------------

 Damage: +30        Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Concentrated medicinal herb th
 from its cannons."

When tossed into either cannon,
the strong medicine will heal
your tank for 30 HP. It's
important to keep one or two in
your tank in the middle of the
road, but just make sure that
enemies don't steal them and use
'em on their tank instead!


+----------------+
| Thousandweight |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 22         Buy: -      

 Found: Mt. Krakatroda, Callmigh

 "So heavy it can cause an earth
 get ready to rumble."

Needless to say, thousandweights
are pretty dang heavy (Rocket
must be awful strong if he can
tote them around!) and can
create a big dent in enemy
tanks. Plus, thousandweights
create a large tremor when
dropped, stunning crew members
and enemies alike while
destroying ammo such as obelisks
and Rockbombs. Don't count on
that happening often due to it's
sluggish speed.


+-----------+
| Toy Slime |
+-----------+-------------------

 Damage: 1          Buy: 200    

 Found: N/A

 "A gorgeous toy that looks just
 Boingburg shop!"

Since toy slimes offer no help
at all during tank battles, they
are to be reduced to ingredients
for alchemy recipes. In fact,
toy slimes are essential for the
creation of some cool ammo. The
only way to get them is from the
Boingburg item shop, so
hopefully you have enough Gold
at hand!


+----------------+
| Vulcan Bullets |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 40         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "These pack slightly more punch
 will fire 20 rounds."

Vulcan bullets can be loaded
into a Vulcan gun in order to
damage enemies or a tank. They
deal a total of 40 points of
damage when the entire 20-bullet
clip is depleted. If thrown
through the cannon, it will only
deal 5 points of damage, but I
think you can find better uses
for them.


+------------+
| Vulcan Gun |
+------------+------------------

 Damage: 10         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "If you chucked some Vulcan pel
 happen? Who can guess!?"

Vulcan guns add a bit of
strategy to a normal tank
battle. These guns can be placed
virtually anywhere you want.
Once bullets are added, they
will fire straight ahead,
damaging anything that gets in
the way. Vulcan guns are best
placed on the small balconies on
either side of the cannon to
directly attack the tank, but
you can place them in enemy
tanks to damage crew members.


+----------------+
| Vulcan Pellets |
+----------------+--------------

 Damage: 20         Buy: 120    

 Found: N/A

 "Chuck these into any Vulcan gu
 holds 20 rounds."

Vulcan pellets can be loaded
into a Vulcan gun in order to
damage enemies or a tank. They
deal a total of 20 points of
damage when the entire 20-bullet
clip is depleted. If thrown
through the cannon, it will only
deal 5 points of damage, but I
think you can find better uses
for them.


+---------------+
| Vulcan Shells |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 60         Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "Much more powerful than standa
 rounds per clip again."

Vulcan shells can be loaded into
a Vulcan gun in order to damage
enemies or a tank. They deal a
total of 60 points of damage
when the entire 20-bullet clip
is depleted. If thrown through
the cannon, it will only deal 5
points of damage, but I think
you can find better uses for
them.


+---------------+
| Weapon Tablet |
+---------------+---------------

 Damage: 8          Buy: -      

 Found: N/A

 "A strange slab with the letter
 tablets at once..."

The weapon tablet is a key
ingredient in forming a super-
secret, mega-powerful weapon.
Stack the three letter tablets
on your head to form the word
"POW" to create the Powerful
Overdrive Weapon. This drill is
similar to the one used by
Carrot Top. It takes three hits
to be destroyed and will bore
into the enemy tank, dealing 100
damage multiple times!

| Wooden Arrow |
+--------------+----------------

 Damage: 3          Buy: -      

 Found: Forewood Forest

 "This arrow's made of wood. (Ne

Like most numbered ammo,
stacking three wooden arrows on
your head results in the
formation of an iron arrow.
While wooden arrows are very
fast pieces of ammunition, they
are pathetically weak. Even with
the ability to create iron
arrows, there is little desire
to fill even one slot with a
wooden arrow.

 SLIMES
================================

+-------+
| Hooly |
+-------+-----------------------

 HP: 5

 Order 1: Fire self at enemy
 Order 2: Infiltrate and sabotag

Hooly is a great crew member,
especially in the beginning of
the game. Since he cannot load
ammo, Hooly will instead use
himself as a weapon, dealing 15
points of damage if connecting
with the enemy tank. However, he
is best used as an infiltrator.
He is great at killing crew
members and destroying ammo
ducts, and his high HP keeps him
attacking for quite a while.


+--------+
| Swotsy |
+--------+----------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Use the lower cannon
 Order 2: Use the upper cannon

Swotsy is actually pretty lousy.
He's great for very early tank
battles, but he has no means of
attacking or defending and loads
the cannons rather sluggishly.
Once you obtain more worthwhile
crew members, Swotsy should most
definitely be swapped out.


+-------------------+
| Mother Glooperior |
+-------------------+-----------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Keep everyone alive
 Order 2: Use the lower cannon

Mother Glooperior can heal crew
members for 2 HP every few
moments, which is pretty good if
you get turned upside-down by
infiltrators. If the baddies
stay in their tank, then stick
her on cannon duty.


+--------------+
| Baron Blubba |
+--------------+----------------

 HP: 5

 Order 1: Use the upper cannon
 Order 2: Keep baddies out

Baron Blubba is one of the best
crew members early on and
remains surprisingly helpful
late in the game as well. While
big and slow when loading
cannons, he is the only crew
member that can hold up to three
items at once. He is also great
at keeping enemy infiltrators
out of your tank with his deadly
attack and high HP.


+--------------+
| Curate Rollo |
+--------------+----------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Keep everyone alive
 Order 2: Keep me alive

Curate Rollo is mainly here to
keep everyone's health in check.
His healing spells restore all
HP, which makes him better than
Mother Glooperior right off the
bat. Second, he can follow
Rocket around with his "keep me
alive" command, constantly
healing you if you're in danger.
Curate Rollo is a good choice if
you are being attacked by
enemies or if you're the one
doing the infiltrating.


+----+
| Bo |
+----+--------------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Bring ammo
 Order 2: Follow the leader

Bo won't load the ammo into the
cannons herself, but instead
will give Rocket ammo when your
hands (well, face) are empty.
This can be better or worse than
other crew members. Like some
allies, they aren't too smart
when loading the cannon and will
throw anything they can get
their grubby hands (well, face)
on. Bo is a good choice because
she won't make those bad
decisions. On the flipside, she
is useless when you leave your
tank (but you can use her second
ability to follow you around
when you do leave).


+----------+
| Goosashi |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Goonin Ammo Strike
 Order 2: Goonin Bodyguard

Goonin Ammo Strike is a fancy
way of saying "fire like crazy".
With this command selected,
Goosashi will fire any ammo he
can find into the cannons,
possibly making himself a health
risk. Goonin Bodyguard is the
same as "follow the leader" as
well. What's neat about Goosashi
is that if you toss him into a
cannon, he can grab enemy ammo
out of midair and bring them
back to you!


+----------+
| Gooshido |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Goonin Ammo Theft
 Order 2: -

While Gooshido only has one
ability, it's a nifty one. He
will jump right into an enemy
tank and steal the nearest piece
of ammo (he can only carry one
at a time). It sounds great on
paper, but Gooshido has a hard
time choosing which ammo to take
and will usually just grab the
nearest one. It kinda sucks when
he brings back a wooden arrow as
opposed to a meteorite, but it
is still a neat ability
regardless.


+-----------+
| Tokyo Tom |
+-----------+-------------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Goonin Ammo Supply
 Order 2: Goonin Cammoflage

Like Bo, Tokyo Tom will simply
bring ammo to you with his
"Goonin Ammo Supply" order. With
"Goonin Cammoflage", he turns
into a random piece of
ammunition, then infiltrates the
enemy tank and attacks the crew
members while they wonder why
they're getting the stuffing
knocked out of them by an iron
ball. Even the name is cute! I
love me some portmanteaus.


+-------------------+
| Flabbot Flancisco |
+-------------------+-----------

 HP: 3

Order 1: Sing to repair the tank
 Order 2: -

Flabbot Flancisco is always a
lock as one of the crew members
on my team. His lone ability
allows him to slowly repair the
tank. His songs heal your tank
for around 20 HP around every
minute, making him a "must have"
in any difficult tank battle.
Unfortunately, his lack of
attacks makes him a sitting duck
if enemy infiltrators storm the
premises.


+-----------+
| Big Daddy |
+-----------+-------------------

 HP: 5

Order 1: Infiltrate and sabotage
 Order 2: Keep baddies out

Big Daddy is basically a
combination of Hooly and Baron
Blubba. The big guy can not only
keep enemies at bay with his
powerful attacks, but he can
also infiltrate and sabotage
enemy tanks with ease; he can
break down the front door of a
tank without breaking a sweat.
It's a bummer that you can only
get Big Daddy after completing
the game, but he's a great
addition when participating in
the Tank Masters tournament.


+----------+
| Mama Mia |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Mum missile

Yeah, Mama Mia is a pro at
loading the cannons with her
"fire like crazy" ability, but
her other ability is where she
shines. With her "Mum missile"
attack, she will fire herself at
an enemy tank, draining up to a
quarter of the tank's HP! It's a
bummer that you can only get
Mama Mia after completing the
game, but she's a great addition
when participating in the Tank
Masters tournament.


================================
 MONSTERS
================================

To recruit a monster as a crew
member, you must capture at
least 30 of them. Once you have
brought at least that many back
to town, enter the museum to
find a statue and the monster
itself wandering about. Talk to
the monster to recruit it as a
crew member.


+-----------+
| Platypunk |
+-----------+-------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Infiltrate and sabotag

Considering how Platypunks are
fodder in the game, one could
easily deduce that they aren't
the most well-rounded crew
member out of the bunch. While
the selection of orders is
rather nice, the Platypunk does
not perform either one rather
well. He is slow at gathering
ammo and loading them up, and
his low HP doesn't make him the
best infiltrator.


+---------+
| Jailcat |
+---------+---------------------

 HP: 3

Order 1: Infiltrate and sabotage
 Order 2: Fire like crazy

Jailcats are one of the best
infiltrators in the game. It is
able to jump right over the
front door of the tank and
surprisingly, usually destroys
the control panel to
automatically open it. As an
added bonus, Jailcats are very
common in the early stages of
the game and are easy to recruit
as crew members. Just watch out
for any sneaky enemy that has
catnip at their disposal!


+--------+
| Dracky |
+--------+----------------------

 HP: 2

 Order 1: Use the lower cannon
 Order 2: Use the upper cannon

Eh, Dracky is nothing special.
He isn't the fastest crew member
out of the bunch and has fairly
low HP, making him a target. At
least he can attack unlike some
crew members (*cough I'm looking
at you Swotsy cough*), but there
are still plenty others better
than Dracky. The only reason you
might want to use him in your
tank is if you're never around
the man the cannons yourself and
you need a lacky to pick up your
slack.


+------------------+
| Mischievous Mole |
+------------------+------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Use the lower cannon
 Order 2: Bring ammo

Similar to Bo, Mischievous Mole
will not load the cannon himself
when you have the "bring ammo"
order assigned. This prevents
him from making poor decisions,
like loading ammo in the wrong
order or tossing a Chilli Pepper
right after using a Hero Sword.
If you do want him to do things
for himself, give him the "use
the lower cannon" command.


+----------+
| Bunicorn |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 4

Order 1: Infiltrate and sabotage
 Order 2: Fire self at enemy

The Bunicorn rivals Hooly in
terms of commands, but Hooly
pulls ahead just by a hair. He
can fire himself at the enemy
tank for 15 points of damage and
travels quickly through the air,
to boot. His high HP makes
Bunicorn a good infiltrator as
well, but if you had to pick
between Bunicorn and Hooly, go
with the latter.


+--------+
| Picksy |
+--------+----------------------

 HP: 2

 Order 1: Use the lower cannon
 Order 2: Use the upper cannon

Like Swotsy and Dracky, Picksy
has the ability to load either
cannon with ammo. Unlike the
previous two, Picksy is very
quick on his feet and can chuck
items pretty far. Picksy will
attack infiltrators by throwing
items at them, but just don't
make sure he throws something
valuable like kaboomamite!


+------------+
| Hammerhood |
+------------+------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Target their commander

Hammerhood is great at what he
does. His strong arms allows him
to carry up to two items as he
excels in manning the cannons
when you're away. His "target
their commander" ability can
also be used when you are
infiltrating an enemy attack,
since Hammerhood is a tough foe
to contend with. If he loses his
hammer in a fight, he'll go
berserk and whack people left
and right!


+----------+
| Goodybag |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 5

 Order 1: Steal ammo
 Order 2: -

Goodybag is without a doubt, one
of the best crew members in the
game. He has high HP, incredibly
fast, and can even teleport
through walls and objects!
Goodybag is the best ammo thief
in the game and will have one
piece of ammunition back to your
tank in a flash. The only
downside is that they are
extremely rare enemies, and
catching 30 is a real chore.
It's not such a bad idea to take
the extra effort in recruiting
one.


+-------+
| Mimic |
+-------+-----------------------

 HP: 4

 Order 1: Fetch ammo
 Order 2: Mimic a chest

The Mimic has no trouble
grabbing ammo and giving it to
Rocket when he is fresh out.
Like others with the same
command, he doesn't load the
cannons himself and strays away
from making potentially harmful
decisions. However, the Mimic's
"mimic a chest" technique leaves
much to be desired. The Mimic
will sneak into an enemy tank,
disguise itself as a chest, and
attack when enemies get close.
You are probably better off just
sending a regular infiltrator
instead.


+-----------+
| Cactiball |
+-----------+-------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Target their commander

The Cactiball are all-around
crew member to use in a tank
battle. He isn't the best at
attacking the commanding enemy,
but he certainly aren't the
worst. Granted, he only has
average HP and may get killed
often. If you were to use a
Cactiball in your crew, I'd
stick with the "fire like crazy"
order.


+-------+
| Ghost |
+-------+-----------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Steal ammo
 Order 2: Hamper their commander

Another fantastic ammo thief.
The Ghost floats through walls
completely invisible as it
steals ammo from the enemy. His
"hamper their commander" order
directly takes the ammo out of
the commander's hands, which
would also prevent an incoming
attack. Goodybags are better
item thieves overall, but many
take the Ghost instead since
they are much easier to recruit.


+-----+
| Imp |
+-----+-------------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Fetch ammo

The Imp is a totally crazy crew
member. He's very wacky and
sporadic, which could ultimately
aid to his downfall. Sometimes
he will trip and fall down,
dropping anything in his hands.
This can be disastrous if he was
holding Rockbombs or
kaboomamites. The Imp is a
decent crew member, but you'd
have to live with the risks if
you use him in your tank.


+--------+
| Wyrtle |
+--------+----------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Use the upper cannon
 Order 2: Fire self at enemy

Wyrtle probably isn't the best
choice to man the upper cannon.
He can only carry one item and
is VERY slow. However, he's a
damn fine weapon himself. When
using the "fire self at enemy"
command, Wyrtle will soar
through the air towards the
enemy tank. Not only can he deal
30 damage to the tank, but it
takes three hits to send him
crashing to the ground.


+---------------+
| Living Statue |
+---------------+---------------

 HP: 2

 Order 1: Use the lower cannon
 Order 2: Keep baddies out

While he may have low HP, most
enemies cannot even destroy a
Living Statue due to their tough
exterior. Unfortunately, they
ARE statues after all. Most
enemies will walk right past him
without getting touched, and
needless to say, the Living
Statue is a poor cannon user.


+----------------+
| Walking Corpse |
+----------------+--------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: -

Another useless crew member. The
Walking Corpse is painfully
slow, which is baffling why he'd
be given a command such as "fire
like crazy". The only plus in
the Walking Corpse's resume is
that he instantly respawns after
being defeated, but face it, he
probably won't be in the middle
of any firefights.


+---------------+
| Dancing Flame |
+---------------+---------------

 HP: 3

Order 1: Infiltrate and sabotage
 Order 2: Guard your commander

The Dancing Flame is another
good infiltrator. While only
possessing decent HP, he has a
long-range flame attack that is
powerful in its own right. He
can also guard the commander,
which doubles as an infiltration
buddy if you want to hijack the
enemy tank yourself.


+----------+
| Jinkster |
+----------+--------------------

 HP: 3

 Order 1: Fire like crazy
 Order 2: Infiltrate and sabotag

Well hey, yet another good
infiltrator! We're on a roll
here. The Jinkster, while weak
and not that strong, can
teleport directly to the enemy
tank, breaking computer panels
and opening the front door for
any other allies to storm in.
Jinksters are not the best
cannon loaders, so stick to
having them attack the enemy
tank.


+-----------------+
| Restless Armour |
+-----------------+-------------

 HP: 3

Order 1: Infiltrate and sabotage
 Order 2: Guard your commander

The Restless Armour can actually
perform both tasks well. While
he is kinda clunky, he serves
more of a distraction to enemies
than a real threat, which is
still useful. Also, the Restless
Armour is great at protecting
Rocket since he puts that shield
of his to use when against
enemies.


+-----------------+
| Killing Machine |
+-----------------+-------------

 HP: 6

 Order 1: Use the upper cannon
 Order 2: Target their commander

My my, look at that HP! The
Killing Machine is a powerhouse
that can decimate crew members
if ordered to. He is
surprisingly quick on his feet
and has both a short and a long-
range attack. His laser beam
attack will target the commander
himself, but often sweeps from
side to side and may hit other
crew members or control panels.
He's also a darn good ammo
loader. The Killing Machine
should be a shoe-in for your
crew.


+-------+
| Golem |
+-------+-----------------------

 HP: 7

 Order 1: Wait for me
 Order 2: -

The Golem is... interesting to
say the least. Like in the main
story, he functions more as an
item/vehicle. All he does is sit
there and wait for you to jump
in. Once you do, you can
infiltrate and destroy a tank in
a flash. The Golem is a good
choice if you tend to do things
yourself in terms of
infiltrating and destroying
enemy tanks. Just don't leave
him unattended, because enemies
can use him as well!

================================
 10.2] BOSSES                   
================================

+--------------------+
| BOSS: Bough Beater |
+--------------------+----------

This boss is incredibly easy.
The menacing tree known as Bough
Beater will run sideways around
the small arena. All you have to
do to attack him is to Elasto
Blast into his body. He is
incredibly slow, but will attack
with his arms once you hit him.
Bough Beater extends his lanky
arms, so run to either side to
avoid his appendages.

Once he loses half of his
health, Bough Beater will move
much faster, in addition to
turning purple. Leaves will fall
to the ground, but I do not see
what the point of it is. Now as
you hit him with an Elasto
Blast, the leaves on his head
will crumble. Hit him with an
Elasto Blast several more times
and avoid his arms to win this
simple battle.


+-----------------+
| BOSS: Pot Belly |
+-----------------+-------------

Ah, another incredibly simple
boss. The first of the Plob's
Big Three, Pot Belly will use
the mystical Krak Pot to create
random items, ranging from
chimaera wings to bananas. The
only way to hurt, and
subsequently defeat, Pot Belly
is by using his items against
him.

Pot Belly will throw rocks (???)
in the Krak Pot, then runs
around as it spews items out
into the air. If it happens to
be Rockbombs or fire water, keep
away from the giant explosions
that are created when they fall
to the ground. If he pulls
bananas out, avoid the banana
peels that are left so you don't
slip.

When Pot Belly pulls chimaera
wings out of the Krak Pot, grab
as many as you can. Once he
finally stops, toss one at him.
The only thing keeping the wings
from transporting the big lug to
Boingburg is the ceiling. He
will fly upwards and slam into
the ceiling, losing a bit of his
health.

The battle doesn't really get
any harder. Occasionally
medicinal herbs are the product
of the Krak Pot, in which you
can use them to heal yourself.
Most of the time Pot Belly will
hurt himself by slipping on
banana peels or getting hit by
Rockbombs, so you don't really
have to worry about much in this
fight.


+--------------------+
| BOSS: Harvest Loon |
+--------------------+----------

Harvest Loon emerges from the
shadows and challenges you to a
fight, but not before giving you
a slime knight. Coincidentally,
you have to use the slime knight
to do battle with this boss.

To begin the battle, Harvest
Loon floats back and forth
before lobbing a trio of small
scythes. Slash at them with your
slime knight to send them back
at the boss, damaging it. Repeat
this a few times until Harvest
Loon throws his signature scythe
at you. It will cruise along the
ledge you're standing on; slash
at it several times to send it
back the boss's way.

The strategy will repeat over
again: the boss throws a trio of
mini scythes twice, then follows
it up with his big one. When
Harvest Loon is down to one-
third of his health left, he
will start to summon Specters.
As they try to cut you, smack
them away and follow the boss as
he hurls more scythes your way.
Send them back and continue the
assault until he goes down.


+--------------------+
| BOSS: Lickety Spit |
+--------------------+----------

Lickety Spit is a hulking
monster that cannot be targeted
directly. To damage him, you
must throw Cactiballs on his
long tongue. There are four
Cactiballs in the arena at all
times; if you defeat one,
another one will automatically
take its place.

Watch out for the Cactiballs'
spike attacks and dodge them
when they leap in the air with
this spikes outstretched. Also,
don't touch Lickety Spit's
tongue or he'll eat you up
instead! As Lickety Spit gets
hurt by a Cactiball and spits it
out, stand under its shadow to
catch it as it plummets to the
ground. Then you can toss the
enemy right back on the boss's
tongue!

After depleting most of Lickety
Spit's health, he will attack
with two of his vine arms. When
you see the sand underneath you
become disturbed, run away from
that spot before you are
attacked by the thorny vines.
The two vines will also spin
around, so basically retreat far
away when you see the vines.
Continue attacking Lickety
Spit's tongue to win this easy
battle.


+---------------------+
| BOSS: Don Clawleone |
+---------------------+---------

This battle is actually somewhat
tough, which may be shocking
when you keep in mind the nature
of this game. The don will sit
in his throne the entire first
portion of the battle, using
traps and sicking his goons on
you.

When he pulls a remote out of
his pocket and presses a button,
buzzsaws will emerge from the
wall and fly to the other side
of the room. Jump and hover as
one passes to avoid taking
damage. The buzzsaws are
arranged in different patterns
so you will have to time your
jumps accordingly.

Next, a group of Platypunks
appear out of nowhere and attack
with tommyguns. The Platypunks
only stand in the top center of
the screen and fire downward, so
stand on either side of the
group to avoid the gunfire
entirely. Stand next to the
group and Elasto Blast straight
through to eliminate them.

Don Clawleone will also summon a
wave of miniature Platypunks.
These critters do not hurt
Rocket, but slow him down
considerably and take away his
ability to jump when they leap
on top of him. Fling them off
with an Elasto Blast before the
buzzsaws come roaring across the
room.

There is a small window between
each of the attacks, so use that
time to hit Don Clawleone with
an Elasto Blast. Once you manage
to deplete half of the boss's
health, he will change into a
giant mechanical dragon. Don
Dragone!

Surprisingly, the don's dragon
form is much easier to contend
with than his normal form. He
will quickly slither around the
perimeter of the room; you
cannot even get hurt if he moves
through you, which is weird.
When Don Clawleone stops, he
will breathe a stream of fire in
the direction his head is
facing. Move to either side of
his head and give him an Elasto
Blast.

Once the boss is nearing death,
his fire attack will now move in
an arc. All you must do to avoid
getting burnt is to hover jump
over the flame as it reaches
you. Continue attacking the side
of Don Clawleone's head to
eventually win the battle.


================================
 10.3] TANK BATTLES             
================================

+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Platypanzer |
HP: 50 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Websy (Two-tailed Platypu
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb

Your tutorial should have proved
useful when it comes to your
very first tank battle. Unlike
the mountain of course, The
Platypanzer fights back.
Nevertheless, Ducktor Cid will
still give you some basic
pointers before the fight
begins. The battle is painfully
simple even for your first one
since Websy, the leader, only
uses the top cannon. If you see
a projectile coming your way,
throw a boulder in the top
cannon to negate the attack.

Your tank only holds boulders
and bombshells. Since bombshells
are stronger than boulders, use
them in the bottom cannon to
ensure a perfect hit. Use your
large supply of boulders on the
top cannon to block any incoming
attack, and tossing the others
in the bottom cannon to speed
the fight up in your favor. Just
watch out for the extra-powerful
Rockbombs.

The Platypanzer only has 50 HP,
so you should have little
trouble here. Websy fires at a
fairly slow rate, so you could
probably throw most of your ammo
in the bottom cannon, using one
or two in the top when needed.
The key to winning any tank
battle is to never stop moving.

Remember: the fight doesn't end
when the opposing tank loses all
it's HP. Once you deplete every
last bit of it, you will have to
infiltrate the tank. Exit your
tank and bounce over to The
Platypanzer. Make a beeline to
the engine room, which is
straight ahead from the
entrance.

The engine room is guarded by a
trio of electrical pipes (the
number increases drastically in
later battles). Elasto Blasting
works fine, but doing so can be
a little on the slow side. I
often grab ammunition from
inside the tank to use against
the pipes. Once you are smack
dab in front of the heart-shaped
engine, Elasto Blast into it to
destroy The Platypanzer and win
the battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Platypanzer |
HP: 60 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Feathers (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb

We happen to be fighting The
Platypanzer again, so some
aspects of this battle will be
the same as the last. The ammo
is the same as before, but now
both cannons will be used due to
an increase in crew members. Now
you will really have to stay on
your toes and use both cannons
in effort of negating enemy
attacks. Try to use the top and
bottom cannon equally.

Your new ammo should be pretty
useful here. The Platypanzer
still has a relatively low
amount of HP, and Rockbombs and
obelisks work wonders here.
Using those two ammunitions can
be risky, since you cannot
afford dropping either one when
loading up the ammo (the
obelisks break and the
Rockbombs, of course, explode).
Stocking up your tank with those
two items can be a little risky,
but all it really means is that
you have to be extra careful.

Since there's more than one
opposing crew member, you face
the risk of being infiltrated.
Spine Les will often try to
enter your tank and sabotage it
(enemies can successfully
destroy your ammo ducts by
destroying the computer panels
on the walls).

When you spot Spine Les on the
top screen trying to enter your
tank, either knock him around
until he is killed (he'll then
revive back inside his own tank)
or hurl him in your cannon to
send his spiny butt back where
he belongs. He can even shoot
himself out of his own cannon to
successfully land in your own
tank! Of course, you can
infiltrate enemy tanks as well,
but doing so is not recommended
until you get your own crew
members.

The Platypanzer stands no chance
against your bombshells,
Rockbombs, and obelisks. Despite
doubling their crew, you should
have little trouble draining
their HP. Once the tank is
crippled, run over to the enemy
tank and destroy the engine
room. One of the crew members,
if not both, will try to stop
you, so destroy them and blast
the engine to win the tank
battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Short Shooter |
HP: 70 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pickles (Two-tailed Picks
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Bombshell, 

Just by looking at the HP and
the ammo, this tank battle may
seem tougher than the rest. In
fact, it's quite possibly the
easiest one yet. Pickles, for
whatever reason, announces which
cannon he will be depositing his
ammo in. He is no liar, so pay
attention to his comments.

If he uses the bottom cannon,
dispense nearly all of your ammo
into the bottom cannon to
neutralize his attacks. Every
once in a while, when the coast
is clear, shoot one or two of
your stronger ammo in the top
cannon to ensure a direct hit
(like your orichalcum or
Rockbombs). If he switches to
the top cannon, flip your
strategy so you direct most of
your fire to the top cannon.

Sometimes Pickles will shoot
himself out of one of the
cannons. If you see this happen,
shoot him down and quickly throw
all of your ammo into the
cannons to attack Short Shooter
while the leader crashes to the
floor. This is one of the easier
tank battles, so it should end
rather quickly. Remember to go
and break the engine once Short
Shooter runs out of HP.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Purrsecutor |
HP: 100 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pyjamas (Two-tailed Jailc
 Ammo: Bombshell, Obelisk, Rockb

This is most definitely your
toughest battle yet. The
Purrsecutor rivals the Schleiman
Tank on nearly every level: HP,
ammo, and crew members. It has
some wicked ammo that can really
put a dent in your armor. You'll
certainly have to be on your
toes when fighting against this
opponent.

If possible, try to use your
weaker ammo as fodder (boulders,
chests) while using your
stronger weapons to actually
damage the enemy tank
(orichalcum, Rockbombs).
Remember that you can cycle
through objects that you are
carrying by pressing R; you
throw the bottom one first.

The Jailcat always tries to
infiltrate your tank, so you
will often have to fend it off
while simultaneously attacking
The Purrsecutor. You most likely
don't have any catnips as
distraction, so kill it instead.
The Jailcat will come back for
more after death, but at least
you have an opening to attack
while it is being resurrected.

Sometimes Pyjamas will also try
to directly attack your tank as
well. While this seems like a
pain, it also means that no one
is manning their tank. Use this
opportunity to load as much ammo
into your cannons as possible.
Cycle back and forth between
killing crew members and loading
ammo into the cannons until the
tank is destroyed. From there,
hurry up and take out the
engine.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Golemator |
HP: 150 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Duckles (Two-tailed Platy
 Ammo: Boulder, Rockbomb, Bombsh

This is a doozy of a fight.
Hopefully you upgraded the
Schleiman Tank's HP to around
190, because you'll need the
durability when going up against
weapons such as iron balls.
These things can deal 26 points
of damage, so make it your first
priority to knock them out of
the sky before they can connect.

Don't worry if you have to go
into a defensive stance in this
battle, because Cactiballs will
also try to attack your tank
from the inside. Worrying about
three crew members can be a
hassle, so try to take them out
quickly. Having one of your ammo
ducts destroyed can be a huge
handicap in this tank battle.
Either kill the Cactiballs or
use them as ammo.

If you tend to be in a bit of a
stalemate (it's not uncommon),
try infiltrating The Golemator
and destroying one of their ammo
ducts or crew members. Entering
from the ground may take a while
since you have to destroy the
door, and shooting through the
sky is risky because you may
collide with ammunition and fall
to the ground. Choose either
strategy, then damage the tank
from the inside.

Don't panic if your tank reaches
0 HP. You can still man the
cannons even with a banged-up
tank, so the battle isn't over
if you run out of HP. Just guard
the doors and eliminate any
enemy that tries to enter. Once
you deplete the enemy tank's HP
as well, ditch the Schleiman
Tank and head to their engine
room. The crew members will stay
and defend their own tank
instead of targeting your engine
room, so you'll pretty much be
in the clear.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Purrsecutor |
HP: 180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Boiglar (Two-tailed Jailc
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Oaken Club,

Before you do anything at all,
press Start to assign commands
to your crew. Luckily, crew
members in this game are pretty
competant. This battle should
actually be fairly easy
considering you have three very
good crew members.

I personally had Hooly, Swotsy,
and Baron Blubba as my crew.
Swotsy and Blubba manned the
lower and upper cannons
respectively, while Hooly
infiltrated the enemy tank and
tore it to shreds. They rarely
slack off, so these two do a
pretty good job at attacking The
Purrsecutor on their own. Plus,
Hooly will be distracting the
enemy crew, giving them little
time to attack (or defend).

Since the cannons are covered,
you do not really have to focus
on them yourselves. Instead, hop
into a cannon yourself and fire
yourself into The Purrsecutor.
Help out Hooly by attacking the
Jailcats and destroying their
ammo ducts. From here, just wait
until your crew destroys The
Purrsecutor on their own. Since
you're already inside, scamper
off to the engine room and
finish the job.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Crono Twigger |
HP: 150 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Guaca Moly (Two-tailed Mi
 Ammo: Wooden Arrow, Oaken Club,

Oh lordy, pun of the century.
The Crono Twigger (I chuckle
every time I hear it) isn't much
of a threat offensively, but it
has the ability to heal itself
with the use of medicinal herbs.
When loaded into a cannon, it
will heal the tank. Of course,
you can steal these herbs from
the tank and use it on yourself
if you so desire.

This is actually a pretty easy
battle. Crono Twigger has less
than stellar HP and its ammo
isn't too threatening. Hooly can
single-handedly take care of the
entire crew over there, while
you can either help him out or
dish out the damage even faster
alongside your two other crew
members. Even with the 20 HP-
healing power of the medicinal
herbs, they are no match for
your weapons.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Carrot Top | HP:
200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Patty Puss (Two-tailed Pl
 Ammo: Iron Ball, Oaken Club, Fi

A full crew and powerful weapons
stand in front of you in this
tank battle. Dealing with a
total of four enemies can be
more difficult, so make sure to
send Hooly over to the tank to
help distract them. You should
really defend against the
ammunition, so it's not
recommended that you leave your
tank.

The Carrot Top wields some nasty
ammo as well as a "secret
weapon" of sorts. When Patty
Puss mentions "you-know-what",
get ready to guard the Schleiman
Tank. The giant drill on the
front of the Carrot Top soars
towards your tank. Fire anything
and everything out of the lower
cannon to help destroy it. If it
reaches your tank, it will bore
into the front, dealing 40
damage nearly every second! It
will be destroyed after around
10 shots from the lower cannon.

If you manage to destroy the
drill, the crew will abandon all
hope and instead charge at the
Schleiman Tank. If Baron Blubba
is on your team, order him to
keep baddies out and give him a
hand between loading up the
cannons. The three Bunicorns
should not cause much trouble if
you keep 'em in line.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Cyclown | HP:
180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Pickaro (Two-tailed Picks
 Ammo: Boomerang, Shuriken, Iron

Rescuing the extra slimes in
Forewood Forest should have
really helped you prepare for
this battle. Pickaro fights more
of a defensive battle since most
of his ammunition consists of
boomerangs, which can track down
incoming ammo and destroy it.
Your crew should be able to
handle some of the pressure
brought on by The Cyclown.

If Hooly is in your group (I
don't know why he wouldn't be),
have him storm the enemy tank.
Continue loading up your tank
cannons while he gets a head
start; you can either abandon
your post and help Hooly while
your gang continues your duty or
stick in your tank and let the
lil' guy do all the work. Either
way, the battle will be simple
enough. With Hooly distracting
the crew members, no one will be
able to defend your attacks.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Boomerang, Steel Broadswo

Don't be lured into a false
sense of security just because
Slival is the only one you have
to worry about here. I'm not
sure how, but he can load his
tank cannons up like a mutha.
He's insanely quick and stocking
his cannons and getting the ammo
out, and even Hooly will have a
hard time trying to keep Slival
at bay.

Slival definitely has some nasty
weapons. His iron shields serve
as great cover for steel
broadswords and iron arrows,
while his boomerangs will cut
down your incoming ammo in a
flash. Remember to use your
weaker ammo to nullify the enemy
ammo while saving your best
pieces for damaging Slival's
tank. Your orichalcums and BS-1
Croozes should put a real dent
into the Schwarzman Tank.

While it seems very dangerous,
infiltrating the tank yourself
is the key to winning the tank
battle with ease. By now, your
tank should have high-enough HP
to withstand a full-on assault
(around 290 HP is reasonable).
Have your crew members take
cannon duties and enter the
Schwarzman Tank with Hooly.
Attack Slival yourself while
Hooly destroys the ammo ducts.

The Schwarzman Tank has an
interesting design setup. The
back room is not accessible by
the foyer; instead you must go
through the artillery room to
reach the back room. As a
result, you can basically take
the artillery room "hostage" so
to speak. Keep attacking Slival
and don't let him enter the
room, which means he won't be
able to use the cannons. Since
he can only access it through
the foyer, you only have to
guard the southern doorway.

Since Slival literally will not
be able to attack your tank at
all, your crew members should
(slowly) do the job for you
themselves. The engine room is a
bit bigger than in previous tank
battles, so keep that in mind as
well. Also, Slival will bolt to
the engine room in pursuit, so
take the time to knock him silly
if he shows up in an effort to
stop you.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Fort Knight | HP:
180 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Dan Fango (Two-tailed Dra
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Iron Ball

After dealing with a guy like
Slival, this chump should be no
problem. The Fort Knight only
contains iron shields and iron
balls. While iron shields are
very annoying, iron balls move
pathetically slow and are an
easy target for incoming
ammunition fire. Use your weaker
ammo like bombshells to bring
down the iron shields and save
the heavy hitters to actually
hurt the Fort Knight.

Another (risky) strategy is to
completely ignore all incoming
ammo. Dan Fango usually only
uses one of the two cannons
because he likes to send out an
iron shield followed by a few
iron balls. You can try and
protect your tank or send all
your ammo towards the unguarded
cannon to ensure clean hits.

The Fort Knight has a nice
amount of HP, and all the iron
shields may prove to be a
problem in damaging the tank.
This battle may take a bit
longer than usual. I don't want
to sound like a broken record,
but infiltrating and sabotaging
an enemy tank isn't always such
a bad idea. If you want to stick
around and completely overwhelm
the enemy crew with your slew of
awesome ammo, that's fine by me.
Either way: you shouldn't have
that much difficulty in taking
down the Fort Knight.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Carrot Top | HP:
250 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Bugsy (Two-tailed Bunicor
 Ammo: Iron Arrow, Iron Ball, St

Carrot Top should not prove to
be too much of a threat, even
with its beefed- up HP. You
should have a new and improved
tank complete with new ammo and
possibly even a new crew. I was
able to swap out Swotsy with a
Jailcat, then also kept Hooly
and Baron Blubba. Have Blubba
load the upper cannon and keep
baddies out if they storm the
tank, and have the other two
infiltrate and sabotage.

Bugsy only uses three different
types of ammo, so you should
know how to defend against each
one. Your own tank should be
chuck full o' iron shields and
other goodies, so this tank
battle should be a breeze
overall. If you hear Bugsy
command the crew to use the
Death Carrot, toss an iron
shield and some other weak ammo
through the lower cannon to
prevent it from hitting your
tank.

Once the enemy's plan is foiled,
they will charge the tank. Order
Blubba to keep baddies out and
bring Jailcat and Hooly back.
Help Blubba while the other two
fire at Carrot Top. You've
already fought Carrot Top
before, so you should be aware
of all the tricks they can pull
out of their hat.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Pyramaniac |
HP: 200 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Dracky Dan (Two-tailed Dr
 Ammo: Spooklear Bomb, Iron Ball

The Pyramaniac's artillery
consists mainly of spooklear
bombs. These weapons will pass
through all other ammo until it
connects with your tank. The
only way to negate the weapon is
by using holy water. You may
actually have some holy water in
your ammo cache (I had around
three), but even they won't be
enough to stop all the spooklear
bombs Dracky Dan has at his
disposal.

Since your ammo cannot stop
spooklear bombs, you can
actually use this to your
advantage. The Pyramaniac will
occasionally devote one cannon
to only firing spooklear bombs.
Fire all your powerful ammo the
same direction, since your ammo
will pass right through the
spooklear bombs undetected. All
that's left are iron balls and
thousandweights, which are
really slow-moving ammunition;
you should have no trouble
stopping them.

Since the Pyramaniac has low HP
and you should have at least one
infiltrator running amok over
there, this battle should not
last very long at all. The
Walking Corpses pose little
threat when you enter the tank
yourself, so just pass them as
you bolt to the engine room.

The engine room is a little
confusing to follow, since there
are two paths to take. Ignore
the bottom path as it leads to a
dead end. Follow the upper
passage to eventually reach the
engine.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Chrono Twigger |
HP: 250 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Molone (Two-tailed Mischi
 Ammo: Oaken Club, Steel Broadsw

The Crono Twigger only has two
real pieces of ammunition: the
oaken club and steel broadsword.
Since the steel broadswords are
the more powerful of the two,
defend against them more than
the oaken clubs. By now, your
crew members and deadly ammo
should be enough to take care of
this tank. It does use strong
medicines every once in a while,
which heals tht tank for 30 HP.

You should breeze through this
tank battle. Aside from the
occasional Mischievous Mole that
tries to break into your tank,
the Crono Twigger poses little
threat to the Schleiman Tank. It
only uses oaken clubs and steel
broadswords to attack your own,
while it will sometimes heal
itself for 30 HP with a strong
medicine.

You should be dealing more than
the tank is healing, so it won't
take long for this machine to be
destroyed. Keep in mind that
once the enemy tank reaches zero
HP, the strong medicine will
have no effect on it (meaning it
won't go from zero to 30 HP; the
item just won't do anything).


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 300 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Steel Broadsword, Iron Sh

Even though Slival says he upped
his game from before... he
really hasn't. Sure, he's
acquired some fancy new weapons,
but his fighting tactics stay
relatively unchanged. As opposed
to previous tank battles, keep
two of your crew members on
cannon duty while one
infiltrates the enemy.

Your other crew members should
load the cannons. Jailcat can
fire like crazy and Baron Blubba
can carry a nice amount of ammo
on his head. You'll need all the
help you can get fending off
hordes of steel broadswords and
pesky iron shields. Like your
last encounter with Slival, stay
on the defensive for the
majority of the battle. It's
more important conserving your
own health than depleting his
quickly.

If your infiltration strategy
worked wonders last time, don't
hesitate to try it again. Like I
said, this battle is more or
less the same ast the last one,
so you can easily keep Slival
from loading the cannons while
your crew attacks his own.

Either strategy works fine, but
be aware that this is a tough
fight; don't be alarmed if your
tank comes close to being (or
is) destroyed. Slival still
needs to destroy your engine to
win the tank battle, and Baron
Blubba is one huge obstacle to
get around!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: T-Rax | HP: 320 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Tony Two-Tails (Two-taile
 Ammo: Iron Arrow, BS-1 Crooze, 

The T-Rax is equipped with a
giant axe that can destroy any
ammo that gets in its way.
During the battle, the axe will
rise and fall down in a swinging
motion. It can be used to
destroy both your and the the
enemy's ammo. When the axe is
aimed straight ahead, focus your
ammo into the upper cannon, and
vice versa for when the axe is
aimed high in the air.

The Cactiball crew members will
often shoot themselves into
their cannons. If their own axe
doesn't stop them in their
tracks, you will have to do the
job yourself. I recommend not
wasting any ammo on them; when
the baddy reaches your tank,
stand in the artillery room and
wait for them to land. Follow
their shadow so they land right
on top of you and toss 'em right
back into a cannon.

The T-Rax does have some nasty
ammo at its disposal, like BS-2
Blue Streaks and irritaballs.
I'm sure your new crew members
may be of some assistance. Bo
and Tokyo Tom are great ammo
gatherers, but remember that
they give the ammo to you
instead of loading it in
themselves. You can use Gooshido
to even steal their ammo! Like
the Pyramaniac, the T-Rax has a
forked engine room. This time
however, take the bottom path to
reach the engine.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Splatypanzer
| HP: 350 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Beakface (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Fire Water, Iron Shield, 

The Splatypanzer fights a
defensive battle. It has plenty
of defensive weapons in stock,
such as iron shields and
boomerangs. The crew often uses
an iron shield followed by some
BS-2 Blue Streaks. Counterattack
with your own iron shields or
mirror shields. You can also
just use a slew of ammo to block
incoming attacks.

Make sure to block the BS-2 Blue
Streaks at all costs, since they
deal a large amount of damage
with each hit. Have crew members
that man the cannons, such as
Wyrtle or Baron Blubba. You can
also use a Jailcat to infiltrate
the enemy tank or Gooshido to
steal ammo.

If you have a cloaking device,
you can storm the enemy tank
yourself. If you take out the
crew members, they won't have
time to use their pesky weapons.
The Living Statues are the
worst, because you have to
charge up a Master Blast to
defeat them. Overall, not too
difficult of a battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Cactiballistix |
HP: 400 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Spike (Two-tailed Cactiba
 Ammo: Golden Arrow, BS-1 Crooze

Cactiballs like to take a page
out of your book and try to
infiltrate your own tank. If
Baron Blubba is on your team,
let him guard the tank doors and
keep any infiltrators out. They
usually try to get into your
tank through the cannons, so
you'll have to use your own ammo
to stop them. Frankly, you can
let the Cactiballs enter your
artillery room, then
automatically chuck them into
your own cannon.

The Cactiballistix has some
strong artillery. The golden
arrows are incredibly fast while
the irritaballs are slow and
powerful. If you would like to
steal ammo or infiltrate the
enemy position, that's fine.
However, this battle is so easy
that you really don't have to.

Since the Cactiball crew members
spend most of their time trying
to sneak in, the enemy tank
doesn't get many shots in at
all. Since Spike is basically
manning the tank by himself,
it's easy to overwhelm the
enemy. When you reach the engine
room of the Cactiballistix, take
the upper path for victory.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Pyramaniac |
HP: 370 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Ninny Hammer (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Obelisk, Spooklear Bomb, 

Similar to the previous battle
against this tank, don't be
fooled by its low HP. Spooklear
bombs are incredibly annoying
weapons that can only be blocked
by holy water. You may not have
many (or any), so go entirely on
the offensive in this battle.
Don't even bother infiltrating
and devote all of your time to
attacking the enemy.

A big plus is that while you
cannot defend against spooklear
bombs, that also means that
spooklear bombs cannot defend
against your own ammo. This will
be a big-hitting battle, and it
basically comes to who can dish
out the most damage the fastest.
Again, use the upper path in the
engine room.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Enforker |
HP: 430 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Warren Beasty (Two-tailed
 Ammo: Lightning Staff, Iron Shi

The Enforker has some nasty
weapons at its disposal. The
hell scythes can bypass the
intended trajectory and
automatically connect with the
enemy tank, resulting in a nasty
hit. Lightning staves do not
physically hit your tank;
instead they land in your
artillery room, summoning
lightning bolts to collide with
your tank.

Lightning staves are your
biggest target here. They can
summon multiple bolts of
lightning, each dealing 40
damage. If one lands in your
tank, Elasto Blast it to
oblivion. Warren Beasty often
tosses them behind iron shields
to ensure that they land in your
tank.

The easiest way to win the
battle is to let The Enforker
beat itself. Simply knocking a
lightning staff over will
activate it. If you infiltrate
the tank and Elasto Blast a
lightning staff, you'll set it
off as the lightning bolts
targets the enemy. Knock them
out of the hands of the crew to
set off multiple staves. Even
better: let a crew member do it
themself while you load up the
cannons yourself. Take the
bottom path in the engine room
to reach the engine.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Fort Knight | HP:
480 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Candy (Two-tailed Jailcat
 Ammo: Golden Arrow, Metal King 

This tank battle is certainly a
step up from previous scuffles.
The Fort Knight is home to a
load of dangerous equipment.
Metal king swords are not to be
messed with in the slightest.
Capable of inflicting 80 damage
per hit, knocking them out of
the sky is key to winning this
fight. However, this can be hard
when you factor in the Fort
Knight's edged boomerangs.

While the weapons look tempting,
don't bother infiltrating and
stealing them yourself. The only
exception is if you are in
possession of a cloaking device.
It's more important to
commandeer your own tank and
protect it from the Fort
Knight's ammunition.

As the battle nears its end,
Candy will start using mirror
shields. Since your crew members
aren't too intelligent, they
will continue loading ammo right
at the mirror shields,
ultimately sending our ammo back
at us. When the mirror shields
start flying, either order your
crew to do something else or
else you will have to
incapacitate them.

The Fort Knight has a nice
amount of HP, so this battle may
take a bit longer than normal
when paired with the fact that
its crew never stops working. If
you updated your tank before
coming to Flucifer's Necropolis,
it should be nearing 700 HP and
has updated crew members and
ammo. Flabbot Flancisco does a
good job of healing the tank and
Baron Blubba can keep Candy out
of your tank.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: War Chest | HP:
500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Al Plata (Two-tailed Plat
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Bastard
 Streak, Clap Trap

Like a treasure chest, the War
Chest is filled with a
smorgasbord of weapons. You
still need to watch out for
powerful weapons such as the
metal king sword and bastard
swords. The gold bars are pretty
much worthless in a tank battle,
so I'm a bit confused why Al
Plata would implement them into
his arsenal.

The enemy crew works non-stop,
so you will have to match their
determination and work ethic. Or
you can slow down the enemies by
infiltrating the enemy tank and
destroying the computer panels
controlling the ammo ducts.
Don't bother stealing ammo; just
slow down the flow of enemy
weapons so they have no way to
defend yourself.

Flabbot Flancisco should keep
your tank's HP at top-notch, so
protecting your health should
not be hard to handle. Like the
tank battle against the Fort
Knight, defend against the metal
king swords and bastard swords.
Once you deplete the War Chest's
high HP count, head to the
engine room and follow the lower
path to reach the engine.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Golemator |
HP: 530 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Digits (Two-tailed Mischi
 Ammo: Boomerang, BS-1 Crooze, B

The Golemator's crew members are
all about attacking you head-on.
The Wyrtles are used as
ammunition: they are shot out of
cannons and can damage you for
around 30 points of damage. You
need to hit them three times to
knock 'em out of the air, so ask
yourself if it's really worth it
to waste that much ammo on them.
Flabbot Flancisco should keep
your HP in check anyways.

The Wyrtles only use the lower
cannon, so I recommend that you
direct most -- if not all -- of
your ammo into the upper cannon.
Only use mirror shields in the
lower cannon so you can direct
the Wyrtle back at the sender.
All of your other ammo can be
channeled through the upper
cannon to ensure a few hits.

Like you could of figured, The
Golemator has more HP than
previous tanks you have beaten.
You'll have to work extra hard
to deplete the enemy's health,
and your crew members may have
their hands full with the
Dancing Flame that never stops
in sneaking into your tank.
Either take the enemy out
yourself or leave it to your
crew members.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: War Chest | HP:
500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Wingo (Two-tailed Platypu
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Edged Boomer

The crew leader even admits that
the War Chest's supply is
seriously lacking. He uses his
Ghost lackeys to enter the
Schleiman Tank and steal your
items. Set your crew members to
defend your position and protect
your tank from the pesky Ghosts.

The Ghosts can float right
through the front door and turn
invisible, so consult to the
tank map in the northwest corner
of the screen at all times. If
you see pieces of your ammo
floating in midair, it clearly
means that it's being horded by
an invisible Ghost. Either
defeat it or toss it into your
own cannon to send it back right
where it belongs!

Once you defeat the Ghosts, take
that gap of time to unload all
of your ammo at the War Chest.
Also order your crew to help you
so you can overwhelm the enemies
while the Ghosts are being
resurrected. The battle really
is not that challenging at all,
so this is one of the more
joyous tank battles since you
won't have to act as frantic.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 550 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Bastard Sword, Metal King

Like all encounters with the
Schwarzman Tank, this is an
incredibly dangerous battle. Not
only do you need to watch out
for metal king swords and mirror
shields, Slival also introduces
metal king shields to the mix.
You must hit this upgraded
shield five times to take it
down!

It is essential to distract
Slival from loading his cannons,
but doing it yourself is too
dangerous. If you still have a
Jailcat or Tokyo Tom to storm
the enemy tank themselves while
you can continue to load your
cannons. If the Jailcat is on
your team, you can sneak in for
a few seconds just to steal some
ammo or destroying Slival's ammo
ducts.

As you already know from past
battles with this tank, it's
easy to distract a one-man crew.
If you have a chimaera wing with
you in the tank, use it on one
of your crew members so Slival
can get double-teamed. Keep
pestering Slival and using your
own cannons to eventually end
this battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: The Argonaut |
HP: 600 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Arm Arnie (Two-tailed Res
 Ammo: Iron Shield, Bastard Swor

The Argonaut is another tough
baddie to start off the string
of tank battles here in the
Flying Clawtress. Needless to
say, your main worry is the BS-3
Slimahwaks that Arm Arnie has in
his possession. He can load
these items quickly since he can
carry up to three items at a
time.

Send in an infiltrator or do the
job yourself, because you're
going to want some of those BS-3
Slimahawks. Use chimaera wings
to teleport crew members to the
innards of The Argonaut
immediately. You will have to be
moving back and forth throughout
your tank as you load your
cannons.

The Argonaut wields an axe
similar to the T-Rax, and it'll
occasionally swing it in a
downwards motion to destroy any
weapons in its path -- including
the opponent's ammo. Try to time
your attacks so they don't get
creamed by The Argonaut's axe.
Your arsenal of mirror shield
and iron shields should get the
job done against the enemy.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: DQ: Swordz | HP:
620 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Rusty (Two-tailed Restles
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K

The key to winning this battle
is to keep the Killing Machines
at bay. All three will try to
sabotage your tank, so put a
stop to 'em before they get a
chance. As you saw first-hand,
Killing Machines can take quite
a few hits. Instead of trying to
kill them each, simply toss them
into your cannon and use 'em as
cannon fodder.

While the Killing Machines are
off trying to kill you, Rusty
will have his hands full manning
the tank by himself. Send an
infiltrator in to distract him;
giving you the edge in this
challenging battle. Use Rusty's
metal king swords and metal king
shields against him. This tank
battle may come down to the
wire, but just remember that the
fight's not over until the
engine is destroyed.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Daemolition Man |
HP: 650 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Hollow Kitty (Two-tailed 
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K
 Spooklear Bomb, Hell Scythe, St

This battle is awfully similar
to the previous fight aside from
the ammo known as kaboomamite.
This dangerous weapon will
result in a huge explosion when
it comes in contact with pretty
much anything. The explosion is
so big that it can take out ammo
nearby. When it's being fired,
counterattack it and hope that
the blast can take out other
enemy ammo nearby.

Alternatively, the kaboomamite
blasts may also destroy ammo of
your own as well. This dangerous
ammo is best left in the hands
of Hollow Kitty and should not
be stolen for your own use.
However, the metal king swords
and metal king shields are all
game. Basically, it comes down
to this: use the same exact
strategy that you used to win
the last tank battle here.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 750 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Metal K

C'mon, how many times have we
fought Slival before? The battle
stays pretty much unchanged
aside from the fact that hew now
uses kafrizzles. These fast
balls of energy can set your
artillery room on fire if they
connect, which can cause some
major problems.

Aside from that, have your crew
storm Slival's tank and badger
him. Once he is distracted, load
up your cannons for a few easy
hits. You can also steal his
metal king swords and metal king
shields. Flabbot Flancisco
should keep the Schleiman Tank's
HP up to par, so surviving
really isn't a major problem
here. Of course, you really have
nothing to worry about in this
tank battle.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Flucifer | HP:
1500 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Flucifer
 Ammo: Meteorite, Kafrizzle, Red

An unobtainable weapon, the red
drill, is used quite often by
Flucifer. This weapon is very
similar to the secret weapon
used by Carrot Top. If it
connects with the Gott Schleiman
(your new tank), it will bore
into the artillery room and deal
over a hundred damage. They only
take one hit to be destroyed, so
this is the one weapon that you
need to pay extra attention to.

Slival is a great crew member.
He is incredibly quick and can
carry up to three items on his
head. He will load both cannons,
but still doesn't have the
intelligence to use items
strategically. He replaces your
other crew members as well, so
it's just you and him against
Flucifer.

Despite being high up in the
sky, you can actually infiltrate
Flucifer's tank! However, there
is no reason to for several
reasons. First off, the
possessed Don Clawleone does not
load the tank himself. He will
stand next to the front door and
attack you while you try to
break it down.

Second, the tank actually loads
the ammo into the cannon on its
own! The ammo ducts load the
ammo right into the cannon at a
very quick pace. You cannot
destroy the ammo ducts either,
nor can you steal ammo from
Flucifer. In conclusion, trying
to sabotage the enemy will just
come and screw you over in the
long run.

Flucifer's tank has a lot of
health, but your new tank has
1000 HP of its own. You will
still have the same ammunition
as you did before. Use mirror
shields to reflect the ultra-
fast meteorites back at Flucifer
and block the red drills with
iron shields and metal king
shields.

Unfortunately for you, Flucifer
has one last trick under his
sleeve. Once he calls you
something along the lines of an
"eyesore" and says "begone",
he'll begin to use his ultimate
attack. The tank's dragon mouth
will begin charging a giant red
ball.

There is no way to avoid this
attack; after a minute or so
later, a massive laser beam will
connect with your tank, dealing
incredibly high points of
damage. If your tank is already
down to zero HP, then you don't
really have to worry about this
devastating attack.

Don't worry if Flucifer depletes
your HP down to zero. In fact, I
found it a lot easier to win the
battle this way. When your
tank's health runs out, Flucifer
sends Don Clawleone over to your
tank to infiltrate the engine
room.

His tank also stops attacking
your own, so he has no way of
blocking incoming attacks! All
you have to do is avoid the
don's fire ring attack and
defeat him while Slival loads
the tank for some free hits.
While Don Clawleone is being
resurrected, join Slival in
loading up the cannons for more
freebies.

Once you drain Flucifer's tank
of its HP, the race begins. When
the time comes, bolt over to the
enemy tank and make a beeline
for the engine room. Don
Clawleone will defend his tank
before he tries to destroy your
own, so you'll seal the deal
just by entering Flucifer's
tank.

Slival joins you and helps take
out the don while you locate the
engine room. It's a
straightforward path, but
there's a lot of electrical
piping that you must destroy.
Make your slow descent into the
engine room and destroy the
glowing orb to win this
monumental battle!


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: S. Cargo | HP:
800 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Twenty Cent (Two-tailed P
 Ammo: Metal King Sword, Bastard

Keep in mind that you have the
Schleiman Tank again after
defeating the final boss of the
game. So you're back to having
the same old tank and the same
old crew. I figured an optional
end-of-game opponent like this
would put up more of a fight,
but he really doesn't. You
should be able to easily
overcome the S. Cargo and its
crew.

The three Dancing Flames will
constantly try to get inside
your tank. If your crew consists
of Baron Blubba, tell him to
keep them out. Your infiltrator
will also distract the three
enemies as he goes between the
two tanks. I've seen my Jailcat
fighting with the Dancing Flames
in the field between the two
tanks many a times.

S. Cargo has some fairly
formidable weapons, but you've
already beaten the game and
experienced the worst. The tank
only has 800 HP and should not
match your own. You should
really treat this like any other
tank battle, because that's
exactly what this is.


+-------------------------------
| TANK BATTLE: Schwarzman Tank |
HP: 3000 |
+-------------------------------

 Crew: Slival
 Ammo: Mirror Shield, Meteorite,

No, that's not a typo on the HP
count. Slival has really
prepared for this tank battle,
and the condition of his tank
and ammo certainly reflects
that. His artillery now mostly
consists of meteorites, which
are ultra fast and very deadly.
Slival often loads them in
threes.

There are often periods of time
where the entire screen is
filled with ammo headed towards
your tank, but there are also
long droughts that can occur for
a couple minutes. Use this
opportunity to send out your
strongest weapons to attack the
Schwarzman Tank.

This battle can be laughably
easy if you updated your crew
and ammo. I decided to go with
Flabbot Flancisco, Big Daddy,
and Mama Mia. Big Daddy is a
monster when it comes to
infiltrating tanks and attacking
crew members, so he should keep
Slival in check the entire
duration of the tank battle. I
went the entire battle without
having to resurrect Big Daddy
once!

Mama Mia is another huge key to
winning this battle. Command her
to use her "Mum Missile" attack.
While Slival is preoccupied with
your father, send a few iron
shields out of your cannon. Once
they are about halfway across
the screen, toss your mom in the
cannon. Her Mum Missile attack
ranges from 375- 750 damage in
one pop!

Slival may beat you in terms of
HP, but you should have no
trouble depleting his tank's
health. Mum Missile is the main
key to winning, because she
returns to your tank immediately
after use, ready to go again.
With Big Daddy badgering Slival,
he won't even see her coming.

 11] GAME REVIEW                
________________________________

I just love those cute blue
piles of goo. They're so cute
and they were always the object
of my affection in the Dragon
Quest series. I remember hearing
about Dragon Quest Heroes:
Rocket Slime a while back, not
knowing that it was actually a
sequel of a game only released
in Japan. It looked like a
charming platformer game with a
lot of things to collect and
dungeons to crawl through.
Rocket Slime is often compared
to the old Zelda games, and I
can see where those comparisons
come from. Despite sharing
similarities to one of the
greatest video game series of
all time, Rocket Slime is more
like "Zelda for Dummies", if you
ask me.


Story The story takes place in
Boingburg, where a total of 101
slimes can blissfully carry on
with their lives. The main
character, a young slime named
Rocket, is first seen with a
couple of buddies. They "borrow"
a magical flute found in the
town castle and mess around with
it. Rocket wins a game to
determine who plays the flute.
After testing out the ol' thing,
Rocket's father storms on the
scene. In a panic, Rocket hides
the flute in his stomach,
stretching his body out. To make
a short story even shorter, an
evil organization known as the
Plob invaded Generic Town-
*ahem*, Boingburg.

For reasons unknown, the evil
platypuses (or whatever the
plural form of "platypus" is)
capture all 100 slimes. They
mistake Rocket for a worm (since
the flute stretched out his
insides) and dispose of him in a
nearby forest. First off, lets
state the good things. The story
is somewhat funny, what with
Rocket being mistaken for an
invertebrate and all. Second,
having the evil group consisting
of platypuses is unique. I mean,
platypuses rock. Then again,
this is one of the most generic
stories ever used. Uh oh, it's
time to rescue your loved ones
who have been kidnapped by bad
guys! And it's pretty stupid
that it never states WHY the
Plob decided to randomly destroy
a town and kidnap all of its
inhabitants. Well, at least you
don't find out why until the end
of the game. Overall, the story
is too generic for its own good.
Boresville.


Graphics Ah, here we go. A nice,
high point of Rocket Slime. The
graphics are for lack of a
better word, cute. The graphics
seem a bit childish, but they
are very bubbly and colorful.
The animation is real smooth and
I always smile when I see Rocket
bopping about. The enemies have
such cute reactions and
animations as well. It's real
funny to see a monster get
surprise and try to run away
while its tiny feet flail
around. In a way, the graphics
make Rocket Slime look like a
modern-day cartoon. I'm not
complaining, because I have
enough dignity to be seen while
playing this game.

Some of the bigger sprites look
really awesome. A couple of the
bosses are pretty large in size
and they look top-notch. Also,
the graphics in the tank battles
are real nice. The gigantic
tanks look very polished and
detailed. I'd say that the
graphics are used a bit better
in the tank battles than in the
regular game, but overall the
visuals in Rocket Slime are
impressive.


Controls There really isn't
anything to complain about with
the controls. Rocket's main
technique, the Elasto Blast, is
used by holding A and moving in
a direction with the D-Pad. Let
go of A and Rocket will be shot
in said direction. You can also
press A to jump in the air. When
airborne, hold A to float for a
short period of time. If you
have an object or person on your
back, you can press B to throw
them. Try throwing something
right after using an Elasto
Blast; they'll go flying!

The controls are all the same
for tank battles. When fighting
an enemy tank, the only skills
you'll be using is the Elasto
Blast and throwing. Tank battles
can be very hectic at times, so
the simplicity of the controls
helps you keep your cool when in
a sticky situation. The controls
are all easy to use, but my only
minor complaint is that not all
of the buttons are used at all
times. For example, you only use
the X button when you are using
a particular item.


Sound I can't really complain
about the sound, but it's not
perfect. Heck, most of the time
the sound in Rocket Slime isn't
even recognizable. It's hard to
notice the music in this game,
whether or not it's bad or just
dull; I can't figure it out.
Most of the music is quirky and
cute, but that is to be expected
with the game's nature. The boss
music is probably the better
tracks in the game, but
unfortunately there are very few
bosses in Rocket Slime.

The sound effects in the game
are also charming and humorous.
Rocket makes the cutest sounds
effects, it's adorable and
embarrassing at the same time. I
love the little "hup" sound that
he makes when he jumps in the
air. Slimes have an infant-like
cry when they get hit by an
enemy. The characters also have
a strange mumbling sound when
you talk to them; similar to
games like Banjo Kazooie, and
they nicely fit their
characteristics. For example,
the main antagonist, Don
Clawleone, sounds like an
obnoxious mafia leader. On the
other hand, the enemies in the
game have quite possibly the
most annoying voice in the game.
Whenever they hit, they emit an
ear-piercing squeal that is so
unpleasant to the ears, it's
just disturbing. It's sad that I
avoid hurting enemies just so I
don't have to hear their cry of
death. For the most part, the
sound and music is great, but
there are some difficulties with
it.


Gameplay First off, I wasn't
sure else where to add this, but
I need to get the humor out of
the way. Overall, DQH: Rocket
Slime is a really funny game. If
you're a fan of the Mario &
Luigi games, then you may notice
the same type of humor in this
one. Either way, you're sure to
bust a gut at some of the puns.

Unfortunately, most of the puns
are so overused that the humor
becomes forced. Many of the puns
revolve around slimes in
general. For example, you're
most likely going to hear this
line or something similar
through the game: "I gotta get
GOOing!". It's funny the first
time, but it's just plain dumb
after the eighth time over. Some
of the puns are referring to
pop-culture, such as movies or
games. One of the tanks that you
fight is a giant tree;
conveniently named "Chrono
Twigger". There are three slimes
in the game that creepily
resemble the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles, with their
appearance and traits. Many of
the jokes and references are a
nice add-in, but many of the
puns are forced into the
dialogue, making them that much
more irritating.

Like I stated earlier, DQH:
Rocket Slime is often compared
to the old 2D Zelda games in
term of gameplay. For the most
part, Rocket is sliming his way
through dungeon by dungeon,
collecting items and saving
slimes. In the beginning of the
game, that's all you do: save
slimes. Not long after saving
oh, around five slimes, you will
uncover the massive tank known
as the Schleiman Tank. After
that, you will find yourself
battling massive enemy tanks in
order to save your comrades or
access new areas.

Needless to say, tank battles
are something you'll never see
in a Zelda game. The objective
is actually quite simple:
destroy the opposing tank before
it destroys yours. With an
arsenal of 30 various weapons,
this may sound simple, but it
always isn't. Many of the tanks
require you to use a bit of
strategy in your assault. Most
of the ammo you acquire is
through collecting items across
the areas you explore. A lot of
your ammunition are regular
weapons that will deal damage to
the opponent when it makes
contact, but some are special
weapons that open up all new
strategies.

In the tank interior, there are
two cannons used for firing your
ammo. The top cannon fires any
ammo placed in it in an arc. It
will slowly travel towards the
enemy tank, which is situated on
the opposite side of the arena.
The bottom tank fires straight
ahead, and is more speedy than
the former. Ammo is found in
chutes located all around the
tank, so you will find yourself
frantically running back and
forth to find all the ammo and
firing it.

Both tanks have an HP bar, and
it will deplete with each hit of
a weapon. The interesting part
is that the battle isn't over
when a tank reaches zero HP.
When a tank runs out of HP, the
vehicle will break down and the
engine will become exposed. Your
new task is to run inside the
enemy tank, enter the engine
room, and destroy the engine
with an Elasto Blast. You will
find yourself without any HP is
some tank battles, and all you
can do is to take a stand and
defend your tank from enemy
intruders. One more small note:
you can increase your tank's HP
so you aren't always at a
disadvantage.

It sounds easy, but some tank
battles are pretty tough.
Luckily, you will get some help
later in the game in the form of
crew members. There are over 30
crew members in the game, and
they are either slimes or
monsters you have captured (more
on the monster catching later).
Crew members have specific
commands they can perform, some
more useful than others. Some
have two commands, and you can
toggle which one they can
perform when the game is paused.
These crew members really opens
up a variety of things you can
do to win a battle. Some
commands are to gather ammo,
fire the cannons, infiltrate the
enemy tank, or defend your own
tank from intruders.

That's the basics of the tank
battles, which are the high
point of the game. On the other
hand, there's the adventure. The
normal "run through dungeons
collecting stuff" sounds good on
paper, but it isn't up to par in
Rocket Slime. Rocket must use
his Elasto Blast in order to do
well...pretty much everything.
Your Elasto Blast technique is
used to damage and defeat
enemies, pick up objects, and
open chests. In short, you have
to use your Elasto Blast for
virtually everything you do in
the game. You can upgrade the
technique later in the game, but
it proves to be less useful than
expected; only destroying an
obstacle seen rarely through the
game.

At the end of most dungeons, you
will face a boss. Instead of
fighting them in a tank battle,
you'll have to dispose of them
on your own two feet. Erm, well
you know what I mean.
Unfortunately, all of the bosses
are ridiculously easy and
require little to no strategy in
order to defeat them. The game
is most likely aimed towards a
younger audience, so there
aren't many challenges aside
from the tank battles. Speaking
of tank battles, they're pretty
common. You will find large
podiums scattered around
dungeons. Step on one and play
the Warrior's Flute (that flute
you stole/ate in the beginning
of the game) to start the
battle.

Other than defeating bosses and
engaging in tank battles, all
that's left to do is collect
stuff. The real purpose of the
game is to rescue the slimes,
but there's other junk to
collect that's essential to
completing the game. Slimes are
usually found in random,
unguarded areas. Open the chest
with an Elasto Blast and stick
'em on your back. Well, what
now? I'm sure you have noticed
the train carts rolling through
the dungeons. The trains aren't
exactly scarce, and you can
probably find a set of tracks
every couple screens. This train
system goes to Boingburg, so you
can throw things on the cart to
bring them back to town. Chuck
the slime on a cart, and they'll
be safe and sound in no time. A
nice addition is that they send
you a thank you letter with a
gift inside.

Another important item to
collect are various objects
found in the dungeons. Pick up a
random item and throw it on a
cart to be shipped back to town.
It will most likely be able to
be used as ammo. Make sure to
bring items back to town often;
it's one of the only ways to get
ammo for your tank. Aside from
defeating those baddies
scattered around the world, you
can also ship them back to
Boingburg as well. Once you do,
they will be part of the
community and live happily ever
after. If you collect 30 of one
monster species, they can be
used as a crew member in your
tank!

There are only seven levels to
traverse though. Yeah, that is
it. Some of the levels are quite
lengthy and require several
trips in order to explore it
from head to toe, but c'mon. The
dungeons are also pretty boring:
two forests, two deserts, two
mountains, and a castle. It
could have been spruced up more
so it didn't seem like we were
revisiting the same places over
and over. Rocket Slime is also
fairly short; it takes less than
15 hours to beat. I was let down
by the overall gameplay, but the
tank battles balanced the sides
out.


Replay Value Once the short
quest comes to a halt, you won't
be left in the dust, which is
always a good thing. There are a
lot of things to collect, but
needless to say, it isn't the
most riveting of activities. You
can create monster statues in
the museum by collecting a
certain number of monsters.
Collect 30 for a bronze statue,
50 for a silver one, and 100 for
a super shiny gold one. Of
course, it's only for show and
only completion freaks will get
a kick out of it.

There's also a minigame called
Tank Masters. It's a large
tournament which pits your tank
against enemies in a mini-
tourney. There are four classes;
each containing three battles.
After completing all four
classes, you can engage in the
ultimate battle. Needless to
say, it's the hardest battle in
the game. Not only can you
replay all battles, but you can
also use any tank in the game.
Once you beat it, you can use
it. On the subject of tanks, you
can always upgrade your tank
more and more by adding powerful
ammo and winning new weapons, so
you can use them in multiplayer
mode. Dueling your tanks with a
friend is a real blast, but it's
a too bad that there's no Wi-Fi
capabilities.

Another sweet treat is that you
can replay all battles. You can
replay all tank battles and boss
battles. There really isn't any
motivation to fight earlier tank
battles unless you want to
totally decimate their weak
machine with your all-mighty
uber tank. But hey, at least it
was included. I was surprised by
the number of things you can do
when the game ends. It's a nice
breath of fresh air so you won't
be too tempted to toss Rocket
Slime in the corner after
quickly beating the main quest.
The more things to do, the
merrier.


Overall (not an average): 7/10

Pros
+ The graphics are colorful, and
+ The sound effects are quite cu
+ Controls are simple enough to 
+ Tank battles are downright awe
+ The game is funny, with hilari
+ Pretty good replay value

Cons
- The story is too boring and ge
- Music is easily forgettable
- Way too short
- Incredibly easy
- The main adventure is too tedi
- Too... much... collecting!

The perfect word to describe
Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket
Slime is "charming". There's no
point denying it: the colorful
graphics, the cute sound
effects, the silly humor shows
how delightful this game is. The
graphics are crisp and the
animations are smooth; the
backgrounds are pretty and the
sprites are gnarly. The controls
are easy to the point of being
almost too simplistic, but
that's a good thing. What
distances Rocket Slime from
others is its sense of humor: it
may try too hard at times, but
overall it's a hilarious game.
The gameplay is split in two:
its boring overall, but the tank
battles really make the game
enjoyable. There are so many
good things about DQH: Rocket
Slime, but unfortunately, the
cons balance out the goods which
pretty much condemns it to the
