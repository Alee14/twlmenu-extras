    [CHANGES1] IMPORTANT NOTICE!

This guide was written for the
EU version of this game. Many
readers play the American
version, and thus, find my guide
confusing due to changed names.

Here's a list of changed names:

Characters
__________

Shiida = Caeda (probably the
least guessable) Nabarl =
Navarre

Key Terms
_________

Akaneia = Archanea
Medon = Macedon
Doluna = Dolhr

Classes

Chameleon = Freelancer


I hope this section has
clarified many previous
confusions in my guide. Note
that I will place notices in
various places to maximize the
chance of a reader finding it.

Introduction [1A]
_-_-_-_-_-_-

Welcome all to my guide. This is
OboeDude's fifth written guide
and his first complete
walkthrough! (Rest were Mini-
FAQs).

THIS GUIDE WILL CONTAIN
SPOILERS!

I hope you endured the attempted
ASCII art above, I am relatively
new to making them.

As you [might] have read above,
this game will cover pretty much
every corner of this game. There
is a few excepts (Nintendo WFC
details)

The Force tells me you are
impatient, let us begin!

-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Game Controls [1B]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_

This game has relatively easy
controls, there are two
scenarios. In battle and in
preparation/start menu.

In preparation/start menu:

A - Select Choice B - Go back
X,Y - Nothing Directional pad -
Move around menu R - Used in
certain spots, like in the save
screen.

OPTIONAL: You can use the stylus
for all these commands.

In battle:

A - Select unit, select action
(Fight, Trade, etc). When unit
moves, holding A makes them move
faster (credit to dreamermag) B
- Undo Action X - Activates and
deactivates DANGER zone
(explained later) Y - When held,
you can scroll the screen faster
(credit to dreamermag) R -
Toggles upper DS screen.
Directional Pad - Choose Action,
move character

OPTIONAL: Stylus is possible,
though I recommend staying with
the buttons.


NOW FOR SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE
MISS OUT ON!!

In dialogue, pressing the
R-button shows a nice list that
you can read what was said just
before in the conversation.


-_-_-_-_-_
Game Modes [1C]
_-_-_-_-_-

Game Modes are split into two
sections: main game and extras.

Main Game: The main storyline.
Basically, the bulk of the game.
The main thing to note here is
that you choose between Normal
and Hard Mode.

Extras: There are some extra
features here:

1) You can erase data here
2) Online Nintendo WFC (and
   wireless too) - there are two
   real features of
this. First, you can loan and
receive characters.

You can also fight with friends
and others. Note: I don't do WFC
online for DS.

On Wi-Fi, there are two ways to
end a game:

A) At the end of the turn count,
have the castle in your
possesion. B) Eliminate the
entire enemy army.

The game usually ends with (B)
way more than with (A), since
there is a large turn count.

Note: You can add options online
like Fog of War and other extra
options.


________________________________
About Cheating and Hacking

Every once in a while, you will
encounter people who have some
ridiculously weird/strong army.
Most of them are dishonest
hackers/cheaters.

Sometimes, they will only hack
for a slight advantage and you
still have a chance to beat them
fairly. However, some hackers
just don't play that way. If you
encounter a suspicious player,
try to beat them. If it is
clearly impossible (maybe the
guy made it so that the only
damage amount you do is 0), then
quit or lose fast.

Game Basics [1D]
_-_-_-_-_-_

You are given an army of (insert
amount of characters here) to
defeat the enemy To finish a
map, you have to usually defeat
the boss and "seize" (with
Marth) the spot he was on.

There are various terrains that
offer their own bonuses. Forests
are pretty common and give a
bonus in avoiding attacks. Other
terrains include hills and
mountains, some of which are
special in that they hinder
troop movement.

There is gold in this game also,
you get it from selling items
and chests. Enemies DO NOT drop
gold. There are also a set
amount of enemies for a map, it
isn't randomly generate battles.

There is a weapon triangle,
between the three: swords,
lance, axe. They offer small
bonuses, yet unlike other games,
this game doesn't really make
swords superior to axes by a
vast amount.

It goes:

Sword >>> Axes
Axes >>> Lances
Lances >>> Swords

Each character (and enemy) have
a class, such as Mercenary or
Fighter. They have their own
weapon skill, a mercenary for
example can only use swords. He
can't use axes to fight, only
swords. Only a few unpromoted
units can use two different
weapon types (Cavaliers)

A unit can "promote" to the next
class by using an item called
the Master Seal. An archer will
be promoted to a powerful
sniper. A mercenary becomes a
Hero.

These promoted classes are
stronger than the unpromoted and
often can use two weapon types
(ie, lances and bow).

Each character has its own stats
(short for statistics). They
grow each time you level up. To
level up, you need to gain 100
exp. Exp (short for experience)
is gained by killing enemies.
Harder enemies give more
experience and bosses tend to
give a full level. Note that
promoted classes level up
slower.

Characters will die if they
reach 0 health. Once they die,
they are gone forever. You can't
get them back. (Well, you
technically can get ONE unit
back in chapter 24, but
nevertheless, it isn't worth it
since the unit will be seriously
underleveled)

Going back to stats, they
increase pretty randomly.
Sometimes, you won't even gain
any stats and sometimes you'll
gain in all but two stats. Some
characters have better "stat
growths" then others. However,
stat growth is still mostly
determined by a game function
called RNG (Random Number
Generator).

Sometimes you get good stat
growths from the RNG, other
times not so much.

There are different stats.
Strength, Magic, Skill, Spd,
Lck, Def, Res... Most of them
are self-explanatory:

Strength, Magic: (Depends on
what class you are) Affects how
high you hit.

Skill: How often criticals are.

Spd: How well you avoid enemies.

(The following was found on
serenesforest's great combat
equations)

Lck: Affects critical avoid rate
and a little bit on accuracy and
avoid.

Def: Reduces physical damage

Res: Reduces magic damage.


In battle, there are five
different unique structures:

1) Village: Gives you items such
   as gold or units. Must visit
   with main
character. Sometimes gives
weapons
2) House: Gives tips. Nothing
   else. Can be visited by any
   unit
3) Armory: Sells weapons. Can be
   visited by any unit.
4) Shop: Sells magic such as
   Blizzard and Heal. Also has
   potions like pure
water.
5) Fort: Heals your character at
   the beginning of the Player
   Phase.

There are also some more unique
objects:

1) Door - Obstructs path. Must
   use thief or Door key to get
   by.
2) Chest - Contains useful item.
   Must use their of use a key.

One last thing: I mentioned
DANGER zone once. Might as well
explain here.

DANGER zones can be accessed by
hitting X in battle. They show
where all the enemies can move,
the boundaries. It is useful in
planning how far to move a unit
to lure in the enemy.

That should be good enough for
the basics of basics, read the
game's tutorial if you REALLY
can't figure it out.


-_-_-_-_-
Hard Mode [1E]
_-_-_-_-_


As many of you might have
noticed, this guide does not
cover the hard mode part of this
game.

The Hard Mode is the same game
as the Normal mode, same story.
The only difference is the
insane difficulty added onto the
characters. There are five
different difficulties in Hard
Mode, ranging from * to *****
(with ***** being the most
difficult).

I do intend on eventually
writing a ***** guide, but I
wish to first adding on and
making my Normal Mode section
improved.

Please note that I am extremely
open to H5 (Hard Mode *****)
help and advice.


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Houses/Dialogue Format [1F]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


I find it prudent for this guide
to relate the various dialogue
that occurs in this story. The
format is as follows:

(for Dialogue)

--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

[insert dialogue from Character1
here] [insert dialogue from
Character2 here] [insert
dialogue from Character1 here]

(insert action such as Character
1 leaving)

[insert dialogue from Character2
here]

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


These sections are separated by
two spaces before and after to
make reading easier.

For houses, I will summarize
what happens tips the people
give you at the beginning of the
chapter. It will look as
follows:


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) [insert useful tip]
2) [insert not-so-useful tip]
3) [insert obvious tip]
4) [insert not-so-obvious tip]

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


As you can see, it should be
easy to read and distinct
between the regular text



-_-_-_-_-
The Forge [1G]
_-_-_-_-_


Starting when you are able to
prepare before battles, you can
access a forge feature via
"Armory" >>> "Forge".

Basically, you pay gold to
upgrade a certain weapon. This
is useful in helping weaker
characters out at the beginning.

There are different stats you
can upgrade:

Mt (Short for might - thanks to
Johnny D): Upgrades how much you
can damage.

Hit: Upgrades how often you hit.

Crit (short for critical):
Upgrades how often you land a
critical.

Wt (Short for weight): Changes
how hefty a weapon is, a less
heavy weapon lets the user hit
x2 instead of the regular one
hit.


First, you have to pay the
initial cost. This depends on
what type of weapon your unit is
holding. It also depends on the
type of weapon (Bow, Sword, Axe)

Note: Devil Weapons cannot be
forged. Firestones cannot. Also,
items like the Parthia cannot be
forged.

Also note that the price does
not change if you are forging an
item with only 1 durability
compared to if you forged it
with 30 durability.


Here are the initial costs:
(thanks to serenesforest since I
honestly wouldn't have figured
this out myself - note that I
don't copy it exactly)

Note that this below chart is
pretty useful for when I explain
it later.

Here it is:

--------------------------------
Base Value/2 (refer to above) +
((Decimal upgrade) X Base Value)
= Cost
--------------------------------


Here is the way the upgraded
stats are worked out. You have
to refer to the next chart:


50% - 1 Mt/5 Hit/3 Crit/1 Wt

150% - 2 Mt/10 Hit/6 Crit/2 Wt

300% - 3 Mt/15 Hit/9 Crit/3 Wt

500% - 4 Mt/20 Hit/12 Crit/4 Wt

750% - 5 Mt/25 Hit/15 Crit/5 Wt

1050% - 6 Mt/30 Hit/18 Crit/6 Wt

1400% - 7 Mt/35 Hit/21 Crit/7 Wt

1800% - 8 Mt/40 Hit/24 Crit/8 Wt

2250% - 9 Mt/45 Hit/27 Crit/9 Wt

2750% - 10 Mt/50 Hit/30 Crit/10
Wt


Most of you are probably
wondering what the above section
was all about. Well, simply put,
you need to refer to the top
chart for each upgrade you make.

That means that if you upgrade
the damage, hit rate, and
critical, then you need to refer
to the above chart three times.
Basically, just find the % for
all three stats.

For example, if I am forging a
weapon and making it have +1 Mt,
+10 Hit, and +3 Crit, then I
will find the th

Then, you need to make them into
decimal form them add them
together. Taking my example
above, I get:

0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.5

This number is the cost for the
upgrade (called the decimal
upgrade in the equation).

Let's put this to example. Say I
am forging a Silver Sword for +1
Mt, +50 Hit, +27 Crit, and -4
Wt. Here are th

1) I find the base cost of a
   silver sword. 2000G.
2) I refer to the charts and get
   the four %s. In order: 50%,
   2750%, 2250%, 500%
3) I convert them into decimals.
   In order: 0.5, 27.5, 22.5, 5.
4) I add them together to get
   55.5.
5) Plug in the equation:

2000/2 + ((55.5) * 2000) =
112,000

Highly Recommended Party [1H]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


The following is a list of units
that I will recommend
using/looking into. THEY ARE IN
NO PARTICULAR ORDER!

1) Wolf - This character is
   amazing. Just simply, his
   stats growth outplays
the fact that he even comes
later. He starts out pre-
promoted, but seriously, his
stats still beat most
characters.

2) Abel - This Cavalier is one
   of the most reliable. I know
   that at the higher
levels, I can send him to lure
in a unit without getting
killed.

3) Frey - Just below Abel, he
   matches well and can be
   described like Abel. High
strength gain rate, making him a
powerhouse.

4) Marth - Necessary obviously.
   But he is strong on his own
   and can fight
decently.

5) Shiida - Once she gets to
   those higher levels and is
   promoted, she will be
a monster with lances. Good
movement rate too.


(Called Caeda in American
version)


6) Merric - His proficiency with
   magic is astounding. Rips
   knights to shreds.
Only problem is his defence.

7) Gordin - I explain this in
   the section you get him. He
   isn't weak. Give him
a chance to prove himself as a
sniper and you won't regret. Of
course, charac- ters like Wolf
outclass him if you unlucky with
stat gains. Still, he makes for
a good pre-Wolf game character
and a great sniper if you are
lucky.

8) Lena - Healers are always
   necessary in your party and
   she is like one of the
earliest, yet best healers you
will get. Enough said I believe.

9) Nabarl - His low defence
   makes him questionable in
   making this list.
However, the myrmidon lovers
won't find a better one to use
than him. Critical hits are
often and once he becomes a
swordmaster, he will tear
through almost any unit,
generals included.


(Called Navarre in the American
version)


10) Sedgar - I personally never
    used this character. I chose
    between Wolf and
Sedgar and stuck with Wolf.
Though I heard that Sedgar is
just as good as Wolf so I
decided to add him to this list.


11) Beck - Strong ballista. Due
    to the nature of this game,
    ballistas have many
weapons that let it kill various
units. First, Beck can destroy
other ballistas Then, Beck can
also kill all fliers with
Arrowspatte. To top this off,
Beck can even shoot through
walls, and his range is
incredible. Solid unit that is
topped off with a good stat
increase.


NOTE: As a general rule, units
that come pre-promoted are
usually inferior to those that
do not. I do not recommend using
any pre-promoted units other
than Wolf and Sedgar (note that
units like Beck and Marth cannot
be promoted so they aren't
considered "pre-promoted") and
that Wolf and Sedgar are
overpowered, so they make an
exception.

Also NOTE that I do not
encourage the early use of a
Manakete. The first one you can
possibly use in the game is
limited to 30
attacks/counterattacks due to
the 30/30 USE of the Firestone.
This means that basically he is
useless after he runs out of
attacks, making him an
unreliable character.

Reclassing Guide/Wi-Fi Guide
[1I]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


Many users have wondered how to
take advantage of the reclassing
system. So naturally, this
section will hopefully answer
most questions about reclassing.

Note: I tied this into a Wi-Fi
guide since creating a great
online team usually requires a
bit of reclassing.


Wolf + Sedgar ---> Hero/General
(for maximum stats) Merric --->
Curate (controversal issue)


The above two are the most
advocated reclassing tips.
However, they are quite specific
and don't cover the majority of
units.

A good general tip (used
especially in Wi-Fi) is to:


Train a mage to 20/10 (lvl 10
promoted), then to reclass to
Swordmaster. Equip the Levin
Sword (use an Arms Scroll if
necessary) and you should do
hefty dmg (note that the Levin
Sword's damage IS indeed based
on magic).

Also do note that you should
level up the 10 remaining levels
as Swordsman to raise your
Speed.

This tip is good online, but not
on the main game since you
probably will run out of Levin
Swords quickly.


Two general tips (one obvious
while one isn't):

- Reclassing DOES change your ch
factors determine the growth:

1) Your character
2) Class

For example, Shiida, as a
character, has great Spd growth.
No matter what class I give her,
she probably will max out speed
by the end of the game.

In another example, if I took a
character with low speed and
made them into a
myridomn/swordmaster, their
speed growth would be increased
by the class


- Don't reclass a STR character 
with horrible MAG stats...unless
you intentionally know what you
are doing.

On certain days, you can buy
items on Wi-Fi. Some, like the
Elysian whip, are exclusive to
the online shop. An item may
only appear on, say, dates that
end with a one.

Below, items and their
respective cost are grouped by
the available time.

Prologue [CHP0]
_-_-_-_-


"Long ago, Medeus, king of the
dragonkin, conquered the
continent of Akaneia beginning
an age of fear and despair for
all it's people. That tyranny
was broken, however, thanks to a
miracle. A young man hailing
from the Altea region appeared
with a divine blade in hand. He
stood against the Shadow Dragon
,and struck him down. For some
time after, the land enjoyed an
age of peace.

However, after a century's
passing, the Shadow Dragon
returned. He forged an alliance
with a fiendish sorcerer who
sought to rule the world, and
their combines might toppled
kingdom upon unsuspecting
kingdom. Again, darkness
threatened to engulf the
continent. It fell upon the king
of Altea, sole descendant of the
dragon-slayer hero, to sally
forth with the divine blade and
fulfill his blood destiny.

His son, Prince Marth, remained
at home with the boy's mother,
his elder sister ,and a garrison
manned by Altea's neighbor and
ally, Gra. Thus the boy applied
himself to the ways of both pen
and sword, until one day..."

The game opens in a musty castle
corridor, Marth is walking to an
exit when he is greeted by...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

(Note: anything written in []
are comments by me.)

Soldier: Prince Marth... Are you
awake? Beggin' your pardon,
sire, but the princess has asked
to see you. [Get used to the
weird way they talk]

Marth: Elice? Is she all right?

Soldier: She seemed to be, sire,
but her words implied a certain
urgency. She bade you dress
quickly and wait by the throne.

Marth: ...Has something
happened?

Soldier: It's our forces off in
Gra, sire. There seems to 'ave
been some sort of incident,
but... Well, I'm not privy to
the specifics.

Marth: I see... Thank you. I'll
be there shortly.

(Soldier leaves conversation)

Marth: My sister said she would
meet me by the throne.

Marth: An incident in Gra... If
Elice had news of our father, I
pray it's good news...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Welcome to the first battle of
the game. If you are following
this guide the whole way through
(which is pretty much
recommended), you should turn
the tutorial off. You can always
go back and read it by pressing
A on any empty square and
selecting guide.

Anyway, you are left in a
seemingly empty hall. It's not
going to be that way soon, but
don't worry, just move as far as
you can toward the throne.

Soon after, the enemies
appear...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy soldier: O'er there,
that's him! Prince Marth!

(Marth enters conversation)

Marth: Wha- Who are you?!

Enemy soldier: We're soldiers of
Gra, li'l prince. And if you
know what's good for you, you'll
surrender to us without makin'
any trouble.

Marth: Surrender? But that's
ridiculous... Why would I
surrender to the army of an
allied kingdom?

Enemy soldier: Meh heh heh...
They don't tell you much do
they? No matter. You'll 'ave the
full story soon enough.
Now...lay down your sword.

Marth: I will not. I am the
prince of Altea. I will not
yield to you or any other
nation, here on my own land,
under my own castle roof!

Enemy soldier: Heh, you talk
big, brat. Have it your way. If
you won't lay down your sword,
then we'll just have to take
your life instead!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The hapless idiots move toward
you. Don't worry about anything
in this fight, the enemies are
pathetically weak. Just attack
the closest one with any weapon
of choice (might want to save
your Rapier for later).

On the enemy phase, you will be
attacked by one guy. You should
automatically kill him on your
counter-attack.

Back to your turn, move close to
the throne (as far as possible).

The next guy that attacks you is
harder, it will take three
strikes to kill him (that would
mean two strikes of any weapon
then another).

Anyhow, they won't do too much
damage to you so don't worry.
The next enemy is programmed to
wait for you to cross through
the small gap.

--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy soldier: What? He is
fighting back? I'll show him!

Marth: No! The throne... I have
to get rid of him before my
sister arrives!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


After that short scene, just go
up to the throne and attack him
with your weapon of choice. He
should be dead soon after his
counterattack. Seize the throne
after. Choose "Yes" to proceed.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Elice: Marth, are you all right?

(Marth enters conversation)

Marth: Sister, what is
happening?

Elice: Steady yourself, Marth. I
have grave news. Our father was
defeated by the Doluna-Grust
allied forces.

Marth: What? No...

Elice: It was Gra. Our own ally
betrayed us and struck Father's
army from the rear. I am... I am
not sure if he is safe. The
scouts who returned gave confl-
icting reports...

Marth: Father...It can't be...

Elice: As we speak, soldiers
sent by Gra are trying to take
the castle. Mother and I were
separated during the escape. I
do not know where she is.

Marth: .....

Elice: Marth, I need you to
listen to me. You must flee the
castle. Go on without me.

Marth: What?

Elice: We've not many soldiers
left...This is hard to bear, I
know, but the castle is lost. We
must face that. I will look for
Mother and join you as soon as I
can. You find Jagen and get away
from here- far away. Understand?

Marth: ...All right. But promise
you won't be long.

(Marth leaves conversation)

Elice: Goodbye, Marth. May you
live long...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


You are presented the
opportunity to save here. Do so
in any slot, then go on.

Two horsemen will approach you
(allies)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Frey: Sire!

Marth: ...Frey! Abel! You're
alive!

Abel: Yes, sire. Princess Elice
bade us protect you. Sir
Malledus stayed behind to
accompany her.

Frey: Sire, we must be quick.
Sir Jagen awaits us at the
gates.

(Brief exit of dialogue, shows
enemies appearing)

Abel: Blast! This will not do.
How did Gra's soldiers ever make
it this far?

Marth: Jagen and the others will
be caught like mice...We need to
seize the gates and secure the
area, immediately.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Notice: From now on, you have
the choice of WHO you want to
level. I will tell you who I
WOULD level, but you don't have
to listen.

If you, for example, favored
Frey over Abel, just give Abel's
weapons to Frey and put him in a
corner. It is important that you
make these sort of choices at
times, you will fail if you try
and level everyone evenly.

For now, I would keep both
Cavaliers sorta balanced and
Marth getting exp when the
Cavaliers are tied up.

Right off the beginning, take
one Cavalier and destroy the
first soldier.

I would take Abel to do it, so
Frey can deal with the far-left
enemy. Remember the weapon
triangle and use a sword instead
of the lance.

Marth should just advance
normally. Without warning, the
enemy decides to talk


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy soldier: Now who's that
who thinks they can sneak up on
us? Ho ho... What's this? I spy
the Altean prince. Oi, listen
up, you lot! Bag the prince!
Dead or alive, he'll fetch us as
sweet a reward as the mind can
conjure.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The far-left enemy should
counter-attack Frey and die
because of it. One enemy troop
should move forward and Marth
will comment about the
archers...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Hmm, they have archers...
We need to take care they don't
pick us off from afar.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The next soldier should be taken
by Abel. Steel sword should kill
him in two hits.

Note: Even though it goes
against the weapon triangle,
sometimes it is worth checking
it out to see if it works
anyway.

After this, just advance Marth
further. One archer should
attack Marth, use Marth to take
care of him (might take two
turns) As for the other archer,
use Abel. Use the Javelin and
watch the enemy counter-attack
and die.

After this turn, use Marth to
finish off the archer, and use
Abel to Javelin the boss to
death (should only take one
turn, he's that weak).

Seize the gate after.

A friendly Paladin by the name
of Jagen will appear to talk...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Jagen: Sire, it gladdens me to
see you in one piece. It's not
safe for you here; we must be
away at once!

(Cain enters conversation)

Cain (from a distance): Prince
Marth! Where are you? Answer me,
sire!

Marth (from a distance): Cain?
...That's Cain!

(Cain moves in closer)

Marth: Cain, you're supposed to
be in Gra! Why have you returned
without- Yow! Those wounds...!

Cain: Sire, it's really you...I
feared the worst. That his
message would go
undeliv...Agh...

Marth: In that state, I don't
know how you even stayed ahorse.
Those gashes must be treated at
once-

Jagen: No, sire. Not until we've
escaped.

...Cain, I trust you can put off
bleeding to death for just a
while longer?

Cain: Of course, sir... I aim to
please...

(screen flashes to a different
conversation between Malledus
and Elice)

Malledus: Princess Elice! The
enemy is nearly upon us! Gather
your things, quickly!

Elice: No, Malledus. I am
staying here.

Malledus: S-staying here?! What
madness is this?

Elice: Too many people have died
to keep Altea and it's castle
safe.

I cannot abandon what so many
lives have brought. With Father
and Mother unaccounted for, I am
the natural choice to remain
with Altea's people.

And besides, by staying, I can
buy time for the rest of you to
escape.

Malledus: Nonsense. Just gather
your things, and-

Elice: Malledus. I am not
suggesting. I am commanding. If
something befalls Father, Marth
will become the last person in
the entire world worthy of
wielding the Falchion. I want
you to guide him, Malledus- even
when the rest of us no longer
can.

Malledus: Princess...I will try
my best.

Elice: There's not much time.
Go, Malledus. ...Go!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Chance to save again. Do so
then...you can either read the
stuff written or you can skip.
Either way I AM writing...


"Thus Prince Marth escaped Altea
Castle with Sir Jagen and
company at his side. However,
this success would mean little
to him once he learned the cost.
The boy's woes were just
beginning."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Cain, how are your
wounds? You should rest.

Cain: These scratches? It's my
pride you're wounding sire.
...Anyway, we must talk. There's
a reason I've returned. ...Sire,
I am...I am to deliver to you
His Majesty's last words.

Marth: Last words? You don't
mean...Father...

Cain: My condolences, sire. The
king died valiantly on the
fields of Gra. The traitors took
from him the divine blade
Falchion and gave no quarter to
those of our soldiers who
remained...

Marth: I...I see...So they're
all dead. Father, too...

Cain: His last words were as
follows:

"Tell my son that I leave the
future of Altea and our
continent in his hands. He must
rise now where I have fallen. As
Falchion's rightful heir, he has
been born into
greatness...Now...he must be
great"

Marth: ...Father. I will try...

Cain: ...Sire, I...I cannot bear
this! Failing to protect His
Majesty...then leaving my
brothers to die, slinking away
like some coward...This
indignity is too much to bear!
One day I will repay them in
kind. I will avenge the
fallen...I swear it!

Marth: Cain, you speak for us
both. When that day comes, we
will punish them together: Gra,
Doluna...all of them!

(Jagen enters conversation)

Jagen: Sire! We ought to pay a
visit to these homes outside the
castle.

(home flashes)

Jagen: Your countrymen love you;
perhaps they have knowledge that
may serve us.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Alright, here comes a decision
part. I would only keep two
cavaliers in a party at any
time. Choose between Abel, Cain,
and Frey. Personally, I chose
Abel and Frey since they already
had exp.

Note: You will understand the
importance of choosing two out
of three in the second battle
after this. Trust me for now.

Oh and automatically sit Jagen
at the corner of the map. He is
what they call a pre-promoted
character, he comes to you as
strong. For now he is extremely
powerful compared to other
characters (especially with his
silver lance), but if you don't
want to mess up your other
characters, leave him doing
nothing.

For the cavalier you decided you
don't want, trade his equipment
to other char- acters and then
leave him sitting there.

There are four houses in this
map. There is no penalty for not
visiting a house but they do
have valuable information
sometimes.

Since this is a COMPLETE guide,
yet I don't think it's necessary
to write everything out, I will
summarize the main points of the
houses in each level. Note that
this information was in section
[1F].


--------------------------------
HOUSES:

1) Don't rush hastily when
   attacking enemies. Sometimes
   it's better to lure in
one enemy at a time.

2) Don't let Jagen get all the
   kills (even this NPC agrees
   with me) or you
might be in  trouble later

3) Forts (a terrain structure)
   will heal you.

4) Javelins and other long range
   weapons can...fight long
   range.

5) Weapons break when the number
   next to them reach 0.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


So anyway, starting next battle
that has houses, the houses part
will go to the top of a section.

Advance with our three
characters (two Cavaliers and
Marth). Use one cavalier to
attack the soldier at the bottom
of the screen.

After the first move, Jagen
decides to interrupt:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Jagen: Look sire. Not all of
Gra's might harries the castle.
They've left soldiers here
outside.

Marth: Elice will have no plans
to escape...Let's seize that
fort across the water. Perhaps
we can squash enemy
reinforcement at the source.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


One of your cavaliers that you
sent will defeat another enemy.
Two other enemies will move
toward your position.

Use that same cavalier to attack
the archer. Experiment with the
different weapons to find one
that will kill the archer in two
strikes. That same cavalier will
destroy the adjacent enemy when
he attacks. Now, move that
cavalier out of the way and let
the other two characters get
some exp.

Your other two characters,
should easily defeat the
enemies. Just focus on specific
enemies (archers), retreat if
you mess up, and remember that
counter attacks are your friend.

Once you approach the bridge
leading to the last two enemy
(mages), Marth will make a
simple observation


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Mages...That will
complicate things. They don't
need to get as close to do us
harm.

We'll need to approach
carefully.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Okay, so you're probably all
confident from beating those
easy enemies, right?

Well pay attention, mages in
this game hit abnormally high.
Lure the first mage in, then
kill him. Watch out for you HP,
they deal a hefty 8 damage.

Now, one of your characters is
probably seriously hurt, take
the other one and defeat the
boss. Seize and...more
dialogue...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: There. That ought to do
for the enemy soldiers around
here. Malledus! Why aren't you
with my sister? Did you leave
her someplace safe?

Malledus: ...Princess Elice will
not be joining us. She has
elected to stay at the castle.

(Marth runs the way you guys
came from and Malledus blocks
him)

Malledus: Hold, sire! Where are
you going?

Marth: Where do you think!
[Should be a ?]

Malledus: Stop! Sire, consider
for a moment why the princess
would go as far as to lie to you
to ensure your escape. Your
sister knows that you are the
future of Altea- nay, the whole
land!

Marth: .....!

(flashes to Cain + Marth
conversation earlier)

Cain: His last words were as
follows:

"Tell my son that I leave the
future of Altea and our
continent in his hands. He must
rise now where I have fallen. As
Falchion's rightful heir, he has
been born into
greatness...Now...he must be
great"

(out of flashback)

Marth: I'm...our future...

Malledus: Sire... You must live.
Drink deeply now of these
injustices; sip on these slights
they serve. Remember them! One
day you will lead us back here
to avenge the fallen and reclaim
Altea in their names [plural
incident]!

Marth: ...Then it seems my life
is no longer mine to hazard.

Malledus: In your veins flows
the blood of a hero- the blood
of Anri. You are a son of House
Akaneia, and sole heir to
Falchion- our only hope of
defeating Medeus, emperor of
Doluna. Sire, were't in my
power, I would have you choose
you own path...but I'm afraid
your path has chosen you.

Marth: ......

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Save the game.

"Marth and his knights took
refuge in a forest near Altea's
borders, lying low while they
waiting for the right chance to
escape the kingdom. Before long,
the enemy grew less watchful:
the time to slip away had come.

Still, the prince could not
quell the sadness in his heart
for his sister Elice."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Prince Marth. ...Sire?
Sire! Are you listening?!

Marth: Huh? ...Oh. Malledus.

Malledus: Get ahold of yourself,
Sire! I know how you grieve, but
the Gra host that pursues us
will not be interested. We must
keep moving, and with all haste
at that.

Marth: I...I'm sorry. These
thoughts are hard to put aside.

Malledus: From here, we will
cross out of Altea and begin our
escape to Talys. I trust you are
prepared?

Marth: Talys... I've heard the
name. An island kingdom to the
east, isn't it?

Malledus: That is correct. The
king there was a good friend to
your father- and perhaps more
importantly, a true friend. It
was Princess Elice's wish that
you seek refuge in Talys should
things ever go awry.

Marth: Me, but not her...

Malledus: I've arranged for a
boat to take us from the
northeast shore. But to get
there, we'll first need to cut
through a prison to the north. I
managed to come by a key to the
premises. Let me hand it over.

(Obtain Door Key)

Malledus: Now, on the road, you
may notice people who seem to be
fighting for Gra against their
own wishes. Before you resort to
your blade, you should try
talking to them first.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


So the battle begins, but
first...


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) The enemy army is gonna own
   you bad. They're coming fast.
2) It is necessary to part with
   a person if it means getting
   a different char

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


Alright, this is the map where
you will have to use your
character in...ways.

Defeat the first three troops.

After you end your first phase,
the enemy in the back will
talk...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Captain: Enemies south of the
prison?

Enemy soldier: Yes, sir. Not
many of 'em, but the scouts say
they're a tough bunch all the
same. And guess who's with
'em...

Captain: ...You're saying the
prince is coming this way?

Soldier: Yes, sir. How ought we
proceed? The main force 'as yet
to arrive, and- to be honest,
sir- we need 'em.

Captain: Bah! You're cowed too
easily. We can win...if we set a
trap [lol he calls what he about
to do a TRAP? More like a
mistake]

Soldier: Er...a trap, sir?

Captain: The prince of Altea
will be ours.

Just do as I tell you, and we'll
pluck this royal plum long
before the main force can show
up to steal all the glory.
Heh...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The enemies will finish their
turn then the "trap" is set.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Ruffian: You! Inside!

Gordin: Grrrmph...

Ruffian: Heh. I thought Altea
was the great 'ero Anri's
kingdom! Didn't take more'n a
couple of days to break you, now
did it, Gaggles?

Gordin: Mmph! Arrumph!

Ruffian: What's the matter,
Gaggles? Can't talk cause you're
gagged, Gaggles? Ba ha ha!
[horrible pun] I'll letcha in on
a little secret. Altea's little
princeling is on 'is way 'ere
right this moment.

Gordin: .....!

Ruffian: Ooh, but sad for you,
you look awful dangerous in the
uniform... MISTER GRA SOLDIER!
Ha! Soon as the prince sees you,
'e'll say, "Yow! It's an enemy
ambush!" -and that'll be the end
of you.

Gordin: Gugrrrmph!

Ruffian: Once the prince sticks
you like a pig, we get to call
him Marth the Tyrant, coz 'e
kills 'is own countrymen

Ruffian: Won't that be an 'oot!

Gordin: Rrrmph.

Ruffian: So long, Gaggles!
Better start praying to your
'igher deity of choice !

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Alright, that was a long
distraction. Basically, just
finish whatever is left of the
two enemies then unlock the door
and recruit "Gaggles" (jk,
Gordin) with Marth. Note that
you should get an iron bow from
one of the enemies.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Yow! It's an enemy
ambush! [Wow...just wow]

Gordin: Rrrgmph mrph!

Marth: Huh? You've been gagged?
Here, I'll get that...

Wait, I know you! You're one of
our archers, er...

Gordin: Gordin, sire! My name is
Gordin. The enemy captured me
and left me in this mortifying
state.

Marth: I see. Well, I'm glad
you're unharmed. But I'm afraid
we cannot stay here a moment
longer. Stay behind me and-

Gordin: I can fight, sire! If
you have a bow I could use, I
would be honored to fight at
your side.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Okay let me tell you, Gordin is
considered to be weak. However,
I do not consider him to be all
that bad. For people who enjoy
abusing stuff in the game, he
can easily become a fantastic
sniper (if you get lucky with
his stat level ups). I recommend
him to be in your party and to
promote him at level 20 (which
isn't hard to get if you abuse
this game with like arena
abusing)


--------------------------------
Notes about Gordin

NOTE: THIS SECTION IS TO THOSE
WHO ARE AT LEAST AT CHAPTER 10+.
IF NOT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CONSIDER SKIPPING THIS SECTION
FOR LATER.

Some readers are wondering why I
choose Gordin over, say Wolf? I
prefer Gordin for his defense.
He can lure in units without
risking too much. For example,
say that a recruitable unit is
just one square away from being
able to be recruited by Marth.

Instead of worrying about the
recruitable unit killing my unit
or my unit killing them, I can
put Gordin there. He will take
the light damage, and won't
retaliate since he is an archer.

This isn't the only use for
Gordin. Yes, he might be
outclassed by a few units, but
overall, he makes for a good
character. Great boss owner if I
might add.

Note: Readers might see Wolf's
defense and compare them with
Gordin's. They will probably
conclude that Wolf isn't too far
behind. However, this is easily
flawed. Wolf comes as a pre-
promoted unit. Of course a lvl
20 Horseman has just about or
more defense than a lvl 20
Archer!

End note.
--------------------------------


Give Gordin the iron bow you
got.

Ouch, seems like the next turn
the main army is back and really
strong. Bunch of dialogue...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Jiol: Listen, men. Your target
is the prince. Find the prince
of Altea and bring me his head
served on a shield!

(he leaves and conversation goes
to Marth + Malledus)

Marth: Look there!

Malledus: No...Anri save us...Of
all the places to be beset!
Sire, that is Gra' s main force-
and they are accompanied by the
knights of Grust's Sable Order.

Our chances of routing them are
slim, I'm afraid, and those of
slipping away undetected
afterward, all but nil...

Marth: Then we've no hope?

Malledus: I...I can think of one
strategy. We could leave a decoy
behind for when the enemy
catches up.

Marth: A decoy?

Malledus: It's you they're
after, sire. Were one of your
men to stay behind disguised as
you...Well, the enemy ought to
take the bait. That would give
you and the others time to
escape.

(points at fort)

Malledus: One of your men must
make for that fortress on the
south highroad. He will act as a
decoy by dressing as you and
luring the enemy force away.

Marth: But Malledus, how will he
find his way back to us?

Malledus: Sire...He may not. You
must part with one of your
comrades. There is no other way.

Marth: ...Well, I will find a
way! You cannot expect me to
agree to...to abandon one of our
own to a death at the hands of
the enemy. Surely there must be
another way...

(Marth leaves)

Malledus: Forgive me, sire...But
this is our only chance. You
know as well as I do that you
must not die here today.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Alright, you have it here in a
nutshell:

The enemy is closing in and you
need to get one of your
characters as a decoy. It is
unavoidable, there is no other
way to finish this chapter since
the door to the boss is locked.
The knights will just keep
advancing.

They are like invincible for
your level. Even Jagen-the-
overpowered paladin with a
silver lance can't kill one.

Now, you must realize that YOU
WILL LOSE your character that
you put as a decoy You have one
of two choice: the cavalier that
you decided not to train OR
Jagen since he is useless
anyway.

Whoever you choose, take
whatever weapons they might have
and put them as decoy One line
of dialogue will follow saying
something like, "I won't fail
you"

Note that the following is
Jagen's dialogue (if he is
chosen to be the decoy)

"Heh, these old bones are still
good for something."

A cutscene will follow.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy soldier 1: Look!
It's...it's Prince Marth!

Enemy soldier 2: Oh yeah? Who's
that, then? That bloke over
there is dressed in the same
clothes. Could be either of 'em.

(Jiol enters)

Jiol: Simpletons! Use your
heads! [What kind of
word...never mind] One of them
ran; the other didn't. What does
that tell you? Easy! The one who
stayed behind is trying to buy
time for the one who fled.

Enemy soldier: So, er...the one
who took off it-

Jiol: The real prince, you
idiot, yes! Hie, troops, after
him! [Should read Hi or Hey
instead of Hie] Put that craven
whip to the sword!

(Whole army leaves)

Marth: (insert name of gone
character)? Wait! (insert name
of gone character)! Quickly,
Malledus, we must head south and
rescue him!

Malledus: No, sire. We have to
press on.

Marth: Press on? (insert name)
might be dying back there!

Malledus: If he is, then why
would you be so selfish as to
let him die in vain? Honor him,
by allowing his life and his
choice to mean something!

Marth: ...(insert name).

Marth: ......

Marth: ...All right. [that was a
lot of pausing]

Marth: I will honor him. ...I
will go.

(conversation moves to enemy)

Captain: The prince fled south?
Bah! Seems the plum's fallen too
far from our tree...

No matter. Open the north door!
We can still crush the Altean
rabble he left behind...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The rest of the map is too easy
to even mention, just defeat the
enemies and the boss. Pegasus
Knights will spawn to the left,
use Gordin's arrows to win.

Anyway, visit the village with
Marth...but wait! Malledus
interrupts...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Sire, there is a
village over yonder. It's
residents may be willing to
help. Why don't you try paying
them a visit!?

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Finally, go to the village get
the steel bow.

Give the steel bow to Gordin
when you get a chance. Then,
just kill the boss with Marth's
rapier and seize.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Draug: Prince Marth! Make haste,
sir!

Marth: Draug, is that you? What
are you doing here?

Draug: I recieved word from Sir
Malledus to ready a vessel, that
we might slip away discreetly by
sea.

The enemy has crossed the border
and closes in on us from the
west; we cannot stay here.
Hurry, sire!

(conversation goes to the main
army with (insert name))

Jiol: This is...the wrong
prince? No! You dare make a fool
of me? Kill him! Make this faux
prince SUFFER!

(insert name): Glory to Altea,
land of my birth! Farewell,
sire! Fortune protect you...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


"And so Marth and his knights
left Altea, heavy of heart and
bleary of age..."


If Jagen was the decoy, the
following conversation will have
Draug instead of Jagen.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Jagen: Look, sire. See how Altea
shrinks on the horizon...

Marth: ..aven...

Jagen: I beg your pardon?

Marth: I am a craven. Powerless
to save my sister, to staunch my
kingdom's wounds; to ease my
people's fears...

Jagen: This...was your only
recourse, sire. But surely, one
day, you will be able to set
things right...

Marth: "Surely"? Why do words of
such conviction smack so much of
uncertainty when spoken? Not
surely, Jagen. Assuredly. Gra
will pay for their acts.

Today, though, all me to wallow
in this pain, to feel every
awful twist of it. I never want
to forget.

Jagen: Sire...

Marth: I will return, Altea!
Your prince will return to you
one day!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Save the game and get ready to
begin the real chapters...

Marth Embarks [CHP1]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"Marth, prince of Altea, was
lucky. Though Doluna took from
him his kingdom and all but a
handful of knights, they could
not take his life. Marth lived,
and made it to the eastern isle
of Talys. Talys was a small
border kingdom, with no grand
order of knights to boast of,
but its king selflessly gave
Marth use of the isle's eastern
fortress. And as he saw the boy
shake with anger and grief, he
also gave wise counsel:

"Prince Marth," he said, "I do
not doubt you love your sister
something great. But you must be
patient...time is on your side.
If you stay here, and grow
stronger, a time will come when
you can help her."

So Marth stayed in Talys,
protected by its kind people,
and the years went by..."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Jagen: Sire! You've a visitor
from the castle. It's Princess
Shiida!

Marth: Shiida, what is it? You
look white as a sheet!


(IMPORTANT NOTICE: Shiida is
called Caeda in the American
version of the game)


Shiida: Marth, come quickly!
It's the castle... Galder's
pirates attacked from out of
nowhere. They stormed the gates
and cut down everyone in their
path! I fear for my father's
life...

Marth: Steady, Shiida. You did
well to come find us. Altea's
bravest knights aren't about to
hand Talys to that flock of
seafowl. Come, we'll make for
the castle now!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Enemy thieves will destroy
   any villages they see.
2) Some weapons require a high
   weapon level.
3) Keep fliers away from
   archers.
4) Keep high def units in the
   front to absorb blows.
5) There's a town that is run by
   a tyrant. (West of Talys)
6) There's a mage in the village
   right south of the castle.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


The battle starts thereafter.
First, surround the thief to the
south. Then, use Marth to go
into the village and get 10000
gold.

Proceed cautiously when moving
to the west, there are a healthy
number of pirates ready to
attack you.

The healer you get in the house
south of the castle is really
not a good unit. You get a much
better healer soon, so save his
Heal for now.


NOTE: If you don't like the
following method, then you may
just proceed like normal and get
some exp for your cavaliers.
There's nothing wrong with that,
I just recommend getting a
better unit early to help for
people who are having trouble.

Now, comes the OPTIONAL part.
You can opt to abuse Gordin (or
any ranged unit) to make him
300% better than he currently
is, or you can just continue.

In order to realize Gordin's
true potential, abuse is
necessary so go ahead and have a
flier like Shiida buy 2 other
iron bows from the armory.

Give them to Gordin then have
Gordin sit two squares away from
the boss.

Attack, you should hit 4 or 6
damage. He will heal back that
amount just by sitting at his
position.

You can keep attacking until
your Gordin gets so good that he
lands a critical and kills the
boss in one shot. Easy way to
make this process faster is to
go into Options >>> Skip Enemy
Act >>> All

Every time you end your turn, it
won't show you any enemy
attacks/movements. Normally this
isn't good, since you want to
see enemy movements. However,
for this, you can spam A and
Start to speed through battles.

So anyway, enjoy the free
levels. I got my guy to lvl 10
before I landed a critical and
killed him in one shot.

Another problem that might
happen is that your speed, luck,
etc will get so good start to do
two attacks instead of only one.
This will out-damage his heal
rate. To fix this you might need
to only attack every other turn
just to let him heal.

NOTE: If you don't like this
method, then you may just
proceed like normal and get some
exp for your cavaliers. There's
nothing wrong with that.

DIALOGUE

Talys King: Ah, Prince Marth!
You have saved us in our hour of
need. Please accept my thanks.
Lad, I believe you are ready. If
you wish to seek out allies in
Aurelis, I will give you what
soldiers I can to see your
arrive there safely

Captain Ogma is a fine
swordsman, brave and true. I
know he and his fighters will
serve you well.

Another thing...During your
travels, you are certain to meet
many who despise Doluna. Some
may be hiding in villages; other
may have been captured or forced
to fight against their will or
better judgment.

It falls upon you to find these
individuals and win them over
your cause. Understood, lad?
Then go! The time has come! Be
patient, steady, strong: I know
you will do great things.

The Princes of Galder [CHP2]

"One thing could always be said
about Galder Harbor, the
mainland port nearest Talys: it
never had much in the way of
riches, but neither did it have
much trouble.

All that changed when a pirate
crew fell upon the town and made
it their hide- out. Here, in
Galder, history records Marth's
first steps toward freeing his
homeland."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Ogma: Prince Marth, I am Ogma, a
mercenary of Talys. The king has
bid me and my three men join
your army. Calvary has arrived
from the west, flying Grust's
standard. They mean to take your
life, sire. Be careful.

END DIALOGUE

--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) A pirate named Darros wants
   to join you.
2) Healing mages get exp every
   time they heal
3) Hammers beat heavy units
   (like Knights).

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


Ogma and three fighters join you
automatically. Choose between
one of the three and give all
the other two fighter's weapons
to him (I chose the higher level
3 fighter)

Then, move Marth to the front of
the bridge to the north. Darros,
a recruitable pirate is there
and he will automatically talk
to Marth. He is a OK character,
I just never found a place for
him.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Darros: Ahoy, Prince Marth, I be
Darros, a simple man o' the sea.
I've had me fill o' the piratin'
life, and now I be lookin'
t'start anew.

what say ye? Make me yer matey,
and I swear t'pull me load.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Next, use Ogma to clear the two
soldiers to the west (use his
Steel Sword) The second one will
attack you on the enemy turn and
die in the process.

Then, move your characters via
the lower-half of the map
forward.

All the above can be
accomplished in a time span of
one turn (including enemy's
turn).

Don't worry about giving exp to
Gordin, only use him on tough
enemies or if you are in a risky
position.

Starting in this battle, you
will see a glowing greenish
circle in the ground. It is
merely a save point in the
middle of the game. You can
save, then reload it if you mess
up later. Move a character onto
the circle and select Save to do
so.

Also, do note that killing
Thieves tend to give more
experience than regular enemies.
It is about 60 experience
instead of the normal 30 at the
beginning of the game.

Before, rushing, please watch
and see Castor. He is an archer
(if you refused to abuse Gordin
last chapter use him or wait
until later and get a unit like
Wolf). You must use Shiida to
recruit this character.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Shiida: Castor?! It is you,
isn't it? Must even good men
like you betray Talys now?

Castor: Princess Shiida?
Oh...I'm sorry, but me mother's
sick, and the medicine don't buy
itself, see...

Shiida: So you agreed to fight
for the pirates in exchange for
coin...All right then. If it's
gold you need, take mine. Here,
this is all I have. Take it, and
go to your mother's side.

Castor: But Princess...I
betrayed you!...Ach, I've been a
fool! Forgive me, Princess. Let
me fight for you now. Me life is
yours.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


A good Cavalier should be able
to take out a majority of the
pirates. Archers should be taken
out first though, so as to
protect Shiida.

The boss isn't anything special,
you can just team him.

Villager: You have our
gratitude, sire, for finally
chasin' those pirates away. Now,
as I hear it, you plan to march
on to Aurelis...That'll take you
right up through the Ghoul's
Teeth.

With all due respect, sire,
you're taking a great risk
crossin' those mountains That's
Soothsire territory. The
Soothsires are fearsome bandits,
always raidin' the villages and
harryin' what travelers dare
pass by.

And the swordsman with 'em- goes
by the name o' Nabarl- he's a
terror with a blade, so they
say. If you go up there, keep

"When journeying in from the
borderlands, one particular
peril would spring to mind: the
Samsooth Mountains, whose
gashing peaks rose up and
divided the peni- nsula. Since
before anyone could remember,
the mountains had belonged to
band- its, blights on the land
whose acts of plunder,
kidnapping, and arson knew no
bounds.

Out of fear, their victims gave
these peaks another name: the
Ghoul's Teeth; while the bandits
who ruled atop the Teeth's
craggy crowns took a name as
well: the Samsooth Sires, or
Soothsires..."

DIALOGUE

Julian: Hey, c'mon, Lena, shake
a leg! We need to get out of the
Teeth, and we need to do it
yesterday! Rumor has it the
knights of Altea are at the foot
of the mountain. We won't get a
better chance. It's just a
little bit farther. Stick with
me.

Lena: Julian, I'm sorry...but I
left my Mend staff back there.
It's very precious to me...You
go on ahead...Save yourself!

Here, I could use this Warp
staff to send you someplace
safe-

Julian: Uh-uh, honey. No can do.
I didn't betray my boys back
there so you could zap me on out
of here alone. Forget the staff;
I'll come back later and get it
for you myself. All right?

You finally resumed control of
your characters. First thing you
want to do is move Julian and
Lena south. Have a few ready
units to defend the area at the
bottom.

Marth needs to head to the
village. You will get a Devil
Axe there. Rest of the units
left should head left and
confront the enemy there. Shiida
is needed to recruit Nabarl, so
she must be part of the group
defending the area at the
bottom.

DIALOGUE

Shiida: Nabarl! Since when does
a swordsman of your caliber fall
in with thiev- es and
cutthroats?

Nabarl: What? Who are you? Fly
away, girl, before someone
decides to swat you.

Shiida: Please, Nabarl. Why
fight for nothing when you can
fight for something? Leave this
rabble. Lend your sword to our
cause. Or, if you will not, then
turn it on me now instead.

Nabarl: ...Nay, I'll turn no
blade of mine on a women. If
you're willing to pay for my
services with your life, then
consider yourself the high
bidder. My sword is yours.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


After a few turns worth, you
should have cleared both areas
of danger with your respective
units. The myridon, Nabarl, is
reliable and you should keep him
unless you plan on going to the
gaiden chapters.

Don't worry about his Killing
Edge breaking, he will get
another one shortly.

Battle in the Lea [CHP4]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"After a hard battle, Marth's
Altean Army- for it had grown to
be called such- set foot at
least in the kingdom of Aurelis.
However, joining his might to
that of the Aurelians would have
to wait.

As Marth descended into the vast
green lea separating his troops
from theirs, he heard a terrible
sound: the galloping of enemy
destriers, far away...then
closer...Then far too close."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Aurelis, at last...The
enemy will have sent their
forces to meet us.

Marth: Grust, Doluna, Gra..We're
up against their standing
armies, and we must brace
ourselves for it.

Malledus: Sire, I believe it
prudent that we start taking
time to prepare our troops
before each battle.

We should select the warriors
best suited for the situation
and outfit them with the right
weapons and items accordingly.

Marth: All right, that's sound
advice- I believe I'll take it.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


You will start out in a menu.
First, go to Pick Units then
choose all the units that you
have decided that you don't
like. Keep their name in grey.
It is a bad idea to meet their
unit limit in a battle, unless
it is necessary. You do not want
to have a team with balanced
exp, all struggling later.

Then, exit this part of the menu
and go to Inventory. Trade all
the items between units and then
you might want to check out the
map. You can change the
beginning spots of your troops
by simply clicking on the two.

When you are ready, saving is a
good idea. Then, hit Fight.

This battle looks intimidating
at first. However, the enemies
are easily killed Just watch
your HP of your characters and
don't leave a low def unit like
Nabarl alone.

Before the battle starts, we
have some dialogue from the
boss:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Bentheon: An unknown army to the
south? That must be the Altean
princeling and his band of
lickspittles. If they think
we'll sit by and let them join
forces with the Aurelians, then
they have another think coming.

With this ridersbane, I'll
litter the lea with their
cavalry!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Different weapons are made of
   different materials. Some are
   stronger than
others, and thus need a higher
weapon level to use.
2) Special weapons like
   armorslayer, rapier, and
   ridersbane give you a huge
advantage.
3) Don't fight this boss with a
   mounted unit (cavalier ie)
4) Keys can unlock doors and
   even bridges!
5) Dracoknights are dangerously
   strong.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------

First action you want to do is
secure the thieves so as to
ensure safety to the two
villages. Then, you want to
eliminate the small group of
enemies to the right side.

Next, take some strong units and
defeat the large group of
enemies in your way.

Watch out for Matthis, a
recruitable character, he is in
the middle of the pack Recruit
him with Lena. Dialogue is as
follows:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Lena: Matthis? Is that you?

Matthis: Lena?! What are you
doing on a battlefield?

Lena: I was attacked by bandits
in the Teeth while tending to
the sick there, and these people
saved me. The real question is,
what are YOU doing on a battle
field- least of all this one!

Matthis: I'm not here by choice,
sister of mine. Since you left,
Medon has only gotten worse and
worse.

They forced me to enlist- you
know I hate warfare, but it was
into the army or onto the
chopping block.

Lena: Shame on you, Matthis. If
you're going to fight, then at
least fight for something you
believe in. Medon has done
terrible things: marrying their
might to Doluna, helping them
torment people...Brother, it's
not too late. You could join
Altea's forces. They're good
people you know. Prince Marth
would welcome you. They all
would.

Matthis: ...All right, then. If
I'm gonna to die, I'd rather die
as one of the dashing than one
of the dastardly. You know,
Lena, you always were the
reliable one and now you're all
grown up...I thought for sure
you'd have already settled down
with your one true love.

Lena: T-true love? [lol]

I've...I've met no such man,
Matthis [oh the implications...]

Matthis: Hmm, is that so? I'll
bet you haven't... Well, you
just be careful. There are
plenty of thieves out there who
would steal a girl's heart.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Ouch, long dialogue. Anyway,
just keep going and then enter
the village to the far left to
get Merric, the powerful mage.
He has a special tome called
Exca- lilbur. It deals some
hefty damage and can only be
used by him. Merric is an
overall good character, just
watch his HP since his defence
is low.

There is a village to the right
that has 5000 gold for the
taking. Kill the healing mage
with whatever character needs
the most exp.

For the boss, just long range
him to death. Speaking of
boss...

Death Quote: "W...what...?"
--------------------------------


After this, you have a choice.
If you want, you can arena abuse
characters or you can just
continue.

Note: Using this method can get
you a level 20 Gordin going into
next chapter.

Basically, what you do is:
position a healer and your
character next to the arena.

Go into the arena and pay for
the bid. Then, silently watch
the battle. If you look to be
against the odds, quickly press
B before you die. You should
bail out safely. Most of the
time however, you will have a
marginal win over the enemies.
Just keep doing this and you can
not only make gold but you can
get much exp (for your healer
too!).

Such a technique is called
"arena abusing", a method used
to make a FE game easier. Some
people hold a grudge against it,
but then again, it might be
necessary to have your currently
weak unit become a powerhouse.

Anyway, whether you decided to
arena abuse or not, just seize
the gate.

resisted Doluna's attempts to
conquer it, but only by some
miracle. By the time Marth
arrived in Aurelis, much of its
terri- tory had already been
carved up by Doluna's ally
Medon.

Still, the king's younger
brother, Hardin, refused to give
up without a fight. The people
called him Coyote, and he

around? I'm going to take my men
east to join our might with
Marth's. Together we will retake
the castle. Stay here, my lady,
and wait for the good news.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) The castle has lots of
   treasures :) Steal them with
   Thief [the ethical
lessons for our youth...]

2) Save gold for the port map,
   it has good stuff in stores.

3) Reinforcements are gonna
   start pouring out of the
   forts.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------

Once you finally gain control of
your troops, you must notice
that your army is split into two
groups: Hardin's group and
Marth's group.

Hardin's group is going to be
hard pressed at the beginning.
Even on normal mode, the enemies
pose a challenge to some of the
weak, relatively useless
characters.


Notes about Hardin's group:

________________________________

Wolf and Sedgar, two horsemen of
Hardin's group, are two of the
best units in the game. Their
base stats are mediocre, but
their growths are amazing. A bit
of arena abuse should stimulate
their awesome power.
________________________________


Marth's groups is relatively
free, Wendell, a recruitable
sage, is in the corner of the
map. On the first turn, set up
defensive positions for Hardin's
squad (use the fort and forests)
and advance north with Marth's
squad.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Wendell: Prince Marth, I am
Wendell, a pontifex of Khadein,
city of magic. Our pleas for
peace have failed, and Khadein
has been taken over by one of
the other pontifices. His name
is Gharnef, and he and the many
mages who swear allegiance to
him have allied themselves with
Doluna.

Prince Marth, I ask you now:
please lend me your help in
thwarting his vile ambitions.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The village in the north gets
you a Firestone. Keep it, it's
important.

Once you cleared all the enemies
in the first area, which is easy
due to your sheer numbers, be
prepared for the harder task. In
the northwest corner, you should
see a lining of forts. Each
contain a spawn of enemies.

It may become messy if you allow
them to attack.

I recommend using an archer like
Gordin (or Wolf if you refused
to use the arena and grind at
Chapter 1) and two cavaliers for
the other.

Aurelis King: Prince Marth, your
arrival could not have been
better timed. Please accept our
gratitude. Princes Nyna of
Akaneia is en route from the
fortress. I am sure she will

not won yet, though: many of the
enemy continue to hold out
within the castle's halls. Stay
wary.

"After shattering Medon's main
force outside Aurelis Castle,
Marth next led his army into the
castle's halls to liberate the
kingdom. A number of treasures
slept in Aurelis Castle's nooks
and crannies but how to extract
them before they could fall into
enemy hands?

"Only a thief could open chests
locked that tight," grumbled one
of Marth's men.

"But we don't have any thieves
with us. ...Do we?""


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Emereus: What?! The rebels are
inside the castle? Grrr...Very
well! Armored units: intercept
the intruders! Archers: defend
the throne! Thieves, you go
gather up the treasure while I
make preparations to withdraw.
You have your orders! Don't let
those rebels anywhere near this
chamber!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


This battle is going to be a
fast paced battle. No time for
idling. Take your best units,
get your best weapons. For the
first half of the map, let your
strong units rush and kill the
various thieves before they run
off with the treasure.

Keep some units for the latter
part, you can afford to take
your time after. Remember to
take a thief also.

There are no houses in this map,
hence no houses section.

Start the battle when you are
done. First, do note that there
is a thief locked in the jail at
the beginning of the map. Don't
waste time on him now. He can be
recruited with Marth later
(don't worry, he isn't going
anywhere).

Rush the halls with your fastest
units, ie. Cavaliers. Back them
up with Marth, Nabarl,
Wolf/Gordin, and Merric. Make
sure that no thieves even get
close to getting away, the
treasure is really good,
especially the seraph robe.

At the bottom, near the throne,
it is pretty packed and you will
lose a char- acter if you aren't
careful. Easy way to beat it is
first, lure the units one by
one. Eliminate them then lure
another. Once you can't do that
anymore while not risking losing
a character, amass a small army.
Figure out who is going to
attack what.

For example, if I see two
archers and a knight, I would
think:

1) My mage, Merric, can easily
   take out the knight, let's
   position him to do
that.
2) Archers can't fight back in
   close range, so let's get two
   cavaliers to kill
them.

The boss is a pushover since he
doesn't have any long range
weapons. Use magic to beat him
fast.

DIALOGUE

Rickard: ...Wow! Really?! A

sprinin' me! I'm Rickard. Just a
small-time thief, mind you, but
I've got big aspirations.

I broke in here to clean the
place out, and instead it was me
that got my cloak cleaned. Since
you saved my hide, I guess the
least I can do is lend you my
services in return.

a duty I have striven to fulfill

But Doluna has laid waste to my
kingdom, and now I find myself
powerless to stop the world from
falling into ruin. Marth...
Please, pick up the banner where
I have let it fall. Lead your
might against Doluna, and free
us all.

Marth: Of course, Princess Nyna.
Altea swore fealty to Akaneia
long ago, a vow we have always
kept. And, as you know, it is in
my blood- House Altea's blood-
to destroy Medeus just as Anri
did before me.

Nyna: thank you, Marth. Then let
me give you this. This crest is
called the Fire Emblem. House
Akaneia bestows it only upon a
true champion, one we believe
has the power to save the world.

With it, you gain the right to
open treasure chests across the
land and wield the precious
items within.

I know you will use them well.
Never give up, Marth. Fight,
until the day you restore light
to our world.

"Aurelis was free, but Marth and
his army- now known as the
Akaneian League- still had much
work ahead of them. They
followed the Middleroad south,
bound for Akaneia Palace- a
perilous route, for it took them
right into Lefcandith Valley and
the jaws of trouble.

The countless fortresses lining
the valley made it a veritable
gauntlet and compounding the
danger was the presence of the
Whitewings, a knightly order led
by Princess Minerva of Medon. It
would be a fierce battle."


This battle will be relatively
hard, but it is imperative as
always not to take all your
units. After all the items from
last battle, you might need to
sort them out.

When you are ready, enter the
battle as normal.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Minerva: General Harmein, I
cannot abide by these tactics of
yours. Let me attack the rebels
head-on, and keep my pride as a
knight of Medon.

Harmein: Ah, you mean the same
pride that cost us all those
soldiers back in Aurelis? I
think not, Princess. If we're to
regroup, we need to buy time. My
tactics are necessary. The
emperor himself has named me
commander of this post.

Either obey, or accept the
consequences. Your little sister
Maria is still under our word,
is she not? What a shame it
would be, if we decided we could
no longer care for her...

Minerva: Enough! ...I will obey.
But the Altean knights are
smarter than you give them
credit for. They will prevail
here, and you will regret having
acting so rashly, General.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Minerva has a really strong
   weapon and it is decisively
   strong.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


Minerva will charge but WILL NOT
attack. You can kill the archers
around the gate, Minerva and the
fliers around her DO NOT attack
you if you get in range. (Credit
to Almightyslave)

Note that you can kill Minerva,
with an archer, though this is
unnecessary. You still can
(interestingly) recruit her
later, and killing her will make
the three other pegasus knights
fly off.

Defeat the other Pegasus Knights
(the ones that rush you) with
your archers then wait. When you
see a thief about to unlock the
gate, get Ogma or an able unit
ready. Kill him and like one or
two turns later Minerva says...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Minerva: Fine, enough! I have no
stomach for such cat-and-mouse
games. come, Whitewing! We fly!
Hyah!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Now, go and rescue the village
to get a special unit. He needs
a firestone to attack, luckily
we got one earlier. Note that
the character, name is Bantu,
cannot attack without a
firestone. I don't like him for
this reason, since you don't
even get another firestone until
Chapter 17.

Rush downward, and you are
promptly met with a solid 4
enemy reinforcement each turn.
To cover them, do as follows:

1) Shiida use Wing Spear to kill
   one.
2) Magic + Nabarl + Wolf/Gordin
   for another
3) One cavalier
4) A different cavalier.

Once they die, this map has
nothing left of a
challenge...except the boss
which can be beaten easily be a
long ranged attacker.

He also can be abused if one of
your archers can hit 1 damage
with steel bow.

Anyway...

DIALOGUE

Malledus: Prince Marth, I was
wondering if we might talk about
the Manaketes.

Marth: Manaketes? You mean the
dragonkin?

Malledus: Yes, sire. I was not
sure how much knowledge you had
of the,. The Manaketes inhabited
our continent long before the
dawn of humanity.

However, ordinarily their
raconic disposition stayed
suppressed; their power sealed
within special stones. Thus
rather than terrorizing
humankind, they chose to live
simple, peaceful lives in the
quieter reaches of the world.

However, a century ago,
something changed. Medeus, the
Shadow Dragon, surfaced in the
Doluna region and created that
would be a great empire there.
His forces invaded the human
realm, and in the blink of an
eye, he had subject- ed all of
the land.

Malledus: It was then, in that
darkest hour, that a young man
named Anri appe- ared, and rose
against the Shadow Dragon. In
his head was a shining blade of
light- Falchion- which he
plunged into Medeus- and the
tyrant was no more.

Anri went on to found Altea- and
the rest, I believe, you know.

Marth: Yes, Malledus... Is that
what this was about? I do know
my own kingdom's history. And I
know what I must do, now that
Medeus has revived and restored
Doluna to its former might.

Malledus: You are Anri's last
male descendant, the only one
who can wield Falchion. You must
find the blade that was taken,
and put an end to Doluna and its
misguided Manaketer rulers.

Marth: I will finish what my
father started. I will avenge
him, and bring light back into
our world.

END DIALOGUE

Coastal Skirmish [CHP8]

"The League had reached Akaneian
soil, so Marth gave him leave to
recuperate in Port Warren, a
harbor town known for commerce.
Coin alone kept the town free
they paid Doluna dearly in taxes
to preserve their autonomy.
Naturally, then, theirs was a
warm welcome when the Akaneian
League arrived.

Marth's soldiers were glad to
rest there, nestled between
mountain and sea but their joy
was spoiled by news that the
enemy was fast approaching- as
harsh an awakening as a rock
beneath the pillow."


This battle will be easy if you
keep your low defence characters
away. The enemy is bunched up in
masses and their reinforcements
are hard to quell all at once.
Good archers like Gordin and
Wolf are invaluable here, along
with sturdy cavaliers. Using a
knight like Draug as a blockade
isn't a bad idea neither.

Note that you will get another
knight on this map. You will
also start with two more units
from the start, a myridon and a
mercenary.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Caesar: Prince Marth, I am
Caesar, and this is Radd. We are
hired swords in the service of
Port Warren. Grust has gathered
its knights by the fortresses to
the north. It's dangerous for
you to stay here. Thankfully,
the eastern castle has been left
almost entirely unguarded;
that's the place to strike.
Please be careful, sire. We'll
be fighting with you all the
way.

--------------------------------


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Doluna is holding a princess
   of an allied nation hostage.

2) Lots of reinforcements coming
   out of the fortresses. Watch
   out.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


First of all, the two new units
you get (Caesar and Radd) are
pretty useless for this late in
the game.

Their only use in this battle is
to browse the shops/armory and
bring the valuable items to
trade to the units.

This battle has many valuable
weapons that you WILL want to
buy. Just for this section, I
will list out the items sold...


--------------------------------
SHOPS

Fire (25) - 300G
Thunder (21) - 420G
Blizzard (23) - 690G

Heal (20) - 800G
Door Key (1) - 500G
Vulnerary (3) - 360G

Iron Sword (40) - 400G
Steel Sword (35) - 875G
Silver Sword (20) - 2000G
Rapier (28) - 1120G
Iron Bow (40) - 440G

Iron Lance (40) - 380G
Steel Lance (35) - 980G
Silver Lance (20) - 2200G
Javelin (30) - 750G
Wing Spear (28) - 1120G

Iron Axe (40) - 320G
Steel Axe (35) - 700G
Hand Axe (30) - 540G
Iron Bow (40) - 440G
Steel Bow (35) - 770G


The Rapier and Wing Spear are a
one-time deal, you can only buy
one from these shops. They are
good to get along with a decent
amount of steel weapons. Silver
weapons are costly and you
should avoid them since you will
get many in drops from enemies.

END SHOPS
--------------------------------


On the first turn, advance your
units carefully. Make sure
Shiida is relatively in the
front, she is needed to recruit
the knight, Roger.

On the second turn, only move
your units forward a bit. Let
the enemies come and fight you.
Next turn, you will be just the
right distance to recruit Roger.

You have a choice now. You can
either clear the right side
first or the left side first.

The right side has more enemies.
The left side is a good way to
do something while getting your
troops over.

Eventually, you will want to
invade the right side (good
exp). A good way to do this is
to place a knight at the right
house. The archers will crowd
around trying to do damage, but
your defence should make it do
none. The horsemen will then
proceed to rush forward.

Eliminate ALL the horsemen in
one turn. Don't give them the
chance to work with the archers
to pose any unforeseen danger.

If you have chose to do the left
path before the right path,
there are three things to note:

1) Two cavaliers and one
   horsemen appear at the fort
   at Turn 10. This happens
for three turns. Be prepared, or
you risk a SERIOUS danger to
your troops.
2) A few more rounds of
   reinforcements appear at a
   much later time.
3) You can use an archer like
   Gordin to sit at the mountain
   dividing the two
sides. This will lure the two
archers to their death.

If you chose to do the right
side first, then the
reinforcements will come shortly
after you trigger enemy movement
on the left side. There are also
two sets of knights that spawn
at roughly Turn 17 (assuming you
took the right path first then
the left path).

They make for good exp for
Shiida and Merric. They are only
triggered if you step in the
proximity of the forts.

Now, for the relatively easy
part. Boss time. Note that if
you had tried to rush the boss
first, reinforcements spawn
automatically. Also note that
reinforcements pop up when you
attack him. They are limited,
but to stop them the easy way,
defeat the boss fast. Speaking
of boss...

there, too- the Pyrathi king
Mannu is said to be a descendant

Still, we've no other recourse.
We'll just have to take our

visit.

There were whispers Mannu was a

For this battle, get a thief and
your best cavalier ready for a
fast-paced battle.

Anyhow, just take normal troops
and let us continue.

HOUSES

1) A chest holding a Wyrmslayer
   is in the eastern fortress.
   It is powerful in
destroying a Manakete.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


The south side near the boss is
infested with enemies. There are
reinf- orcements spawning in the
lower forts frequently. A thief
threatens the village in the
north and must be dealt with
ASAP.

First thing you need to do is
move Shiida and Marth as far
right/north as poss- ible! It
will take some extremely fast
movements to save the
village/another character.

If you find that Shiida is just
too far away to kill the first
thief, then plant her at the
village entrance. She will make
sure the village is safe.

At the village, you get...a
sniper, Jeorge. Hehe, both
Gordin and Wolf should easily
top his stats right now.

The boss is a pushover as
normal, my Wolf could destroy
him in one attack. Of course, my
other units could have beat him
in roughly two attacks. I mean,
c'mon, 23 HP only?

You probably defeated the boss
before the rest of the enemies,
well at least I did. To finish
up the map, just kill all the
thieves with Shiida and watch
the hunters. Then, route them
with your cavaliers. Easy map.
Seize the gate when you're

insisted her plea was a ruse, a
trap concocted by Princess
Minerva herself Marth doubted
that, though; he had seen the
woman in Lefcandith Valley, and
she did not strike him as a sort
of conniving menace his
followers feared. As the brunt
of Grust's might drew closer,
Marth led the League to Castle
Deil, deter- mined to attack the
citadel and rescue the young
Medonian princess, Maria."

DIALOGUE

Zharov: Princess Minerva, what
brings you here? You've left
your post: not very wise. Might
I remind you, poor conduct on
your part could have
repercussions on
how...comfortable...your sister
remains.

Minerva: I am aware of my
sister, thank you. ...I did not
come to make trouble. Just let
me see Maria, for a little
while. She's only a child,
General. Think of what she must
be going through0

Zharov: Impossible, I'm afraid.
She is a hostage. If your
sister's well-being concerns
you, then start following
orders.

(Enemy soldier enters)

Enemy soldier: General! Grave
news! The rebel army has been
sighted east of Castle Deil!

Zharov: What?! Why in creation
would the rebels come here?
Blast...Order the Dragoons to
sortie! And don't forget to send
word to the main army. We need
reinforcements!

has arrived...

HOUSES

1) Three great people that once
   lived: Miloah (master of
   Aura), Gharnef (master
of Dark Pontifex), and Gotoh

2) Minerva is a good person,
   pressured by her sister being
   threatened.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


First things first, you will
want to make for the fortress.
Not only does it contain Maria,
the prisoner, it is a good place
to hold a position against the
reinforcements. The enemy thief
will take an item from the
chest. Make sure to kill him as
fast as possible to regain it.

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU SAVE
MARIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Minerva will not join you until
you save her. Really, just go
save her then move Marth back to
recru- it Minerva.

Here is Maria's dialogue:

--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Maria: Oh! You must be Prince
Marth! (My, he's so dashing!)
...Thank you for rescuing me.
Please be sure to tell my sister
I am free. She'll be grateful
for the news. Now then. Shall we
be off? I'm coming with you, of
course.

...No protesting! I wish to
help!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Wolf or some strong units (maybe
Shiida if she is high level
enough) can take the left side
around and kill the enemy
fliers.

The main army will spawn in
around the time you rescue Maria
(if you rushed as fast as
possible to her jail cell that
is). Minerva will follow them.
You don't have to worry about
Minerva attacking your troops,
just position your troops in
this way to defeat the horde of
enemies:

LEGEND

o = Wall
R = Your ranged units
P = Your physical units
H = Your healer
M = Marth
E = Enemies
   oooooooooo
 H    o
 M PP  o
 RoE ooo
 RoEoo
ooooooooEo
 EEE

I would suggest Gordin and
Merric to be the ranged units.
High defence units like a knight
or a cavalier should be the
physical. Lena is the healer.

Anyway, just wait until it's
like only one unit before
Minerva, then move in Marth.
Kill the unit in front of you
and Minerva will automatically
talk to Marth...though you must
have rescued Maria first (that
is partially the reason why you
should hold a position like
this, you need to move Marth all
the way from the jail to the
south entrance)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Minerva: Greetings, Prince
Marth. I am Minerva of Medon.
Thank you for saving my sister.
Maria's plight forced me to
treat you as an enemy when I
knew you were not; suffice to
say, I am deeply sorry for that.

...The whole world has gone mad.
Most of Medon fights for Doluna
now. My own brother Michalis
leads them. And on their hands
is the blood of their king, my
father. They must be stopped; I
must stop them.

Still, I fear for my soldiers
whom I can no longer protect,
especially the thr- ee Whitewing
sisters: Palla, Catria, and Est.
Doluna worried we would rebel,
and forced us to separate. If
they knew I was safe, they would
join your ranks in a heartbeat.
We are yours to command, sire.
Let us help you defeat Doluna,
and repay them for sullying
Medon's honor.

of Pontifex Miloah?

Marth: The one who defended
Akaneia with the power of Aura?
Of course; he and his magic are
famous! But...I read Miloah died
in a battle with Gharnef, soon
after the fiend sold is soul to
Doluna...

Nyna: Alas, Miloah did die...
But his daughter, Linde, yet
lives. I am told she inherited
her father's skill with Aura
magic- but since the battle with
Gharnef none have seen her.

Wherever she is, it cannot be
pleasant. ...Marth, please. Find
Linde. With her father gone, we
are the only family the girl has
left.

"Tired from so many long
battles, Marth and the League
arrive at last in Akan- eia,
Princess Nyna's mother kingdom.
Past the mountains lay the royal
palace, known to some as
Millennium Court; and within its
walls awaited many treasures and
captives the enemy had taken.

With each step, Marth draw
nearer to one of the great
waypoints on his journey"


Do the normal, pick your units
and trade the unnecessary items.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Nyna, soon the palace
will be in sight. I...know this
can't be easy for you.

Nyna: ...When the palace fell,
many, many good Akaneians were
killed. The royal family...My
family were...Their bodies were
hung before the gates as an
example I cannot unpaint that
vivid picture, of my parents
grotesquely changed...I feel as
though I should cry, Marth; or
scream. But no tears come, and I
cannot chase away the sadness
and rage...

...I cannot change the past. I
can only shape the future. Lead
the way, Marth. I am ready. Take
me home.

First thing to do is press X.
The huge range from the enemy
ballistas covers a few of your
units. The ballistas are
stationary, but they will attack
your units nevertheless. They
pack quite a punch and they
should be avoided when possible.

There are a few things you
should take care of:

A) Send a flier past the
mountains to the right and
attack. All the enemies should
attack him/her and die. B) Leave
an archer to take care of the
immediate Pegasus Knight threat
from the north. C) Move the rest
of your units forward between
the mountains, keep in mind the
X button enemy attack range.

The southeast region is filled
with houses and a few shops.
That calls for...

VISIT THE HOUSE #6 (it's the one

HOUSES

1) The shops/armory has rare
   goods.

2) Some citizens are being held
   hostage

3) There are three legendary
   weapons that have been passed
   down.

4) War sickens her.

5) Ballistas are far-ranged
   units that can destroy fliers
   fast.

6) Jake is a good person :). Try

IT IS IMPORTANT TO VISIT THE
HOUSE #6 (it's the one to the
west bordering the lake) (Credit
goes to LordRasler and
DemonicDratini)

Visit the village on the corner
of the map to get...Linde.

Charge the first ballista (in
the north). You shouldn't take
too much damage if you used
units like cavaliers. Quickly
wipe out the ballistian, keep a
wary eye on the sniper that has
a killer bow.

After, make sure you eliminate
Khozen. HE CANNOT BE RECRUITED.
For this sake, he is like a
mini-boss, so I have chosen to
add him as one...


--------------------------------
Boss: Khozen
HP: 23

Weapon: Firestone
Drop: Energy Drop

Beginning Quote: "Burn...! Burn,
till your blood boils and your
flesh cooks!

Death Quote: "Emperor Medeus...I
have failed you..."

--------------------------------


Keep moving along and note that
the boss IS recruitable IF and
ONLY IF you have visited the
house with Anna in it. You need
Shiida to recruit him so be
prepared.

Some users have been concerned
with just how to recruit Jake,
there are a number of ways:

1) Place a strong unit like a
   cavalier on the fort and
   allow the boss to run
out of arrowspatte. Then,
recruit. Problem with this is
that you might want the weapon
(it is useful).

2) Have Shiida class changed
   beforehand so the arrowspatte
   won't be effective.
Problem is that you have to
restart the chapter pretty much.

3) Use a mid-chapter save point
   then turn it off and try
   again if Shiida dies.
Recommended method, with only
drawback being time consuming.


--------------------------------
Boss: Jake
HP: 20

Weapon: Arrowspatte
Drop: None

Beginning Quote: "I knew I
wasn't cut out for the military.
Well, too late now. I just hope
Anna's OK."

Death Quote: Instead of a death
quote, you can recruit this
unit. In it's place I present
the conversation...


Shiida: Hail, ballistican of
Grust! Are you the one they call
Jake?

Jake: Hail yourself, sugar!
What's a fetching lass like you
doing out here on the
battlefield? And how do you know
my name?

Shiida: I am Shiida of Talys. An
Akaneian woman by the name of
Anna told me about you.

Jake: Really? Anna mentioned me?
...In a good way, right?

Shiida: She's very worried about
you. She wants to know why such
a good man is fighting for the
wrong side.

Jake: Wrong side? Hmm... Well, I
have to admit, I'm not too keen
on kicking Akaneia while they're
down...

Shiida: They why not fight for
Akaneia instead? Help us defeat
Grust and Doluna , and set the
world right.

Jake: Well...I don't know. I
don't think it's that simple...
Hmm...

Shiida: Anna would love you for
it, I'm sure.

Jake: She would? Hmmm... All
right, you win. But I'm doin' it
for Anna- just to be clear!

--------------------------------


I WOULD NOT use Jake. You get a
better similar-class unit later,
so keep his weapon until then.

Before you seize the gate, you
might want to consider buying
stuff in the shops and in using
the arena to train a bit.

Anyway, seize the gate whenever
you feel like it.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Good news, Nyna! We've
wrested control of the gates
from the enemy.

Nyna: Then...we've won!

Marth: Not quite yet. We can
enter the palace, but Doluna
still holds strong inside her
walls. Also, a number of knights
are being held captive inside.

Nyna: Loyal soldiers who fought
for their kingdom and their
people...Marth, I wish to free
them as soon as possible.

Marth: I understand. We should
strike now, then, before enemy
reinforcements can arrive. I
believe we have a good chance.

Nyna: Thank you, Marth. As
always, I am counting on you.
Worry no more.

The Ageless Palace [CHP12]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


"The holy kingdom of Akaneia had
come into being six centuries
earlier, when the region's
numerous city-states were
unified under one monarch. The
first king, Adrah, had fought
valiantly to accomplish this,
wielding the three weapons he
came to call his regalia- gifts
from the gods, some said.

The kingdom Adrah forged was
pronounced holy; its kings were
esteemed. With Akaneia's aid,
six more independent kingdoms
sprang up in their own time. But
Akaneia was always the greatest-
and now, Marth was about to take
his first walk through its
historic palace's halls."


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Midia: Bishop, what do you make
of this? I hear shouting in the
corridors. Hmm...Princess Nyna
must have returned with an army
in tow. An army?! Really? Then
we are saved!

Bishop: Saved, perhaps...or
doomed. Surely the enemy
realizes we are more trouble
alive than dead now.

Midia: You do not take my
meaning, Bishop. By "we" I mean
Akaneia. Akaneia is saved. If
Princess Nyna has truly come to
chase the enemy from our halls,
to free us...Then my death will
have meaning.

Bishop: Ho ho...I admire your
spirit, child. I always have.
But think how Ast- ram would
grieve if you were to die.

Midia: I...I had hoped to see
him one last time- to say
goodbye. That alone I regret.

Bishop: Ah, but you have not
died yet. Midia. Hang on to
hope.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


First things first, you will
need to rush the prison if you
hope to save all the hostages
alive. Rush forward, don't leave
any regrets behind. Send some
weaker units to dispatch the two
thieves on the side, and
overall, don't leave your units
in a discoordinated position,
reinforcements will attack your
rear.

In fact, they appear at the
beginning of Turn 3, so make
sure your back is covered.

This map is easy after you save
the prisoners, the rest of the
enemies can be defeated with one
or two good units, like a
cavalier.

There is free experience to the
enemies that spawn outside. Good
for leveling up lower level
units.

Grab all the treasures, be sure
to not miss the one outside to
the right of the throne.

Speaking of the throne, let's go

seize the gate.

DIALOGUE

Nyna: Marth, thank you. Were it
not for you, I may never have
seen the halls of my house
again.

Marth: I could not have done it
alone, Nyna. The whole Akaneian
League fought tooth and nail
this day.

Nyna: True, and yet all the
same... I have little doubt your
exploits are the ones that will
live on in song.

I have a gift for you, to
celebrate your achievements
here. This bow is called
Parthia. It is one of the three
regalia that have been passed
down through House Akaneia. The
other two regalia- the sword
Mercurius and the lance Gradiv-
us are not here. The enemy took
them when they fled. I am sorry.
I had hoped to give you all
three, and thus aid you in the
battles to come....

Marth: Your concern for me is
more than enough, Nyna. One day,
I will get your family's
treasures back and use them to
crush Doluna. I swear it on this
emblem of fire!

"The Akaneian heroes hurried in
Altea, but they would not go
unchallenged. Waiting for them
at Fort Menedy were Grust's
artillery regiment, the dreaded
"Wooden Cavalry." Missiles
crashed down, rocking the earth
as the enemy ballistae rumbled
forward. Had Marth and the
League any hope of triumphing
over such firepower?"


First of all, MAKE SURE YOU
SELECT MIDIA (Paladin) as one of
your characters. She is
necessary to recruit a character
in this chapter.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Nyna: Grust's artillery...Our
opponent is mighty.

Marth: Nonetheless we must face
them head-on; they stand between
us and Altea.

Nyna: That hunger for danger
worries me, Marth. Humanity's
hopes rest on your shoulders. I
would sooner not see them
crushed.

Marth: Which? Humanity's hopes,
or my shoulders? ...Have a
little faith, Nyna. The enemy
ballisticans can strike from
afar, but they're powerless up
close.

All we need to do is move in and
silence them before they do too
much damage. Watch!

--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Thunderbolt is super
   effective [in PokeMon terms
   :P] against ballistas.
Other than that, just go close
range to win.
2) Everyone wants you to win
   this battle...[of course?]

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


These are main things to do here
(in no particular order and some
are described more in detail
later).

A) Recruit Astram with Midia
(Make sure to cover all the
flanks and keep her healed.
Personally, I forgot to kill the
lower three ballistas on my
first run)

NOTE: Astram is weird in that he
WON'T talk to Midia if you sit
her in his attack range, he goes
aheads and attacks/kills her.
You must use an archer or a safe
unit to lure him in then talk to
him. Don't make the same mistake
as I did :).

B) Visit the village to recruit
Beck. C) Defeat the two upper
units with regular attack units
like Ogma and Wolf. D) Use Beck
to destroy most of the ballistas
in the middle. Then, move in and
defeat the remaining units. E)
Kill the boss, Beck can do this
alone. F) Visit the houses (see
above) for exact details)

Backtracking so I can get the
dialogue:

When you enter the village...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Beck: Prince Marth, I presume?
The name's Beck. I fought in the
battle at Castle Deil. After my
shameful defeat there, see, I
took refuge in this villag- e.
And when I heard your army was
marchin' this way, I readied my
ballista, hopin' for another
taste of battle.

So how 'bout it, princey? Take
me along! I'm packin'
thunderbolts, see? The enemy
ballisticans'll never know what
hit 'em!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Beck moves one forest square at
a time, but his incredible range
let's him destroy. He is sorta
stuck moving horizontally along
the small strip.

Leave your other units to wait
and let him take out most of the
ballistas. Watch out for the
boss, but even he too can be
destroyed by Beck.

By now, the main path should be
clear enough to go ahead and
recruit Astram. You need Midia
to recruit him.

NOTE: Astram is weird in that he
WON'T talk to Midia if you sit
her in his attack range, he goes
ahead and attacks/kills her. You
must use an archer or a safe
unit to lure him in then talk to
him. Don't make the same mistake
as I did :).

NOTENOTE: Ballistas are truly
hapless when in close range.
Just sink in like two squares
away and they are powerless.

Here is the conversation...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Midia: Hello, my lover.

Astram: Midia...? Midia, my
sweet! Can it really be you? I
feared you were dead

Midia: Oh, Astram! How could you
not have heard? Akaneia is free!
The Altean army came, and
liberated the palace along with
all the hostages within! Now we
fight as one.

Come with us, Astram! You
needn't dance to Doluna's fiddle
any longer.

Astra: I've a mind to break
their fiddle, for all the evils
they have wrought..

Midia: Now you can. We can take
them together.

Astram: That we can. ...Midia. I
am sorry I left you alone. I
will not make that mistake
again.

Midia: No, you certainly won't.
Now that I have you
back...you'll find me
exceedingly reluctant to let you
go.

Astram: Ooh... Yes, I can see
that! Just take care you don't
crush me instead of Doluna!

DIALOGUE

Nyna: Spectacularly done, Marth.
...Does something ail you? I
thought you would be happier.

Marth: Today, there was this
commoner... She mentioned Grust
was divided about the war. Some
of its people wanted to fight
with Altea, she said...Ever
since I lost my father and
kingdom, I've held nothing but
hate in my heart for Gra and
Grust...but not once did I give
any thought to what must have
been going on in their heads.

Nyna: And now you find your hate
for them has been lessened?

Marth: No... the hate remains. I
will never forget the pain they
inflicted upon me, the rage I
felt. Yet now, at least, I can
tell you it's not just
hate...Not anymore.

Nyna: Not all evils are wrought
of evil purposes. Perhaps this
sounds naive, but...A true
leader needs to look at his
opponent and see more than just
an enemy.

Marth: ....

"Gra's betrayal of Altea years
earlier had come as a shock, of
course, until that day they
attack Marth's kingdom in the
name of Doluna, Gra had been a
trustworthy neightbor and ally.
While the Altean army was out on
an expedition, Gra struck from
the rearm annihilating the
Altean soldiers, killing Marth's
father, King Cornelius and
stealing Falchion, the blade of
light. It was a crushing blow.

Much time had passed since that
sad day, and much had changed.
Now it was Marth's turn to
descend on Gra Bastion, and face
King Jiol, the man who had
robbed him of his father."


Before starting, you may want to
consider using a Master Seal on
your stronger units. Note that
the ideal level to class upgrade
is 20, but this isn't practical
nor is it that useful. Class
upgrading at the level of 15-18
is good enough. Having said
this, if you can level up to 20
before this, then by all means
do so.

You should have three promoted
units. Most promoted units, with
the exception of maybe the
Paladin and the Bishop, can
cross the water, which is an
extremely useful ability to have
in this battle. Note also that
Marth can cross the river too.

I would advise against using
Astram, whom you got last
battle. Stick to your old party
and then start the battle. I
WOULD advise taking Beck just to
kill the first enemy and maybe
pick some other units off.

Give Beck the Arrowspatte from
Jake. Also be sure to give a
master key to one of your units
that can cross the river (like
Shiida).


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy Soldier: King Jiol,
they're 'ere! The League is
outside the Bastion!

Jiol: League? How dare you call
them that! I see naught but a
prince of ghosts and his pack of
rebels.

Enemy Soldier: B-beggin' your
pardon, sire, but everybody
calls 'em the League now. Altea
and Aurelis and Akaneia...The
League of A's, you might say!

Jiol: Shut up, you idiot!
Hmmm...So the princeling has
returned. And he leads all the
might of Akaneia, with the Fire
Emblem in hand...Did you send to
Doluna for reinforcements like I
asked?

Enemy Soldier: Of course, sire.
Medon's pegasus knights are on
their way.

Jiol: Pegasus knights?! How am I
supposed to stop the Lea- those
REBELS with a handful of...of
winged ponies! Send another
messenger! Tell them we need
Camus's Sable Order, or...or
Michalis's Dragoons!

Blast...I deserve the same
protection as the rest of the
Empire! Betraying Altean was
Gharnef's idea! Let...let him
fight the brat! Don't just stand
there, DO something! I don't
want to die! [Too bad]

1) After level 10, a unit can be
   promoted.
2) With a silver card (which you
   get in this chapter), you can

half price.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


At the start of the battle, use
Beck to use Thunderbolt to kill
the first ballista. You should
get another useful ballista
weapon. Next, use your promot-
ed units to cross the river. 2-3
of them suffice.

The left fortress is held very
tightly by a group of archers.
They are a tough group to kill,
some of the archers carry
longbows allowing them to pile
on your units. The house on the
island is relatively safe, the
thieves are more worried about
getting the treasure at the
southeast corner.

Of course, using a strong unit
like Wolf, you can eliminate all
the archers. You could do that,
or you can let your units get
exp off them (go around them via
the river and kill them). Also
note that Beck can attack the
archers.

Before turn 5 starts, two
recruitable pegasus knights will
appear. They can be recruited by
using Marth. Both pegasus knight
will automatically talk to
Marth.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Catria: Hail, Prince Marth! 'Tis
me, Catria. We meet again. My
elder sister and I heard our
mistress, Princess Minerva, had
joined your ranks so we
absconded from Medon to come and
look for you here. I will fight
my hardest for you, sire You
need only give the command.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Palla: Greetings, Prince Marth.
I am Palla, of the Whitewinged
Order of Medon. My younger
sister and I parted ways with
Medon the moment we heard
Princess Maria was free. Until
now, we had fought for Doluna
against our will- but no longer.

You have freed us to do what our
hearts tell us is right. I wish
to fight with my mistress,
Princess Minerva. My lance is
hers, and yours. Still, sire, I
fear for my youngest sister,
Est. She flew to Grust some time
ago and has yet to return.

If the three of us- Catra, Est,
and I- are reunited, we can
serve you all the better. I hope
Est is safe.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


If you, the reader, didn't like
using Shiida for some reason,
these two are a good
alternative. For now, just leave
the two alone and give the rest
of your units the experience.

About turn 8, about right after
you recruit the two pegasus
knights, more enem- ies appear.
They are relatively easy and I
like using Beck's arrowspatte to
get rid of them. This is also
good experience for low level
units, you can use Beck
(arrowspatte) and Lena (physic)
to backup the unit.

Use the master key to open the
door and two chests at the
southeast corner. One chest
contains the ever important
Silver Card (halves prices at
shop) and a Bullion (S).

At turn 16, the reinforcements
of seemingly endless pegasus
knights end.

????: You must be Prince Marth

of you. This magic tome belongs
to Bishop Boah of Akaneia.
General Volzhin of Doluna has
been keeping it stashed away,
but it...found its way into my
hands, you might say.

I would appreciate greatly if
you could return it to the good
bishop in my stead. One other
thing... Please take care of

take back your home.

Marth: Yes, and take it back I
shall, but...

Nyna: Something is wrong. What
troubles you?

Marth: Falchion isn't here.

Nyna: The divine blade? Was it
supposed to be?

Marth: Yes. When one of my
knights returned from the battle
where my father, Cornelius,
fell....he said Gra had stolen
Falchion. And if we are to
defeat Doluna and the Shadow
Dragon, Medeus...we need that
blade.

(Enter Malledus)

Malledus: Prince Marth!

Marth: Did you find it,
Malledus?

Malledus: No...it seems Gharnef
made off with it.

Nyna: Gharnef? Then, to find
Falchion-

Marth: That's right. We'll need
to go to Khadein, the kingdom of
magic, where he resides. It
pains me to turn astray when
Altea is so close, but it must
be done.

"Khadein, city of magic. Ever
since Gharnef named himself
ruler of this mecca for the
magically inclined, the sands
surrounding it had run red. Many
knights had tried to oust
Gharnef, but what defense did
they have against the mages the
fiend had bent to his purpose?
One by one the heroes fell to
blades unseen and fires within
their armor; and it was not long
at all before Khadein's wicked-
ness outstripped its wisdom."


Not too many comments to write
about this battle's
preparations, just remember that
faster units are key in this
map. A thief is necessary also.

When the battle starts, we zoom
to Gharnef's reflections.

DIALOGUE

Gharnef: What? The dregs of
Akaneia have come to challenge
my kingdom? Ha ha ha... Really,
do they think people have not
tried before? So long as I
possess this Imhullu magic, they
cannot snuff my life out. No one
can. As for the White Sage... He
will trouble me no longer. With
the dragon-goddess right where I
want her, in the Fane of Raman,
there is no way for Gotoh's
Starlight to disp- erse the
shadows that guard me.

HOUSES

1) Gharnef is invincible and can
   only be defeated by the White
   Sage's powers.

2) You need a barrier staff to
   protect you from magic. Also,
   Gharnef might be
leaving soon, so if he attacks
you, just "ride it out".

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


DO NOTE THAT GHARNEF IS
INVINCIBLE. Not even the
strongest of units can kill him.
You must wait until the end of
turn 6 and he will decide to
leave.

HE WILL ATTACK YOU if he gets a
chance. When he does so, he will
go into dialogue first...

Gharnef: You dare oppose me,
fool? You must not value your
life. Cower before the might of
the magic Imhullu: once
forbidden, now unleashed!

END DIALOGUE

Before he reaches the middle
island, charge with a mass of
units forward. The mages have
low defence and can give good
experience. Just watch for the
damage, it accumulates fast.
Also use an archer to destroy
the dracoknights that attack
they are relatively strong.

Anyhow, don't let Gharnef be
able to attack any units. All
units that can move fast, go
north and fight there.

Any unit that cannot, move them
to the southwest corner of the
map.

At turn 6, Gharnef will say...

DIALOGUE

Gharnef: Altean prince! I fear
you are not quite imposing
enough to warrant my staying
here. But if it's Falchion you
want, come and take it. I shall
be wait- ing at the Temple of
Thabes.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


With that, he teleports off. Yay
for us. There are really no more
bosses left, the guy guarding
the castle is just normal.
However, his attack is a far
ranged one and can do some hefty
damage. Keep a healer using
Physic, or Mend depending if
she/he is strong enough to
withstand some attacks.

The rest of the map is an
experience spree. Bring your
thief to the lower right corner
to take some treasures.

The boss should be dead and the
reinforcements should be running
thin at turn 15 or so. Then,
comes the interesting part.

In a few Fire Emblem games,
there is a sand level like this
one. They tend to have items
HIDDEN underneath the level.
HOWEVER, I have checked this
level for the most part and
haven't found anything
interesting.

If you find anything hidden in
the sand, please contact me and
you will be added to this list.

Treasures from the southeast
corner include:

1) Energy Drop
2) Tailsman


Seize the gate when done...easy
chapter except for Gharnef, eh?


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: No Falchion...The battle
was for naught.

Gotoh: ...Marth...Prince Marth.

Marth: Huh? Who are you?!

Gotoh: My name is Gotoh...I am
speaking to you from Medon
through magic.

Marth: Gotoh...the White Sage?

Gotoh: Some have used that name,
yes. You must listen to me. As
you suspect, Gharnef has made
off with Falchion. With Imhullu
and Falchion in the sorcerer's
grasp, Doluna now must think
twice before challenging him.
Gharnef knows this. And one day,
he plans to conquer Doluna and
rule the entire world.

Marth: Is Imhullu so powerful a
magic, then?

Gotoh: Yes. The mage who wields
it cannot be killed; cannot be
so much as scratched. I was the
magic's guardian once. Knowing
its forbidden power could work
terrible evils, I kept it close.
But Gharnef, one of my two
pupils- Miloah being the other-
took the forbidden tome and
vanished. Now you are paying for
my carelessness. Forgive me. I
wish to make amends by teaching
you the only way to undo
Imhullu's power.

Marth: Which is...?

Gotoh: It is called Starlight.
One blast is enough to break
through Imhullu's shadowy
protection. But to cast the
magic, you need two orbs: the
Lightsphere and the Starsphere.
Heed me, Marth. When you find
the Lightsphere and Star-
sphere, bring them to me. Then I
will give you the magic you
seek. Then you will have
Starlight, and with it,
Gharnef's reign will end.

The Battle for Altea [CHP16]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


"Still smarting from their
bitter experience with Gharnef
and the dark magic Imhullu,
Prince Marth and the League
regrouped and march south- home
to Altea. Once Marth's kingdom
had been beautiful, blessed with
rich soil and clear waters; now
the eyes tended to notice
instead the barren farms; the
ruins; forlorn stares. Marth
vowed to free Altea from its
torment without any further
delay."


Pick your best units as normal,
trade around units and get ready
for some fighting.

Start the battle and start
moving...but wait! First...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Nyna: You've done it, Marth.
We're here. That's Altea beneath
our feet- your home.

Marth: Countless days have
passed since Doluna took my
kingdom from me- days I would
never have lived had it not been
for my sister Elice's sacrifice,
and the sacrifices of so many
others...

Nyna: What became of your
sister? And the rest of your
family, what of them as well?

Marth: My father, as you know,
died in Gra. I last saw my
mother and sister the day the
castle fell. I do not know if
they still live...but I hope
that they do

And if the enemy has them, I
will rescue them. You can be
sure of that.

(Enter Malledus)

Malledus: Sire, our preparations
are complete. We are ready to
march.

Marth: Thank you.

(Marth moves to address your
group)

Marth: Alteans and friends of
the League! Join me now! Help me
set Altea free, and ensure
today's is the last battle my
people must endure!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


There are many houses in the
area...and naturally...


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) You can only choose between
   one of the two characters
   from the village, the
paladin or the hero.

2) VIP card grants you access to
   secret shops, whose location
   is...secret.

3) Xane, a recruitable
   character, is locked up and
   has some power, he's not
sure [oh, the gossip of today!]

4) The orbs are enshrined at
   this place...the orbs are
   mysteriously powerful.

5) House citizen says, "YAY!" to
   Altean army.

6) Devil sword might kill you
   instead of your enemy...

7) Elisa, the princess, was
   teleported somewhere instead
   of killed.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


Now that is out of the way, we
can finally get to the real part
of the guide. Leave a group of
units to deal with the few
immediate threats, then move
Marth and about three other
strong units to the left.

When you get to the villages,
PAY ATTENTION! You can only get
one of the two units here. There
is a choice between a paladin
(to the left) and the hero (to
the right). I personally like
Heroes better so I chose that.

Then again, I don't recommend
using these pre-promoted units,
just pick one.

Here is Samson's (the hero)
dialogue:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Samson: My name is Samson. Once,
I was a swordfighter of some
renown...but that was then, and
this is now. I'm happy enough
with my life here in the
village, but if you need another
man, I will fight.
Unfortunately, there has always
been bad blood between our
village and the next one over.
They'll have closed the gates to
you the moment they saw you come
here. Guess that means the
paladin Arran won't be fightin'
with you. Them's the breaks.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Here is Arran's (the Paladin)
dialogue: (CREDIT GOES TO
SuperArc)

--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Arran: Sire, my name is Arran.
Once I was a captain to many
knights... but, things change,
and I came to live here in this
village. If you need warriors
for the coming struggle, I would
be honored to fight.
Unfortunately, there has always
been bad blood between this
village and our neighbors. No
doubt they closed their gates to
you as soon as they saw you come
here. You won't be able to
recruit the hero Samson now, I'm
afraid.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Anyhow, keep moving your units
to the left. You can consider
using Beck the ballista to
attack the units in the middle
island.

At the end of turn 10, leave no
unit alone in the area of the
villages. Enemy reinforcements
appear in the four forts above.
I would recommend having split
your party in two:

1) The mass of your army is
   still sitting at your base.
2) Marth and 3-4 others are near
   the castle (but I wouldn't
   attack just yet,
let the reinforcements run out)

Let the four reinforcements
charge toward the main part of
your army. They should die
relatively fast.

Two reinforcements should attack
your small army. They also
should die fast. I would
recommend staying put and
waiting until the enemies stop
coming in (a little less than
Turn 20 - note that they come
every 2-3 turns)

Barge into the jail on the east
and talk to Xane with Marth...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Xane: Hey there, princey. Thanks
for settin' me free! The name's
Xane. I hail from a land few
have heard of an even fewer have
seen. I won't trouble you with
the details. Me and my folk have
the power to transform into
other people. We can shape-
shift, you see. When Doluna
caught on, they started
threatenin' me. Told me to join
their army or "face my doom."
Hah!

Well, I wasn't about to waste my
considerable talent on those
evil coots! You, on the other
hand...You've got character.
Say, why don't we team up? I do
owe you for savin' my hide. And
I think you'll find my consider
talents are...quite
considerable.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Let me explain what Xane does:
he can transform into an ally
unit and have their abilities,
stats, levels, class,
everything! After a few turns he
will go back to his old self,
but he is useful if you have a
favorite character that you want
to "duplicate".

Xane is his own special class:
the Chameleon. Note: Only thing
he doesn't duplicate are the
weapons and current experience.


(Xane's class is called
"Freelancer" in the American
version)


Now, all units but the boss
should be out. Let us go,
proceed with caution as the boss
is dangerous.


--------------------------------
Boss: Hollstadt
HP: 37

Weapon: Killer Lance + Killer
Bow Drop: Dracoshield

Beginning Quote: "Well done,
rabble. Anyone else would be
dead by now. A shame you must
end your campaign right here,
before your own gates!"

Death Quote: "Rrgh! General
Camus... The rest...is in
your...hands..."

--------------------------------


After this, feel free to use the
arena to level up a bit. Also
note that you have should put
the master seal you got this
level to good use.

When done, seize the gate.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Well done, sire! The
enemy has ceased their
resistance. Victory is ours!

(Nyna enters)

Nyna: Bravo, Marth. On behalf of
House Akaneia, I wish to extend
my heartfelt congratulations.

Marth: Thank you, Nyna. But it's
still too soon to celebrate. We
haven't freed the castle yet.

Malledus: Sire, your soldiers
have assembled for the castle
raid. Perhaps you could say a
few words first...

(Malledus backs off and let's
Marth address the soldiers)

Marth: Altean warriors... Brave
comrades. The road has been
long, but at last we have driven
Doluna from my homeland. There
are not words to express my
gratitude to you all. You gave
Altea back to me. Thank
you...Thank you.

...An army of foes still haunt
my castle. I mean to kick them
out. Ready, my friends? Let's
send these varlets scurrying!

END DIALOGUE

Star and Savior [CHP17]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"The League had routed
Hollstadt's knights and
recaptuerd most of the kingdom,
but there was still the castle
to deal with before Altea would
be free; the mage-dragon Morzas
remained entrenched within its
walls. Unlike General Camus who
preceded him, Morzas had been a
cruel warden, slaughtering many
innocent Alteans at the
slightest provocation. Marth
roiled to think such a monster
still sat upon his noble
father's throne."


Pick your favorite units, Beck
might be a good choice also.
Nothing much to do, promote some
units if possible. Use some
items. Trade some stuff. When
ready, start. A thief also helps
good.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Morzas: Kee hee hee...Wretched
Altean whelp, stumbling home to
the slaughter... What fool
throws away a life already so
preciously bought? Your mother,
Liza, is dead; I killed her
myself. Your sister Elice likes
only because Gharnef wanted her.
So what will become of you,
little prince? Will you run for
your life a second time? Or will
you stay this time to die?
Emperor Medeus would not put me
on this throne if he thought you
could remove me from it, kee hee
hee...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The beginning part of this stage
should look familiar...it's from
the Prologue!

Anyhow, your first target are
the treasure chests to the left.
Let's use some strong units to
get there. Leave some units
around. Beck is also useful here
because he can attack the
thieves from the start.

Note that the bishop to the
right will spam fortify whenever
any enemy units are damaged even
the slightest bit.

Use your strongest units to
defeat the Manaketes and use
your others to defeat the
regular enemies. By the time you
reach the treasure room, Beck
should have cleared the place.
Note that you should NOT have
started fighting in the eastern
part of the map.

However, the ENTIRE left side
should be cleared. Your thief
should be rushing in and getting
the treasures. Here are all the
treasures in a list:

1) Warp
2) Killer Bow
3) Dracoshield
4) Master Seal
5) Devil Sword
6) Silver Axe
7) Secret Book

After this, take the time to
mobilize all your troops to the
right. Then, use an archer to
take out the ranged
bishops/archer on the extreme
right. (Note: you should get a
VIP card...refer to [4D] for
more information)

When ready, bust the door open
and...meet the reinforcements.
Starting the turn you open the
door and lasting for about 5
turns, a knight and a cavalier
will spawn. I personally sat my
mage right next to the statue,
my healer next to him, and a
paladin (aka strong physical
unit) to the north where he
killed the rest.

At the end, get ready to destroy
the boss. He is hapless against
long-ranged attacks, so you can
easily kill him using this
trick.

Anyway...

Check out the secret shop behind

DIALOGUE

Nyna: Marth! Any word? Have you
found your family? Your sister?

Marth: ...My sister was taken by
Gharnef. She is no longer
here... And my...my mother is...
She is dead. Slain...by that
Dolunian dragon...

Nyna: ....! Marth, I am truly
sorry...

Marth: I thought there would be
something...some part of my old
life I would be coming back to.
I fought so hard...

Nyna: You fought wonderfully,

(Enter Malledus)

Malledus: ...Sire, might I have
a moment?

Marth: All the moments you want,
Malledus. What is it?

Malledus: Your people have
gathered outside the castle.
They are overjoyed to be free
again, sire, and would like very
much to see their prince.

Marth: All right, then. I'll go
at once.

Nyna: Marth...perhaps you should
let that wait, just until you
are able to share their joy with
them. We could send someone in
your stead-

Marth: No, that would not do.
Today is a momentous day for my
kingdom and my people. I must
celebrate with them now, not
later. Anything else would be a
disservice to those who died to
save Altea. I am a prince before
I am a son or a brother.

Come, Malledus. Let us go greet
my people.

(Flashes to a scene with him
waving to crowd. Dialogue runs
from a narrator on the top)

"Thus Altea was liberated. Its
people, ragged from years of
Dolunian tyranny, scrambled to
the castle and flocked beneath
its walls, eager to celebrate
what, for many, would be
remembered as the happiest days
of their lives. They clapped
each other on the back, laughed;
and when Marth, their prince,
appeared up above, they saluted
their hero with a thunderous
cheer:

"Glory to Marth, our prince of
light! Glory to our star and
savior!"

Marth smiled down at his people
and waved. The great commander's
last victory of the day was
commanding his tears not to
flow."

Save the game and continue. Note
that if you have less than 15
characters here, you will get
into 17X [CHPE1]

The Sable Order [CHP18]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"For Gotoh to create the magic
that could defeat Gharnef, he
needed two orbs: the Lightsphere
and the Starsphere. Marth and
company set off to Chiasmir and
the Fane of Raman to find them,
but in their path stood a cohort
of Grustian knights known as the
Sable Order. The bridges across
the strait would soon be choked
with the brave and the dead..."


Faster moving units do well on
this map. Also, Marth's rapier
and Shiida's Wing Spear can do
hefty damage. Only drawback is
that there are enemy archers.
Ridersbane is also good.

Use the Master Seal from last
map and then start the game.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Prince Marth, I see
them: a cohort of Grustian
knights, out on the far side of
the bridge. That must be the
Sable Order...

(Nyna enters conversation)

Nyna: Marth, I heard the enemy
forces have been spotted.

Marth: Yes, that's right. The
Sable Order, it seems.

Nyna: Really? Tell me, who leads
them?

Marth: Why does it matter?

Nyna: Oh...no, it's just- they
say the Sable Order is led by a
brilliant general. I
was...wondering if he was riding
with them today.

Marth: You must mean General
Camus. I am told Doluna is not
very happy with him at the
moment, brilliant or not.
Something about acting outside
orders... They'll be keeping him
on a short leash; I don't expect
we'll see him here.

Nyna: That...that is good
news...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Here are the information on the
houses:


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) Rumor has it that the person
   defending the Fane or Raman
   is not a strong
warrior, but instead a weak
person. And it's a she...

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


To begin this map, just move
your units forward. Keep your
units that have the special
weapons (ie. Ridersbane) in the
front. There are 4-5 cavaliers
that immediately rush from the
south, defeat them first.

By the time this happens, the
group in the middle should have
been provoked. Kill them with
units like Marth and Shiida.

At the end of turn 5, a pegasus
knight, Est, will appear to the
way left. Marth is needed to
recruit Est.

________________________________
Notes about Est + The Triangle
Attack

I have never actually used Est
myself. However, many have, and
they claim her to be the best
Pegasus Knight. Since this is
arguable, I do believe the
reader should be aware to this
possibility.

Obviously, Est is a low level.
She needs arena abuse, so if you
don't like to use the arena,
forget Est right now.

([TRIANGEATTACK]) Another
advantage is the triangle
attack. If you use Palla,
Catria, and Est to surround an
enemy, they should land critical
hits 100% of the time. This is
powerful, but might be unit
costly...three pegasus knights
is a big requirement.

END NOTE
________________________________


Anyhow, she still has dialogue
to be spoken...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Est: Ah, you're Prince Marth! I
am Est, of the Medonian
Whitewings- Palla and Catria's
younger sister. I've been
looking for you. Initially I
intended to join up with you
along with my sisters, but then
I heard Grust had made off with
one of Akaneia's three regalia-
the sword Mercurius- so I flew
there to get it back.

This is Mercurius right here.
It's lovely, isn't it? And
powerful! In the right hands, I
think you'll find it a
formidable weapon indeed.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Since we aren't going to use Est
(well at least I am not!), give
her Ridersbane to a cavalier or
maybe Shiida.

On the middle island, there is
an armory, shops, and an arena.
Unless you really need the
weapons/items, don't bother for
now. You can always go back
before seizing the gate to buy
items.

Reinforcements from the
southwest fort should be heading
toward you. Lure them into the
middle section and then fight.
You don't want to risk losing a
unit to the other enemies in the
southeast.

On turn 14, a paladin will spawn
in the fort in the middle. Use
one of your rear units to get
rid of him. The reinforcements
in the lower southwest corner
will stop spawning at the end of
turn 15. The paladin will keep
spawning though, every other
turn until 18.

Charge the lower part of the map
and let the few units come and
attack you. The reason for this
is that one of the units near
the castle has a ridersbane and
can pose a threat to one of your
units.

If you triggered the two
horsemen to attack you, hope
that all your cavaliers that can
be attacked are at full or close
to full HP.

If you didn't, you can choose
the luxury of picking them off
with Beck. Or you could use
Shiida to go around and kill
them.

Whatever it is, just get to the
boss...

DIALOGUE

Nyna: We've made it across the
strait.

Marth: Yes. But the real battle
may yet be ahead of us.

(Enter Malledus)

Marth: Malledus... Can we be
certain the Lightsphere and the
Starsphere are in the Fane of
Raman?

Malledus: Yes, sire; but
unfortunately, they may not be
all we find. The fane is said to
be guarded by a goddess, one
with fearsome powers. Those who
defile her sanctuary are
punished by fire; none are
spared from the blaze.

Nyna: Perhaps we should
reconsider, Marth...

Marth: Perhaps...But if none are
spared from the blaze, where do
the rumors come from? Besides,
we need those two orbs.

Malledus: Well, might I suggest
you take in just a few able
companions, and let the sleeping
dragons lie?

Marth: Sage advice. I've no
desire to tear apart a holy
place, whether the goddess is
home or not...I'll choose a
handful of elite to search for
the orbs with me.

Manakete Princess [CHP19]

"The Sable Order fought
valiantly to keep Marth's army
from reaching Chiasmir, but in
the end Grust's knights buckled:
the world's mightiest only in
song. The League marched on to
the Fane of Raman, a holy
sanctuary built by the divine
dragoons to house their most
priceless treasures. Here
another story was set to
begin..."


Before the battle, I would use
the Master Seal obtained last
battle on a unit that is level
15-20 (the normal recommended
level to promote). Be sure to
also bring a thief along. When
ready, just start the battle.

Also, set aside one spot for
Bantu, he is needed to recruit,
interestingly, the boss of this
chapter.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Gharnef: Tiki... Tiki...
Princess-that-was of the great
divine dragons... Can you hear
my voice?

Tiki: ....Mm-hmm.

Gharnef: Defilers have set foot
inside the fane- despoilers!
Punish them. Let your fire
consume them!

Tiki: Defilers...in the
fane...Punish them...

Gharnef: Remember, Tiki. Your
divine dragon kin perished long
ago, and Bantu has abandoned
you...I alone am protecting you
from Medeus. Remember...

Tiki: You alone...are protecting
me...Punish...the defilers...

(Gharnef teleports off)

--------------------------------


You might have noticed right off
the bat that this map consists
of a whole bunched of locked
rooms...and seemingly few
enemies around them. That is
partially because most units are
at the top AND that some enemies
are inside the rooms.

There are 10 doors. I will tell
what is in each of them...but
first I need to assign a number
to each door!

 9  10
1     2
3     4
5     6
7     8

With 1 being the room in the
upper-left corner and 8 being in
the lower-right corner. 9 and 10
are the rooms to the extreme
north.

Here are what they contain:

1) Two treasure chest containing
   a Master Seal and a Speedwing
2) Enemy sniper, quite dangerous
   if you don't have sufficient
   back-up the
moment you open the door. Ranged
units killing this sniper
through the upper wall sounds
like a good idea.
3) Enemy archer
4) Two treasure chests
   containing a Geosphere and a
   Seraph Robe.
5) Two treasure chests
   containing a Bolganone and a
   Bullion (XL)
6) Enemy Archer
7) Enemy Archer
8) Two treasures chests
   containing a Spirit Dust and
   a Pure Water
9/10) Connected rooms. Contain
the orbs. One is taken from the
start, so only one chest
remains.

Notice that the rooms alternate
from left to right, anytime you
are stuck this is a sure way to
know which room has treasure and
what room has enemies.

Along with the Master Seal you
get in one chest, you get
another from the enemy sniper
behind Door 2. By now, you
should be sticking with a team
of 15 or so strong units. As
normal, no need to rush using
the Master Seals. Wait until
next battle's preparation.

Anyhow, lure/kill the mages and
healers.

THEN, talk to the boss with
Bantu. The conversation is as
follows:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Bantu: Tiki! Tiki, my child! At
last, I have found you!

Tiki: No... Stop... Come no
closer...

Bantu: Hm? ...Gharnef has put
you in some sort of trance, poor
thing. Peace, child. Peace.
Awaken.

Tiki: ...Mmm? ....Ban-Ban? Is
that you? Where am I? What
happened?

Bantu: Yes, child. 'tis I, 'tis
I. How I worried! Are you hurt?

Tiki: No, Ban-ban, just...just
scared...I feel as though I just
woke from an awful nightmare...

Bantu: I am truly sorry, child.
Truly, I am. I will not let us
be separated again. From now on,
I will be there to protect you.

Tiki: Promise? You have to
promise, Ban-ban. I hate being
alone...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Seize the gate.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Nyna: Marth! Tell me, was it a
success? Did you locate the
Lightsphere and Starsphere?

Marth: Never fear; I have them.
We need to take these to Gotoh
so he can undo Imhullu's
magic...But first, Nyna, we've a
more pressing task ahead of us.

Nyna: Oh? And what is that?

Marth: We must Grust once and
for all. If we march south
without finishing them off, we
have our rear exposed.

Nyna: Then you mean to invade.

Marth: Yes. And this time,
General Camus will be there to
meet us. I am sure of it. "Camus
the Sable", they call him. Many
extol him as the most able
warrior alive. It will be a
fierce battle...but one we
cannot avoid.

Nyna: You are certain we must
face him? We have crippled
Grust, but they will regroup and
stand in our way again. No, we
need to stamp this fire out
before the wind catches it and
starts spreading it anew.

Nyna: Very well. But before you
attack, there is something I
must tell you. Later,
though...Not yet. I must sort my
feelings out first...

"It was General Ordwin, one of
the Three Heroes of the War of
Liberation, who put Grust on the
map. His peerless knights tamed
their neighbors the barbarians
in the kingdom's infancy,
securing its place as one of the
greatest of the Seven Kingdoms.
However, the current king,
Ludwik, was weak-willed and
easily cowed: Doluna had little
trouble forcing him into an
alliance. Now he had taken ill,
even as Grust suffered its
string of defeats at the hand of
the League. The once mighty
kingdom was poised to fall..."


I highly recommend Beck, to
counter the enemy ballistas.
Other than that, just take your
other generic team (I used Beck
anyway, so that worked out).

Other than that, you may wish to
use your master seal to promote
units. Also, use the various
stat boosts from last battle's
chests. My team at this point in
the game looked like:


Abel - Paladin (Level 3) - A
good tank, reliable to destroy
enemies

Frey - Paladin (Level 6) - Has
better stats than Frey, but I
keep Abel with the stronger
weapons. Both of them can
overpower about three units
before me having to worry about
them dying.

Gordin - Sniper (Level 7) - A
real tank. Last time a few units
attacked him and he only took
about 10 (out of 45) damage.
Funny thing is that his defence
is only 5 away from the arguably
"broken" Level 20 promoted Wolf.
His only problem is his movement
and his attack, but that isn't
the purpose of a tank right?

Shiida - Dracoknight (Level 1) -
Just leveled with Master Seal
before fight. Good to reach
units that are relatively far
away. Destroys generals,
knights, cavaliers, paladins,
etc.

Marth - Lord (Level 17) - A
little low compared to what most
readers might have, but he
suffices for me since he has 14
attack.

Lena - Bishop (Level 7) - My
healer. She also can deal anime
magic damage.

Ogma - Hero (Level 1) - Also
just leveled with Master Seal
before fight.

Beck - Ballistican (Level 16) -
Strong since I put him to use.

Nabarl - Swordmaster (Level 7) -
Ouch. With 26 speed, 24 skill,
16 strength, and 21 luck, he
beats all the enemies as easy as
Wolf does.

Wolf - Horseman (Level 20) - A
real description isn't
necessary. He is my back-up just
in case an enemy puts one of my
units in danger.

Merric - Sage (Level 1) - A weak
link in my army, but he is
strong when on the offensive.
His defence is still only seven
though, so I rarely risk him on
the frontlines.


Note that I NEVER changed
classes, I kept them the way
they are. That is because there
is no real need to. Now,
provided that the units above
are a tad bit stronger than they
SHOULD be. This is because I
arena abused a few of them.
However, I am at a point in the
game where I literally rip the
enemies to shreds due to me
having used this "all-star" team
the whole game.

What I mean by the above is that
you don't need to be as strong
as I was. Now, if you abused
more than I have (as some
readers might), then you may
disregard this... :P

Anyway, when ready, start the
map.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Nyna, we'll soon be
launched the attack. If you have
something to tell me...now is
the time to do it.

Nyna: All right, Marth. As you
wish. When the Doluna-Grust
allied forces seized control of
Akaneia, the entire royal family
was killed, save me. I was given
into Grust's custody- the
custody of the Sable Order, to
be more specific I am told
Doluna wished for my execution-
and with it the end of the holy
lineage of House Akaneia- and
Grust was willing to comply.

Marth: But you are not dead.

Nyna: That is right. I was not
put to the sword. The Sable
Order's captain came to my
defence. His name...was Camus.

Marth: ....!

Nyna: Camus protected me,
knowing he risked incurring the
wrath of the Shadow Dragon. He
was the one who eventually
arranged for my escape to
Aurelis.

Marth: ...I had no idea. That
certainly explains Doluna's
displeasure with him.

Nyna: I hated him, too, at
first. But in the time, I found
my hatred tempered by the
compassion he showed me, my
feelings...changed. And no, all
I wish is to see him again...But
not if it means you and he must
fight.

Marth: Nyna... Do you... I
cannot make any promises. But I
will do what I can. I hope you
can accept that.

Nyna: Thank you, Marth. I could
not ask for more.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


First turn, use Beck to get rid
of the ballista. If you don't
have him, move Shiida and any
other flier away until you kill
it. This is because the ballista
has arrowspatte and most likely
will critically damage your
flier.

Use Shiida's Wing Spear to
defeat the generals in the
vicinity.

Now, I RECOMMEND using an
overpowered unit like Wolf to
solo the west side. Equip him an
Iron Sword and all four paladins
will attack...and promptly all
die. There are two ballistas
randomly placed out there,
killing them will solve a whole
bunch of immediate problems.

Another immediate problem is the
paladins to the north. They deal
about 15 damage to some of my
units and thus put some at risk
of dying since there are four of
them. When done, move Marth up
north. Use the danger zone to
position them out of range of
the ballistas. Then, DO NOT move
Marth or anyone that is with
him.

By the time you find a way to
defeat them, Wolf should have
destroyed the ballistas. Now,
randomly assorted reinforcements
will appear along with a thief
trying to destroy the village in
the center.

I swung in my paladins for
support. The reinforcements are
relatively small.

Now, use Beck to destroy the
ballista next to the castle.
Hopefully you have one
thunderbolt left (I had exactly
one left).

Automatically, Marth will decide
to talk to Camus (note that this
is implied and all we see is the
dialogue below)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: General Camus! Can you
hear me? It is I, Marth of
Altea! I must speak with you!
Please, show yourself!

Camus: Prince Marth. I am Camus
of Grust.

Marth: General, I have no wish
to fight you. You know this
battle is pointless; surely you
must!

Camus: So long as Grust
continues to support Doluna's
ambitions, it does not matter
what I know or think. I am a
knight; I have a duty to fight
for my motherland's glory till
the very end.

Marth: But surely-

Camus: Prince Marth, there is
nothing you can do or say. I am
party to your father's murder.
Are you a man or not? Draw your
sword.

(Enter Nyna)

Nyna: Stop! Camus!

Camus: Princess Nyna...

Marth: Nyna, what are you doing
here?! This is the middle of the
battlefield!

Nyna: I know, I know... But
please, Camus, listen to
me...Camus, you gave me back my
life. And Marth, he gave me back
my kingdom. I do not wish to see
that the two of you fight. It
is...it is unbearable. Please,
Camus, fight with us. We need
your strength.

...I need it [oh snap!]

Camus: I am sorry, Princess.

Nyna: What? But, Camus!

Camus: Were my heart my master,
I would do exactly as you say.
But what sort of knight abandons
his kingdom- his king!- now,
when they need him the most?
Would you have me toss away the
life I have built as if it meant
nothing at all?

Nyna: No, Camus, I.... I don't
know...

Camus: I have lived as a knight,
and I intend to die as one.
There are no other roads left
for me to walk. Farewell, my
princess. I shall never forget
our days together at the palace,
few though they were. I pray you
meet someone who can bring joy
back into your life.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Oh well, that conversation
almost looked like we could
recruit Camus. It isn't possible
to recruit Camus, attacking him
yields the following
conversation.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Camus: With this lance,
Gradivus, I am all but
invincible. A pity you had to
waste your life.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


--------------------------------
NOTES ABOUT CAMUS (inspired by
Amano_kun's contribution - quite
a bit here is from him)


It is not mandatory to kill
Camus. You may ignore him and
decide to just seize the gate.
However, there are three things
to keep in mind:

1) You will get an alternate
   scene. Camus DOES NOT join
   you. Nyna will change
her dialogue to say that Camus
was not able to be found.
2) You run the risk of losing a
   unit if you aren't careful
   enough.
3) You won't get his drop,
   Gravidus, which is a powerful
   weapon

To finish the map without
killing him, you must swing
Marth over to the left along
with Shiida. Put Marth in range
of seizing the gate, then on the
next turn, swing Shiida to
recruit Lorenz. Move Lorenz
aside and seize the gate.

END NOTE
(Thanks to Amano_kun again)
--------------------------------


Camus uses the legendary lance
and packs a punch. Eliminate him
with a Ridersbane + Beck combo.
When you kill him, he says:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Camus: Nyna...Farewell...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


You might not be able to get
Camus, but you can recruit
Lorenz, the general guarding the
gate. You need either Marth or
Shiida. The following is the
conversation:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Shiida: General Lorenz! My name
is Shiida. I hail from Talys. My
father has told me quite a bit
about you.

Lorenz: Princess Shiida! My,
look what a lovely young women
you've grown into. Your father
was a good friend to me, many
years ago.

Shiida: General, I heard you
opposed Grust forming an
alliance with Doluna. Why didn't
you try to stop it?

Lorenz: You think I did not try,
Princess? Our king is meek; in
the end, Doluna proved better at
cowing him than I did.

Shiida: But sir, surely you know
that Doluna intends to use
Manaketes to conquer humankind!
You must act now- for Grust's
sake, if not the world's! Join
us, General Lorenz. We can put
an end to this battle right now.

Lorenz: Hmm...What you say makes
sense enough, but I serve Grust.
I cannot simply betray my
country.

Shiida: Ah, but what makes a
country?

Lorenz: Pardon?

Shiida: Is it one man- your
king? Or is it the countless
innocent people who make their
home here?

Lorenz: Well, that's- Hmm...

Shiida: My father has a saying:
"A kingless country is a country
still; but a king without
subjects rules naught but
hills." If you disobey your king
to ensure his subjects' safety,
how is that a betrayal? You are
protecting his reign.

Lorenz: Protecting his reign?
...Aha ha ha, ha ha! Ahh, that
mad logic! I feel as though I've
shed twenty years and I'm
talking to your father again.
You win, Princess. I yield! I
will join you, in the intersts
of king and country. Har!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


If you talked to Lorenz with
Marth, the conversation is as
follows:

(THANKS TO SUPERARC!)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: General Lorenz, hold!

Lorenz: What? You are Marth, the
Altean prince...

Marth: Yes, sir. The king of
Talys told me much about you. He
said you opposed Grust forming
an alliance with Doluna, right
from the very start.

Lorenz: That's right.

Marth: Then fight with us! With
your help, we can defeat Doluna!

Lorenz: Forgive me, Prince
Marth, but am I to just abandon
my country, then?

Marth: ...

Lorenz: I know yours is the just
cause. Still, I wish to remain a
Grustian general, right to the
end. I am fighting here because
that is the way for me to honor
my kingdom.

Marth: Forgive me, General,
but...is it, really?

Lorenz: Pardon?

Marth: Since you are a Grustian
General, then surely you fight
for Grust's future first and
foremost. But tell me...from
where you are standing now, do
you see any future for your
country?

Lorenz: ...I shall have to learn
to mask my misgivings better, if
you can pluck them from my heart
so easily. You are quite
correct. If I care what becomes
of Grust, then I cannot continue
to stand by Doluna. So, I will
stand by you instead, Prince-
and hope the future is a bit
easier to spot from there.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


(CREDIT TO SUPERARC!)

Note that Lorenz is a promoted
general and thus, I naturally
dislike him. Also note that I
didn't realize Camus could deal
36 total damage to a unit with
17 defence, and since I probably
won't use him anyway, I decided
to not restart the chapter.

Note that I did not kill him
first because I still believed
there was a way to recruit him.
To avoid what happened to me, it
is imperative to kill Camus
first

BEFORE SEIZING THE GATE, check
out the village to the south you
might have missed with Marth.
Get the Hammerene, a good staff
for Lena only.

Finally, seize the gate.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Forgive me, Nyna. I was
unable to reunite you with your
general.

Nyna: No, Marth, I...I should
not have made such a selfish
request. I am sorry, so terribly
sorry...

Marth: ....

Nyna: The worst part,
Marth...the worst part is, I
knew it would come to this. Ever
since I gave you the emblem, I
just knew...Have you heard the
story of Artemis's Curse?

Marth: No...

Nyna: The last time the Fire
Emblem changed hands to save
House Akaneia, it was not
without cost. There was a
princess named Artemis who loved
your ancestor, Anri, with all
her heart. He loved her as well-
but when Medeus appeared, the
two were parted forever. She
cursed the Fire Emblem- called
it the end of war, but also the
end of love.

Now the emblem has changed hands
again, and I am the one who is
cursed...

Marth: Nyna...

(if you didn't kill Camus, Nyna
will say something about how he
was not able to be found)

Nyna: Look at me, so quick to
fall apart... You lost loved
ones in Altea and took it so
bravely; but I cannot be so
brave... Please...leave me for a
moment. This is too much to
bear. I need to...to confront my
feelings...

Marth: ...Say no more, Nyna...
Princess. I will step out. Send
for me if you need anything.

Nyna: Thank you, Marth...

(Marth leaves and the bottom
screen of our DS goes black for
some odd reason)

Nyna: Ahh...! Camus, Camus...
Ahh...no... Oh, why...

Clash in Medon [CHP21]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


"Grust would harry the League no
more. Marth led his forces on to
Medon. However, Medon's Dragoons
were ready to waylay them at the
border; countless reinforcements
hovered within the fortresses,
waiting to strike...Would Marth
be able to lead the League
safely through the gauntlet?"


There isn't much to do on this
map, just that picking fewer
units will make it easier to
defend them. Start the map when
ready.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Sire, we are nearing
the Medonian border.

Marth: Did you send a messenger?

Malledus: Yes...but...

Marth: They will not yield.

Malledus: No reply came, sire...

Marth: I knew they might not
switch and join us, but I had at
least hoped to avoid
bloodshed...So be it. Medon
stands between us and Doluna.
And Gotoh is here somewhere as
well. If the battle must be
fought, I mean to fight it well.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


IF YOU HAVE MINERVA IN YOUR
PARTY, you will receive the
following dialogue:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Princess Minerva, we will
soon reach the Macedonian
border. Are you certain you wish
to join the battle? If you've
any reservations about fighting
your own countrymen-

Minerva: If I did, Prince Marth,
I would not have offered you my
axe.

Marth: But surely-

Minerva: You have the wrong
idea. Perhaps you think I wish
to spare my brother and former
vassals, forgive them for seeing
things differently?

Marth: ...Don't you?

Minerva: I would be lying if I
said I did not wish it were that
simple. But history needs to
remember that when Macedon went
astray, it was a Macedonian who
set things right.Marth: Even if
it means your own brother may
die?

Minerva: Since I was little, I
followed in Michalis's
footsteps. Whatever books he
read, I read; whenever he
practiced the sword, I was close
by, watching, learning...He was
always a step ahead: my hero,
something to aspire to. Even
now, some part of me loves him.
...I love him enough to spare
him death on some stranger's
sword, you see? Let him be
punished by my hands.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Basically if you don't have any
weak units and all your units
can fight for themselves, you
are good to go on this map. The
reinforcements appear in sheer
numbers, it's almost impossible
to kill them all in one turn.

This makes it hard to defend a
weak healer or a mage. Which is
why I recommend taking less
units into this battle.

You can defeat the Generals at
the beginning without provoking
the mages near the castle. At
about turn 6, about 6 enemy
dracoknights/pegasus knights
will appear. It takes about two
turns to catch and defeat all of
them. Of course, have a healer
run around with Mend ready to
heal.

There isn't more to write in
here, just that the
reinforcements will spawn in
about every three turns. Coming
in only three times total the
whole battle, all you must do is
press the X button to check
their range and act accordingly.

If you have a REALLY hard time,
move all your units to the right
side behind and in the forest.
Or just advance to an enemy
corner and kill the units as the
turn they spawn.

Beck works well to eliminate
reinforcements.

Of course, after the
reinforcements end for the third
time, just go attack the
generals and finish the map like
normal.

After this, kill the healers and
then move onto the boss.

Gotoh: ...Prince Marth...

Marth: That voice! Lord Gotoh,
is that you?

Gotoh: I see you have made it to

aerie, their castle. If you
possess the Lightsphere and
Starsphere have them in hand
when you visit me here.

...Ah, yes. I also have good
news. Your sister Elice is
unharmed.

Marth: What?! You are certain?
Where is she now?

Gotoh: Thabes, city of illusion.
Gharnef took her with him when
he fled. I pray you rescue her
soon.

Marth: I will!

Gotoh: But first, bring me the
two orbs. Without Starlight's
mighty blast, Gharnef will only
add you life to the list of
things he has taken from you.

A Knight-Filled Sky [CHP22]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"The Medon that Minerva and
Maria remembered best was one of
peace: a quiet, prosperous
kingdom famed for the flying
beasts favored by dracoknights.
But then their brother, Prince
Michalis, succumbed to his lust
for power. Despite his sisters'
adamant opposition, he sword
allegiance to Doluna; and when
Medon's Dragoons took flight,
the world suffered. Even now
that the tides had turned,
Michalis took position for one
last stand. Dracoknights filled
the sky end to end, eager to
pluck Marth from the Earth."



This battle is about speed and
endurance, as you will need to
fight multiple enemies while
rushing to Gotoh's village.
Whoever has the two orbs, trade
them to Marth now.

Start the battle when ready.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Michalis: Lord Gotoh, the League
has begun its attack. I wish for
you to move someplace safe until
the fighting has ended.

Gotoh: Why not just end this
folly now, Michalis?

Michalis: Folly? What folly?

Gotoh: You loved your younger
sister so much. It pains me to
see you quarrel. If you and
Minerva had worked as one, Medon
might have become a great
kingdom- greater even than
Akaneia, perhaps.

But instead, you let Gharnef
trick you into destroying your
family, and your kingdom with
it.

Michalis: ...I cannot undo what
is done. My father's blood will
always be on my hands, just as
Minerva's betrayal of her
brother and country will be on
hers. And Medon has not been
destroyed, not yet. So long as I
carry Iote's Shield, the
League's arrows cannot fell me.

Gotoh: Very well. And if you
win? What then?

Michalis: If I win, I will tell
you. Right now, my only goal is
to gut that Altean prince who
leads the League. My pride as
Medonian king rests upon it.

Gotoh: I see... Then we've
nothing more to discuss, have
we?

(Michalis leaves)

Gotoh: The weight of his
father's murder threatens to
crush him...Poor boy. ...Poor
fool.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


On turn 1, use Beck to kill the
thief. Move the other units
forward through the right side.

Keep rushing, use Beck to kill
some of the dragoons up there.
By the time you reach the
village, all but a few units
should be killed. Beck can keep
killing the remaining few units
(arrowspatte works great against
the fliers)

Then, go to the village with
Marth WHO HAS BOTH ORBS IN HIS
INVENTORY.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Gotoh: You have the Lightsphere
and Starsphere with you? Well
done! Now I can create Starlight
for you.

...There. It is finished. Take
this with you; it is the only
magic capable of breaking
through Imhullu. Use it to stop
that fiend Gharnef once and for
all.

(OBTAINED STARLIGHT)

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Move your units up the steps in
front of the forts. For a few
turns, two reinforcements will
spawn in. They make for good
experience for any lower level
units you might have.

However, make sure that you
bring up your entire army as a
whole wave of enemies will
appear. I recommend attacking
with your units, then using a
healer, like Lena, to use
Fortify. It heals all your units
for a vast amount of HP.

Note: You can plug the forts as
normal.

The reinforcements end at about
turn 15. Note that the boss
should be the only enemy left.
He carries an Iote Shield, which
negates an archer's advantage
over fliers. You still can
damage him with arrows, it just
won't be super effective.

The boss himself doesn't pose a
major threat.

Personally, me Beck did a
critical hit with a Pachyderm,
but it wouldn't matter anyway
since the boss could be killed
fast with a combo of Nabarl +
Abel.

Marth: First General Camus of
Grust....Now Prince Michalis of
Medon. Men of such promise...Had
the times been different, the
two might have led illustrious
lives.

Malledus: Yes, Prince Michalis
was a brilliant man with great
things ahead of him. But in the
end, the rashness of youth did
him in.

Marth: Only because Gharnef
found his weakness and exploited
it. Until we stop that fiend,
this spiral of misery will never
cease.

Malledus: Then shall we go to
Thabes? Lord Gotoh said the city
lies someplace far to the north
of Khadein.

Marth: Yes, in the heart of the
desert...

Malledus: Thabes is an old
city... None in recent memory
have gone there and returned
alive. Within its walls remain
many powerful apparatus crafted
of long-forgotten magic. Lord
Gotoh believes Gharnef is
harnessing their power, and that
is why he wields such influence
over the continent.

Marth: And he has Imhullu as
well...This will be a struggle.

Marth: Still, Gharnef's reign
must end. The world was so much
more beautiful before he painted
it red...

its walls Gharnef was waiting,
and now, Marth must wrest
Falchion and his sister, Elice,

If you mean to harm me, first
you'll have to find me, boy.

sorcerers have been sighted
throughout the temple!
They're...They all seem to be

Marth: Where?

Malledus: The Tower of Thabes
atop this very temple.

Marth: Then we don't need to
fight Gharnef...If we find those
apparatus.

Malledus: Gharnef's power- a
great deal of power- will be
sealed forever.

Marth: Then let's hurry and
seize the entrance to the tower!

Malledus: A word of caution,
sir. Stopping the apparatus will
not undo Imhullu power- only
Gharnef's. He still has Falchion
in his keeping; if you want the
blade back, you must defeat him
now, before seizing the tower.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


You probably got attacked by an
archer and a mage (with Swarm)
last round. Just eliminate the
archer and heal whoever got
attacked.

--------------------------------
NOTES ABOUT GHARNEF:

I have recently found on my
second playthrough that Gharnef
is randomly placed between the
three Gharnefs. He may the first
one your face, or he might be
all the way in the back.

You know that you have killed
him if you see the dialogue
after and you get the "Obtained
Falchion!" message instead of
"Obtained Steel Sword!"

Note that you can easily beat
this map if he dead fast because
no reinforcement pop up.

Also, it doesn't matter if you
kill him, the fakes are still
there.

A nice way to find the fake
Gharnef, credit to BardicheX, is
to use Beck. If you attack the
real one, dialogue will appear.
If not, nothing happens other
than the attack.
--------------------------------


The goal on this map is to kill
the three Gharnef first, then to
take care of the boss. The first
guy to kill is the Gharnef to
the bottom. It might take a few
turns because of the healers
using physic and fortify, but
Starlight will kill him.


--------------------------------
***SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING AB

It has been reported (by
SuperArc and later by BardicheX)
that you can damage the fake
Gharnef(s) with counterattacks
and regular attacks. THIS IS NOT
A MISPRINT!

The battle preparation screen
will register 0 when you go to
attack a fake, but in actuality,
you will do regular damage. This
information is pretty cool.

ALSO NOTE!

A great strategy to find the
real Gharnef's location is to
use the GEOSPHERE. It damages
all units (including your units)
on the battlefield. The real
Gharnef will not take damage,
but all the fakes will. This
makes it easy to seperate the
real from the fake.

Simply use a Fortify to recover
your units' health.

(Thanks deathaxe444)
--------------------------------


The fake Gharnefs will drop a
Steel Sword instead of the
Falchion.


On turn 7, IF Gharnef is still
alive, he will summon in some
more enemies.

Now, the best way to approach
the nest above is to use Beck to
eliminate the mages and healers
first. Some of them will charge
you, and use Swarm to do damage.
Others are just normal mages,
but nevertheless, don't risk
sending units forward to attack
since there is at least one mage
at the top who can pick you off
with Swarm. Once they reach the
staircase, it is OKAY to send
other units to clear the mages.

By the time you clear the first
wave of mages, Gharnef will
cower out again (if he is dead
already, then you will not see
the reinforcements)

and decide to send yet another
wave of reinforcements in. Do
the same to them as you did the
first wave.

After the second wave, Gharnef
stops sending more mage
reinforcements.

Now is the time to move your
units in. Lure in the Swarm mage
to attack Beck, then destroy
him. Move the rest of your units
in and kill the healers and
other enemies.

Before you attack the second
Gharnef, make sure to destroy
all other distractions. Then,
send in whoever has Starlight to
kill the Gharnef.

Note that a good combo to kill
the units on the top is
Stonehoist then a Pachyderm to
finish the enemy off. Strength
needed to pull this off is 15.

The real Gharnef when attacked
(for me it was the guy to the
right of the throne) will say


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Gharnef: Heh heh heh...You dare
challenge me, fool? You must not
value your life. Cower before
the might of the dark magic
Imhullu!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Gharnef should be no problem if
you have a decent mage using
Starlight. The healer to the
left is annoying, and he will
prolong the life of Gharnef. But
no matter, Gharnef will fall
after a few turns (use your own
mage to support your mage)

When he dies, the dialogue is as
follows:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Gharnef: Agh! What... Where did
you get...Starlight...? Still,
you are a fool ...Your power is
not enough to defeat Medeus...I
shall be waiting in the pits of
the inferno...for when he sends
you to join me... Heh heh, ha ha
ha!

(OBTAIN FALCHION)

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


There is still one Gharnef left.
However, feel free to put in a
chapter save since the most part
of this chapter is over.

Send in your mage again to
defeat Gharnef, but first use
Beck to kill the healer there.

The boss isn't anything special.
Kill him with a weaker unit for
great exp. He also drops a
Master Seal.

Before seizing the gate, be sure
to grab the chests way back
where you spawned.


--------------------------------
1) Bullion (S)
2) Tailsman
--------------------------------


ALSO, check out the secret shop
behind the throne. See [4D] for
more details.

Seize the gate.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: At last...Gharnef is
finished.

(Ally soldier enters)

Allied Soldier: Sire! We found
Princess Elice up in the Tower
of Thabes! She's on her way to
see you right- Ah, here she is!

(Elice runs in)

Marth: Elice!!!

Elice: Marth! Oh look at you. A
man grown! [oh the cliche...]

Marth: Sister, I was so worried.
None had seen you since the
castle fell. I...I feared the
worst.

Elice: I was prepared for the
worst, if that was what it took
to ensure your safety. But they
did not kill me. Gharnef spared
my life.

Marth: Why would he spare you?

Elice: Marth, have you heard of
the staff of Aum?

Marth: The staff that brings
back the dead? It was lost to
the world long ago, or so the
legend goes.

Elice: Yes, but Gharnef found
it...in the Resurrectory.

Marth: The Resurrectory? What
was it doing in a temple in the
middle of Doluna?

Elice: I could not say. But that
was why Gharnef kept me alive:
he wished me to wield it. The
staff of Aum's power can only be
channeled by woman of royal
blood. Marth, you are going to
Doluna, are you not?

Marth: Yes. I must settle things
with Medeus.

Elice: Then take me to the
Resurrectory along the way to
claim the staff. Aum works but
once, but I will use it to
revive a lost comrade.

END DIALOGUE

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
The Dragonkin Realm [CHP24]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"Doluna...Land of the Manaketes.
Before Medeus, the dragonkin had
few dealings with the human
realm, but when the Shadow
Dragon came, everything changed.
He sunk all Akaneia into a cycle
of war, in which heroes rose and
heroes fell- always claiming his
cause was just and the human
deaths deserved. But now
Medeus's empire was
crumbling...He was nearing the
end of his reign...even as Marth
was nearing then end of his long
quest."


For this map, take Bantu along
to recruit. Other than that, do
the normal. Start map and
Malledus will come to talk to
Marth before.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: There, sire. Up on the
mountains to the south, you can
see Doluna Keep.

(Camera zooms briefly)

Marth: And inside is Medeus,
king of the earth dragons- the
one they call the Shadow Dragon.

...Why doesn't he leave the keep
and face us?

Malledus: I recall Lord Gotoh
saying his return is not yet
complete; only within the keep's
walls can he maintain dragon
form.

Marth: Really...? Then we have
the advantage...

(Malledus leaves conversation)

Marth: To Doluna Keep, then! Let
us put a stop to this war!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


First turn, kill the thief with
Beck. Then, move the rest of
your units forward

To our amazement, there is a
lone house. It's been a while...


--------------------------------
HOUSES

1) The fortress to the southeast
   is where you can get the Aum
   staff.

END HOUSES
--------------------------------


There are two types of Manaketes
here, the ones with Firestones
and the ones with Magestones.
The latter is by far more
powerful and I only advise using
the strongest of units to kill
them.

Your units should be able to
conquer the east side with ease,
the hard part is holding it. I
would send a unit like Wolf
through the gap in the mountains
to the left.

This map is hard because there
are 53 turns of reinforcements!
(Thanks to Gabeftw for waiting
53 turns O_o)

Quickly, and I mean as soon as
possible, put a unit on the
forts to the south and east.
These are really annoying and
unless you need experience, stay
away.

After blocking the forts,
reinforcements are...

1 Hero (Armed with Silver Axe) 1
Bishop (Armed with Bolganone) 1
Manakete (Armed with a
Firestone)

These units are enough to cause
trouble, leave guards near the
fort to deal with the spawning.

A flier is recommended to
capture the base that the
Manakete spawns in.

The goal to stop these
reinforcements is to simply not
let them spawn in, put a unit on
the fort to quell resistance.
Thankfully, the boss cannot
attack further than 1 range, so
you are free to place two units
on the forts there.

After all this fighting (you
have to kill the rest of the
stationary units before the
above is even considered), you
should only have the fortress
and the boss left.

For the fortress, just flood
with strong units. The chest in
there contains the Aum staff,
which allows you to resurrect a
lost unit.


________________________________
A little bit about the Aum Staff

This, along with the Hammerene
Staff, is one of the most
strategic staves in the entire
game. It opens up a whole new
realm of possibilities.

First of all, if you are going
for Chapter 24x, you can
resurrect Tiki there.

A few rules/notes:

1) The Aum staff has ONE charge.
   Use wisely.

2) When you resurrect a unit,
   they come back with their
   same levels (note that
weapons were put in the convoy
already when they died)

3) The Aum Staff can only be
   used by specific units. The
   user must be of royal
descent. The game hints to use
Elice, which is fine. Other
choices include Maria and
Minerva.

For the boss...

BOSS: Xemcel
HP: 34

Weapon: Magestone
Drop: N/A

Beginning Quote: "This land, all
of it- it belonged to us! Then
you humans took it...defiled
it!"

DIALOGUE

Enemy Soldier: Emperor! The
enemy has broken through the
gates!

Medeus: That impudent boy...Have
the guards take their positions.
The keep must be defended.

Enemy Soldier: At once!

(Enemy Soldier leaves)

Medeus: Hmph, you'll find an
earth dragon like me harder to
tame than Gharnef, brat. Come
and face me. I'll tear the
ground asunder and make you wish
you'd never been born!

END DIALOGUE

Chosen by Fate [ENDGAME]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


"The long war had been fought,
Akaneia's many lands freed, and
now the League had cornered
their archenemy within his
castle. They broke into four
groups and stormed the four
gates of Doluna Keep- unaware
that this was exactly what
Medeus was expecting. Bravely,
these warriors fate had chosen
steeled themselves for one last
struggle."


This battle has a lot of
preparation going on. First of
all, if you usually pick only 12
or less units, you have the
advantage here. The game
recommends splitting into four
parties, but if you want, you
can choose to only deploy troops
in three of the four regions.
This gives you the advantage of
not being spread out too much.

The three regions I would pick
to have units in are every
region except the one in the
northwest.

For this battle, don't bring any
unit that will drag you down.
Only the best are needed. Bring
the strongest weapons: Falchion,
Gravidus, Mericdus, etc.

Also, give a Door Key to Marth.

Then, when ready, begin the
final chapter of the game.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: We made it. Now we just
have to find Medeus...

(Enter Malledus)

Malledus: Sire! Lord Gotoh is
here to see you.

(Enter Gotoh)

Gotoh: Marth, you have fought
splendidly.

Marth: Lord Gotoh?! What are you
doing here?

Gotoh: I washed my hands of
humankind and their foolish ways
long ago. But you and your
companions have convinced me
that was a rash decision.
Perhaps there is hope for you
yet. Allow me to offer what help
I can.

Marth: You mean you'll fight
with us?

Gotoh: Yes. I may lack the power
to stop Medeus, but his minions
are another story. Let this old
man strike them down and clear a
path for you.

...The gods have chosen you,
Marth, prince of light. Go now,
and win back a future for us
all. Your family would be proud.

Marth: ....!

(Flashback to
alllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
the way back in Prologue)

Cain: His last words were as
follows: "Tell my son that I
leave the future of Altea and
our continent in his hands."

(Flashback to another scene is
Prologue)

Malledus: Your sister knows that
you are the future of Altea-
nay, the whole land!

(Back to reality!)

Marth: Come, my friends! We have
a dragon to tame! Help me
confine Medeus to the shadows
for all eternity, and bring
light back into the world!

(Weird scene shows were Medeus
is in dragon form)

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


________________________________
1-2 Way to Beat this Chapter

There are some interesting ways
of beating this chapter in 1-2
turns. It has Warp involved of
course, it would be impossible
otherwise.

(Credit to Dragondudea6)

First, have two warp staves.
Give one to a capable unit and
leave another in the convoy. On
the first turn, assuming you got
Gotoh, let him fish in the
convoy for a Warp staff.

On the second turn, warp one
units to kill the Manakete in
from of Medeus. Use the other
warper to warp a strong unit
(lvl 30 Marth works) and kill
the boss in that same turn.

Congrats! You just beat the last
chapter in 1-2 turns!
________________________________



This is it. The final battle.

Gotoh is in the area next to
Marth.

First turn, use the door key to
open the door. Converge your
units toward the enemies
situated in the middle area.
There are a lot of them, and it
will most likely take special
weapons (Wyrmslayer) to prevail
without risking a unit.

We are aiming for most enemy
units, except one (in the
extreme lower-left), to be wiped
out from the left side.

This map is interesting in that
the doors will close in
unnecessary places after all
your units move past it. Note
that enemy reinforcements will
still spawn here, so you will
need ranged units to take care
of them.

I recommend sending Wolf or any
extremely strong unit to the
north. Use Parthia on the
Manaketes and any weapon on the
heroes.

Send a whole bunch of units up,
and do the same as last map. The
reinforcements are long. I mean
long. According to A2Moogle,
they can last as long as 60
turn!

(There is some controversy and
unclearness since, according to
Terrin14, they only last for 50
turns)

However long the turns are, it
still means that you will need
to cover the staircases near the
boss's right (a Dracoknight with
Javelin spawns there) and to the
left (ballistas).

To the left, the ballista will
occasionally spawn and will
harass your units who are trying
to kill Medeus. Make sure to
send an archer to defeat them.

Four units spawn in the bottom
also, they are annoying,
especially the Manakete (they
are armed with Magestones that
deal nasty damage).

Another reinforcement is to the
west, in the room. It's a bishop
with Swarm and you probably
should take it out (though
ballistas take priority)

Fortify is your best friend
here. When this is all over, all
that is left is Medeus. Bring in
your best units and get them
fully healed.

You can have three units at max
crowding around him attacking:
two ranged and one physical.
Watch your units HP and keep in
mind that the throne will heal
him.

I recommend sending in your
units that have the regalia:
Parthia, Mercurius, and
Gradivus. They plus Marth's
final attack (of Falchion)
should be enough to kill him.
Keep in mind that the best way
to attack is to let him attack
you first, so as to avoid his
counter-strike.

Also note that Medeus has a
HORRIBLE attack rate, he
attacked twice and missed both
times. Of course, I got lucky
with a critical, cutting his HP
in half.

He isn't hard compared to other
bosses, his hit rate is only 50%
and you can also heal with Lena.
Also, Tiki is a good choice to
deal good damage.

Here is the boss info:

EPILOGUE [EPI]
________


"After Medeus's demise, Doluna
would relax its shadowy grip on
the land and fade into
obscurity: the Empire was
finished. The fires of war that
had raged across Akaneia would
die, and light would come to
take darkness's place. But
before any of that came to pass,
there were a few final moments
of Marth's tale that need
telling...

(DIALOGUE)

Shiida: Marth, you did it. It's
finally over.

Marth: I've waiting a long time
for this day. And now I'm not
entirely certain what to do with
it...

Shiida: Marth...um, we haven't
talked much since leaving Talys.
But I thought.. Do you know
where you will be going?

Marth: To Altea, of course. War
has left my kingdom in ruins. I
cannot waste another day; I must
return to help rebuild.

Shiida: So...I suppose that
means you have bid Talys
farewell for good...

Marth: Don't be silly, Shiida. I
need to at least go thank your
father and tell him the fighting
is done.

Shiida: My father...? Marth, I'm
not asking about my- Never mind.
Please excuse me...

(Shiida leaves and Nyna walks
in)

Nyna: Marth, did something
happen? I just passed Shiida,
and she looked heartbroken...

Marth: No... Well, we were just
talking. And she asked me...

Nyna: Ha ha, oh, Marth... How
can a man who faced the Shadow
Dragon be so desperate to avoid
facing his own feelings?

Marth: I- my- what? I don't know
what you are talking about.

Nyna: You wish to send Shiida
home to Talys, then, and return
to Altea alone? That is what you
want?

Marth: Well, that's where we
both belong. I don't see what my
wants have to do with anything.

Nyna: Clearly not. Marth, if you
have anything to say to Shiida,
say it now. Love cannot always
make the leap from heart to
heart by itself; sometimes you
must speak it aloud and give it
wings. Surely a great leader
like you can muster the courage
for that?

Marth: .....

(Marth leaves and finds Shiida)

Marth: Shiida...might I, er,
have a moment?

Shiida: .....?

Marth: I did not speak with my
heart before. When I said I
would go to Altea, I... Well, I
had meant... I hoped you would
be at my side.

Shiida: .....!

Marth.: As you said, we have not
spoken much since Talys. With
you, I felt I never had to say a
word. If the battle started to
take its toll, you were always
there...close by...I would see
you there, so beaut- ahem, so
brave... and I would,
um,....derive! Yes, derive great
strength! Derive...

....Ugh, why is this so
difficult?! Shiida, I'm just
trying to tell you I-

Shiida: Marth... Shh. Me too...
Me to. [Just in case you are an
ignorant gamer, they just
confessed their interest]

(END DIALOGUE)


"So concludes the tale of
Falchion, blade of light; Marth,
its wielder; and his battle with
the Shadow Dragon. Herein its
events have been chronicled,
that none may ever forget."

small shop. He was to be
married; but in the end his
fellow knights were his most
steadfast companions.

outland garrison. The people
there soon came to love their

brother.


Wrys - Altean Healer

Wrys built a monastery and spent
his remaining years caring for
children who had lost their

marrying.


Barst - The Hatchet

Barst briefly enlisted in the

by some accounts.


Bord - The Lopper

Bord returned to his peaceful

After helping Marth stamp out
the fires of war, Merric
returned to Khodain where he
continued his magical studies.


Matthis - Dashing Noble

Matthis left the army in favor
of a dull and predictable life
in Medon; to him, bliss.


Hardin - Coyote

Nyna offered Hardin her hand in

Bantu - Fire Dragon

Bantu sealed the dragonstones'
power and disappeared, but his
wish was to live out his years
in the Dolunian countryside.


Caeser - Hired Sword

History lost track of Caesar
after the war. Perhaps he found
work as a bodyguard; or perhaps
some country made him a general.


Radd - Lady-Killer

Radd fell in love during the
war, and gave up his sword to
win the woman's heart. Whether
he succeeded, we shall never
know.


Roger - Still Single

Jeorge worked diligently to
rebuild Akaneia. Later, he was
chosen from the palace's heights
to become archer-captain.

Beck became famous for
subjugating a group of
borderland rebels who- having

Akaneia's free company. He was
given Mercurius and with it
carved quite a name for himself.


Palla - Elder Sister

The war left this ones self-
assured knight's heart in knots;
but Palla still worked
diligently at rebuilding Medon.


Catria - Middle Sister

Catria returned to Medon to
rebuild. Love for a certain man
flared in her heart... then
flickered when it went
unrequited.


Arran - Free Paladin

Arran became Captain of Altea's
knights. His efforts helped many
a town rise from the ashes after
the war.


Samson - Assuring Hero

Samson continued to ply his
blade as a mercenary, but never
sold his sword to any but those
who met his standards.


Xane - ShapeShifter

After the war, Xane left without
a word. It was not until later
that Marth learned his true
identity.


Est - Little Sister

Est fell in love with an Altean
knight, and found that the path
of the heart was a surer route
to happiness than that of the
spear.


Tiki - Dragon Scion

Tiki lived a peaceful lie with
Bantu. She spoke fondly of her
adventures with Marth, even long
after they had ended.


Lorenz - People's Man

Lorenz put Grust's prince upon
the throne and became his
regent, but he and Akaneia did
not always see eye to eye.


Elice - Life Giver

Elice returned to Altea with
Marth. Ever serene, she stood by
her bother and watched him grow
into a fine leader.


Gotoh - White Sage

At Nyna's request, Gotoh became
archmage of Akaneia. The world
never knew a better teacher.


Frey - Brave Knight

Frey stayed in Altea to help
rebuild his ravaged kingdom.


Norne - The Volunteer

Her stint as a warrior over,
Norne returned to her home in
Altea and lied an unremarkable
but happy life.


Athena - Vun Voman

Vere she vent, nobody knows...
One theory is that Athena
returned to the border village
where she was born.


Horace - Man Of Worth

Nyna pardoned Horace after the
war, and he resumed his life as
a landed noble. In the years to
come, he worked hard to heal
Akaneia.


Etzel - Spell Slinger

The spell slinger Etzel vanished
after the war as quickly as he
came. His wanderings took him
around the world for years to
come.


Ymir - No Monster

The fighting done, Ymir returned
to his village in Grust: the one
place that had accepted him. He
was content the rest of his
days.


Nagi - Holy Avatar

Marth would have thanked Nagi
after Medeus fell, but there was
no one there to thank. Had she
returned home? None ever knew.

Gaiden Chapters [CHPGAID]

-_-_-_-_
Foreword [CHPA]
_-_-_-_-

Gaiden Chapters are optional
levels in this game. They only
occur a few times after various
chapters. The requirement for
all but one of them is that you
need to have less than 15
characters alive.

The last chapter (24X) requires
that you have a certain
character dead and to not have a
certain weapon.

Please note that it is not
advised to go for gaiden
chapters on your first run.

Each gaiden chapter has a
recruitable unit.

I recommend running a clean file
if you want to play the gaiden
chapters. However, gaiden
chapters are most useful for the
players who have lost many
units.

Between gaiden chapters, I will
briefly summarize the method on
how to beat the chapter. Note
that you can find this
information in the main section,
but this is here because there
are some differences and
optional paths that you can
take. For example, instead of
recruiting a useless character,
you could just kill him for
experience.

At the beginning of some
chapters, having too few units
will make some generic units
join you. These units have
relatively low stats, no
portrait (meaning they
technically aren't a real unit),
no dialogue, basic weapons, and
basically are just good for
luring and nothing else.


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Recommended Party [CHPB]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


1) Marth
2) Abel
3) Frey
4) Gordin/Norne
5) Ogma
6) Shiida
7) Nabarl/Athena (Athena is
   obtained in Chapter 6x)
8) Merric
9) Beck
10) Lena
11) Julian
12) Wolf/Sedgar
13) Bantu (not to actually use
    him, but to recruit Tiki who
    might pose a threat
as an enemy)

The last two are open spots for
whomever you find taste for.
Here are some options:

A) Minerva B) Bantu (Tiki is out
of the question since she must
be dead for 24X to occur) C)
Nabarl/Athena (whomever you
decided to not use) D)
Wolf/Sedgar (whomever you
decided to not use) E)
Gordin/Norne (again^^) F) Horace
(Lorenz comes too late to be of
any use)

Before Chapter 6X [CHPC]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


Beat the Prologue fast, choose
Marth and two other horsemen.
Give them the exp

Since we need to have less than
15 units to access the Gaiden
chapters, we will need to kill
some units. Starting in the
third battle of Prologue, kill
off any character that you do
not want.

***Make sure to keep one unit to

Make sure that you have killed
off all but 4 units by the end
of Prologue. If you did so, then
you will get an archer by the
name of Norne at the end of
Prologue IV.

Here is her dialogue (since you
probably didn't get her on your
first run)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Norne: Draug, sir! The enemy has
crossed the border from the
west! They'll be upon us soon!

Draug: Right, we're on our way.

(Enter Marth)

Draug: Sire, this is Norne. She
caught wind of our struggle and
wishes to fight for Altea.

Norne: Prince Marth, 'tis an
honor. By your leave, though,
I'll be savin' the curtsy-
bobbin' for later. Quickly,
sire!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------

I don't recommend Draug, let him
die next battle. As for Norne,
she is a good alternative to
Gordin. I would pick one out of
the two to keep. Personally,
since I like the try new units
on my different runs, I chose
Norne instead of Gordin.

Let the enemies kill the archer
you didn't choose.

Wrys is gotten in Chapter 1.
He...isn't advised neither. Kill
him.

A whole bunch of units are
gotten in Chapter 2. Keep Ogma
and maybe Barst. Other than
that, let the units die. Recruit
Castor and Darros (and then
prompt- ly let them die) or just
kill them for experience.

In Chapter 3, both Lena, Nabarl,
and Julian are good units to
keep.

At the start of Chapter 4, you
should be given 4 free units
since you seem to lack in units.
No worries, just kill them off
too!

You also get Merric in the
village in Chapter 4, keep him.

In Chapter 5, you get quite a
few units also. Wendell, Hardin,
Vyland, Roshea are all the units
you DO NOT want. Keep either
Wolf or Sedgar.

In Chapter 6, Rickard is
useless. I wouldn't even bother
recruiting him, but he is good
experience.

Before you finish Chapter 6,
make sure you have less than 15
units. Time for the first Gaiden
chapter!

In War's Grip [CHPC1]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"Not long after Marth's army
freed the kingdom of Aurelis,
messengers arrived from a
western village to plea for the
prince's help. Pirates had
struck the war-torn village at
its weakest and abducted its
children. Marth could not ignore
such an injustice, and rode with
his army to the rescue..."


The recruitable character for
this battle is Athena. Use her
if you don't like Nabarl.

At the beginning of the
battle...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Elder: Athena! My lady, wait!
Where are you going all by
yourself? This is madness!

Athena: Vy vould you vant to
stop us? Your children vere
taken by the pirates. Ve are
offering to go get them back.

Elder: But you're barely
recovered! If you try to fight
the pirates in that state,
you'll only-

Athena: Only vat? Die? If your
villagers had not pulled us from
the sea, ve vould have been
svallowed by the vaves anyway.
That is the least ve can do. Vat
sort of selfish creature do you
take us for?

Elder: But there's no way you
can stop them! There's only one
of you-er, yous. Look, please,
just wait a little longer. I've
sent our younger folk to find
help. Give them a chance to
return!

Athena: ...Very well. Ve vill
vait for this "help". But if no
vun comes, make no mistake: ve
vill not sit idly by.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The enemies in this battle
aren't anything special, just be
sure to have a healer ready at
all times.

The first turn, just move
everyone forward. You should be
attacked by about 5 enemies.
Wipe them out and then you can
heal yourself before proceeding.

Use an archer to lure/kill the
archer on the island.

Next, you can either charge the
south or the north. I would go
to the north personally since
there is the village there.

A mage from the south approaches
the village when you do so. Use
an archer again to lure/kill the
mage.

Keep luring in as many units
until you feel that there is no
risk in rushing the area. I
would say 3+ units is dangerous
for most of our units at this
point in the game (unless of
course you use a high-defence
unit to rush).

Visit the village when you get a
chance.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Athena: Vell, vell...You must be
the help. Ve vish to fight vith
you.

Marth: Ah, splendid. How many of
you? Gather your men, and we'll
be on our way at once.

Athena: Men? Ve are a woman. Vun
voman! Are you blind, stupid
manchild?

Marth: Vat? ...Ahem, what? Oh.
Right, pardon me. I, uh, I am
Marth, prince of Altea. I heard
pirates took the village
children, so I brought my army
straight away.

Athena: ...If you say so. Ve are
called Athena. The vee vuns have
been visked away to a castle
south of here. Come. Ve have a
fair bit of skill vith a sword;
hopefully the same can be said
of you, Marth of Altea.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


The rest is a matter of taking
your time and luring in units
with an archer. The boss is easy
too...

Seize the gate...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Boy: *sniff* I wanna go home...

Girl: Thanks, mister.

Elder: Prince Marth, bless you,
bless you...I haven't the words
to express our gratitude. We are
ready to abandon all hope, but
you came to our aid when no one
else would, when you did not
have to.

I know today's battle means
little when the entire world is
at war. History may not remember
it- but we will. Our village
will speak of your feats for
generations to come.

(Screen flashes to conversation
between Athena and Marth)

Athena: Marth. Ve have decided
to go vith you.

Marth: You have?

Athena: It is the least ve can
do. Vat sort of selfish creature
do you take us for? Ve vill join
you, and you vill be grateful.
Do ve make ourselves clear?

Marth: P-perfectly clear,
Athena. Your swordsmanship will
turn the tides in many a battle
to come.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Save the game and note that the
next gaiden chapter is 12X.


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_
Before Chapter 12X [CHPD]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


In Chapter 7, just beat it
normal. Just remember that you
can't recruit Minerva yet. Also
watch for the reinforcements in
the south forts.

In Chapter 8, you get those weak
units at the start. Do the
normal, dispose of them. Roger,
the recruitable knight, isn't
necessary. Watch the
reinforcements at the top. Also
remember to buy some stuff from
the shop.

In Chapter 9, you get the sniper
(or you could just let the thief
kill the village) . Get rid of
him also...and any other useless
unit you may have still.
Remember to get the treasure and
watch out for the sheer number
of enemies.

In Chapter 10, just play
normally. Get your first Master
Seal and then recruit and keep
(optional) Minerva. I personally
dislike her in favor of a
promoted Shiida. Anyhow, just
watch for the main army's
advance. Get rid of Maria also.

In Chapter 11, remember to watch
for the ballistas. Recruit
Linde. Use her if you want, I
don't like her in favor of
Merric. Remember that the
manakete is unrecruitable. Also
remember that Jake can be
recruited, but Beck is a better
choice. Other than that, just
watch the ballistas.

In Chapter 12, all the units in
the jail are pretty much
useless. Let them die so you
don't have to worry about
accidentally leaving them alive.
Note that the next gaiden
chapter is after this.
Therefore, make sure you have
less than 15 characters left.
Also remember to use a thief to
get the chests.

Time for the second gaiden!

A Traitor's Worth [CHPD1]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_


"After taking back the palace,
the League rode across Akaneia,
freeing the greater part of the
kingdom as they went- all except
the west. A landed knight there
named Horace, who had betrayed
Akaneia, to join Doluna,
continued to stubbornly hold out
against Marth's forces. Nyna
could not fathom why such a
fiercely loyal knight would turn
to treachery, but with her other
knights calling for Horace's
blood, she had no choice but to
give in and ask Marth to bring
the traitor to justice."


This battle is pretty linear,
there are two villages to visit.
When you begin the map, Dejanira
will approach Horace into
dialogue.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Dejanira: Have you heard,
Horace? I am told the rebels
just recaptured the palace. That
accursed Akaneian wench! Never
mind Camus's pleas. We should
have put her to the sword with
the rest of them...

Horace: .....

Dejanira: Hm, something
bothering you, now? Don't tell
me you are toying with the idea
of rejoining your motherland?
Because if you do, I think you
know exactly what will befall
your people.

Horace: Yes, you've made it
quite clear! I am an Akaneian
knight no longer. I knew this
day would come when I gave me
lance to Doluna. I will not
flinch.

Dejanira: Good. Then gather your
soldiers and kill these rebels
before they cause any more
trouble.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


First turn, kill the two
immediate enemies then move your
WHOLE army to the right. In
order to recruit Horace, you
must beat the chapter without
killing him. Don't worry...

After you finish your first
turn, dialogue moves to the
enemies.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy soldier: Lord Horace, our
soldiers are in position.

Horace: Good.

Enemy soldier: Shall we advance
on the enemy?

Horace: ...No. That won't be
necessary. We'll lure them in
close, then strike. No one
attacks unless the enemy makes a
move first. Is that clear?

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


This means that the whole middle
section of enemies won't attack
unless you do. Sounds good if
you want to recruit Horace, just
sneak up the right and beat the
boss.

Note that the easy way to see if
an unit will not attack is see
if they are from Grust or
Akaneia. If Akaneia, they won't
attack. If Grust, they will.

The enemies along the way aren't
anything special. Three mages
will rush from the north, but
they are easy enough. Check out
the villages with Marth though.

First one...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Elder: Lord Horace, who rules
this land, used to be a knight
of Akaneia. After the palace
fell, though, he bent his knee
to the Dolunian emperor and has
been servin' him ever since. For
that, folks call him a traitor
and say he tarnished his
knightly brethren's reputation.
Well, that's a load of hogwash.
He broke his knightly oaths to
protect us! Not 'cause he's some
traitor.

Please, sire, you have to help
clear his name. Here...Lord
Horace's father, bless him, gave
me this weapon as a gift long
ago. I know he'd be glad to see
it used to restore his son's
honor.

(OBTAINED KILLER LANCE)

END DIALOGUE

Move along up, kill manakete
then visit the second village...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Villager: Are you with the
League? Please, sir, I'm beggin'
ya...You have to help Lord
Horace. He's always looked out
for us small folk, before and
after he inherited the land.
He's a pillar of strength, he
is. We'd be dead if he hadn't
made the tough choices he did.
The least we can do is rescue
him from his plight now. Here,
I've got this magic tome one of
our villagers found after the
last battle on our soil. You
take it, and find some way to
save him. Promise!

(OBTAINED BLIZZARD)

END DIALOGUE

Now, just move the units in to
kill the boss...some pirate
reinforcements should spawn in
the west first though.

Note that if done properly, the
pirate reinforcements shouldn't
even have caused a problem. Of
course, you could kill them for
experience or you could just
seize the gate.

Upon seizing the gate...(and
without killing Horace)


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Horace: What!? Dejanira's been
killed?! Then...it's over.
Soldiers! Lay down your weapons!
No more Akaneian blood shall be
shed! ...Mine shall be the last.

(Screen moves to castle)

Horace: Bravo, Prince Marth. I
yield. Spare the lives of my
soldiers and treat my people
kindly, and you may do with me
as you see fit.

(Enter villager)

Villager: No! Wait, please! Lord
Horace is a good man! Doluna
threatened him, said they'd raze
the land corner to corner if he
didn't comply. So you see-

Horace: Hush! You've said
enough.

Marth: But, Lord Horace...

Horace: I betrayed my fellow
knights and besmirched their
good name. I will not dress up
my sins as kindnesses! I accept
my punishment. Allow me to die a
knight's death.

(Enter Nyna)

Nyna: I will not!

Horace: .....! Princess Nyna?

Nyna: Horace. I heard what you
said. And you have it quite
right. Your crimes deserve
death, or worse.

Marth: Nyna, what are you-

Nyna: But I shall give you no
knight's death. I shall give you
a traitor's life You say you
will not dress up your sins. I
say you will not run from them
either.

Horace: Your Highness...! Are
you saying you wish me to live?

Nyna: You did all in your power
to protect these people. That
was honorable, Horace. But if
you die today, no one will
remember you for anything but
your one act of betrayal. Your
soldiers will have to bear that
shame in your stead. Do you call
that justice?

Horace: .....

Nyna: Starting today, you shall
prove to the world there was
value in your actions. Show us a
traitor's worth. Show us what
the soldiers who fought and died
for you saw to be true.

Horace: I...I do not know what
to say.

Nyna: I have claimed your life,
Horace. You have no say. You
shall fight for us...and you
shall not die. I forbid it.

Horace: Heh...Very well, Your
Highness. As you command...

Before Chapter 17X [CHPE]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


In Chapter 14, let both Palla
and Catria die. Remember to
watch for the many
reinforcements.

In Chapter 15, remember to run
quickly from Gharnef. Then,
remember to get the treasure at
the bottom right corner.

In Chapter 16, choose whether
you want to keep Xane or not. I
find him not worth the
trouble...also don't bother
sending anyone to the left side.
Arran and Samson are horrible
anyway, unless you want to let
one just wither away at the top
4 reinforcements until he dies.

In Chapter 17, remember to take
the left side out before the
right side. Also remember that
the manaketes are difficult but
give good exp. Be sure to watch
for the reinforcements and also
to check the secret shop on this
map.

At the end of Chapter 17, make
sure to have less than 15 units
for the gaiden.

"At long last, Altea was free
again. Marth took the League to
Helena Castle in the north, an
old fortress and key supply
point during Doluna and Grust's
occupation. There he meant to
seize the last of the enemy's
gold and provisions but Grust
would not give up the castle
without a fight..."


This battle features many new
ideas. Thieves and long ranged
units are advised most.
Especially thieves.

At the beginning of the chapter:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy Soldier: Lord Dactyl, I've
brought the mage.

Dactyl: Good. Hold him up.

(Enter Etzel)

Etzel: ...Nngh....

Dactyl: Well, then? Have you
been persuaded to fight for us?

Etzel: ...Never. I'd rather die.

Dactyl: You'd rather DIE? Ha! As
if a spell-slinging vagabond
like you has any choice in the
matter! Enough. Strip him of all
his possessions and lock him up
someplace. Perhaps we can use
him later.

Enemy: There's not much to strip
him of, milord. Just the tome
and this ring...

Dactyl: Ring? Let me have a look
at that.

Etzel: No! Don't you- Grr, let
me go! Don't you touch Ursula's
ring!

Dactyl: Wha...what are you-
yaagh!

Enemy Soldier: O-oi! Take you
hands off Lord Dactyl!

Etzel: Rrgh...please, not the
ring! ...Give it BACK!

Dactyl: Unhand me, you filthy
maggot!

Etzel: Nngh! ...Unnh...

Dactyl: Take this wretch away.
Now!

Enemy Soldier: At once, milord!

Dactyl: Hmph, all that for some
tawdry ring. ...Hmm? That gives
me an idea...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


For the first turn, don't bother
trying to lure in the ranged
units. They won't go for the
bait.

All units should move forward.
You might want to consider
leaving them out of enemy range,
but this is up to you. On the
enemy's turn, all knights and
cavaliers will rush toward you,
and after the turn, dialogue
appears:


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Enemy Soldier: I've brought him,
milord.

Dactyl: Good. I've had a change
of heart. I am considering
giving that ring of yours back.

Etzel: ....!

Dactyl: BUT...you must face the
League for us. How much
considering I do hinges on how
well you fight.

Etzel: ...And how am I to fight
unarmed, my lord?

Dactyl: Hmm? ...Ah. yes, well,
you can have your little book
back. But you know what the
consequences will be if you
betray us...

(Etzel leaves)

Etzel: For now, I'll just have
to feign obedience...

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


First thing to do is clear the
immediate Knight/Cavalier
problem. This is easy since your
whole main army should have
advanced.

You are probably wondering about
Etzel, who happens to be the
recruitable character for this
chapter. You gain him by
clearing the chapter before
killing him, like the chapter
with Horace.

There are a whole bunch of rooms
that seem to have some
interesting stuff in
them...hmmm, use your thief to
check them out.

Use the save orb if you want,
then use the thieves in the next
few turns to check out the left
three rooms.

Let us start with the top one
and move down.

Yay for us, first room contains
chests. This one contains a
Warp. Let's go to the next room
down.

Enemy ambush! Manakete, pretty
simple still. There's only one
of him.

Moving logically down to the
third and final room, we are
greeted by a mage and a chest. A
poleax resides in the chest. Yay
for us, now to go to the rest of
the map.

On turn 10 however, the enemy
seems to have different plans.
Three paladins spawn on the
bottom. The forefront paladin
wields a Killer Lance, something
you might not want to mess with.
I suggest luring them in and
then using long ranged attacks.

If you lured them in, then the
turn you finished killing them
will also have three more of the
same paladins spawning in. This
would be Turn 14.

On Turn 17, three more will
appear. Same deal as before.

Turn 17 yields the last
reinforcements of the battle.
Now we can go back to raiding
the west side.

The northwest room seems to be a
good spot to raid first. Bring
out thief over and open it to
find a bishop with Elfire and a
chest containing a Longbow.

The next corridor may pose a
small problem for some units. It
seems that they are infested
with long ranged units. Simple
enough however, just lure in a
few at a time. Then, heal from
the rough damage then lure in
some more.

Note: A good place to safely
pick off one unit at a time if
you are scared of losing a unit
is the small indent in the wall.
Use the danger button to find
how far away you can be before
you are attacked then quickly
rush the unit into the indent.
Kill a few units then
retreat/heal and then continue.

When the immediate enemies that
attack you on their free will
are gone, you are left with a
sort of trap. An archer resides
behind the walls, but to attack
him you need either a longbow or
to just regularly attack.

However, there is a small
problem. A manakete is waiting
at the bottom to attack your
ranged unit if you decide to do
the latter. Also, a bishop is
also waiting to kill your unit.

Below, a sniper with a dangerous
killer bow is ready to take out
any unit with a critical. Use a
cavalier to kill him fast.
However, this will trigger the
hero to attack you along with a
weak cavalier. Actually, the
hero is pretty weak too, no need
to worry about him.

Now, we reach the part with
Etzel in our path. Selecting him
with A yields us the following
information: He won't move. Yet
he has a tome and will attack.

In the course of testing this
out so as to put it in the
guide, I had a near encounter
with a sniper. Turns out that if
you approach the hallway Etzel
is in with a ranged unit, you
can trigger the door to open and
the sniper to attack you through
the walls.

With this piece of information,
feel free to pick the archer
off. Also, kill the two
mercenaries that will rush right
after you trigger the door to
open.

Also, take out the mercenary
above, then put some units
around the lower-left door. DO
NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID
AND OPEN THE DOOR WHEN YOU DO
NOT HAVE AT LEAST TWO STRONG
UNITS NEARBY WHO STILL ARE ABLE
TO MOVE THIS TURN.

There are three units behind the
door, a knight and two bishops.
Combined, the two bishops can
team on your thief and kill him
pretty easily.

Open the chest in the same room
for a weird sword called the Wo
Dao.

At the end of all this, the boss
should be the only one left
along with Etzel.

Leave Etzel alone and make sure
to pass him without getting in
his range. There is a chest to
the southwest of the boss, open
it to get a Wing Spear. Yay for
us.

Time for boss...ranged attacks
work well on him. Of course,
Wing Spear or using a Rapier
does too.

DIALOGUE

Malledus: Prince Marth! Grust's
garrison left their war chest
when they fled. This much gold
should buy plenty of equipment.
Might I suggest, sire, you avail
yourself of this opportunity to
outfit your soldiers? Our next
opponent will be Grust's Sable
Order. By our scouts' reports,
they march to meet us as we
speak. Many say their knights
are the strongest on the
continent. We'll want to be well
prepared.

(Enter Etzel)

Etzel: You're Prince Marth,
aren't you? I wish to thank you.

Marth: ...Who are you?

Etzel: My name is Etzel. I am a
traveling sorcerer. Those
Grustian cowards stole a ring
from me, and were it not for
you, I might never have seen it
again

Marth: The ring must have been
very dear to you, then.

Etzel: It's all I have to
remember my wife by. She got
caught in the fighting back when
Gra betrayed Altea...

Marth: Those were dark days. You
have my deepest sympathies; I
lost my father in the same
battle.

Etzel: Will there be no end to
this bloodshed?

Marth: There will, Etzel. I have
sworn to end it; that's the very
reason all of us fight.

Etzel: And you think you can end
it, just like that? From anyone
else's lips that would sound
absurdly naive. But I can tell
you are sincere. Tell me,
Prince, have you any need for an
extra...spell slinger? I've no
taste for war, but I do have a
fierce hunger for ending it.
Let's usher in a new era, you
and I.

Save and it's back to the
regular chapters.

Before Chapter 20X [CHPF]
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

For Chapter 18, remember that
Ridersbane/Poleaxes are
invaluable. Est joins your army,
but dispose of her. Also, I
wouldn't keep Etzel from last
chapter in favor of Merric.

For Chapter 19, remember to get
all the chests. Get both orbs
also and recruit Tiki with Bantu
(it's easier this way to get
Chapter 24X).

For Chapter 20, use master seals
from previous chapter. Then,
just rinse this map as if it
were a normal run. Lorenz is
pretty much useless compared to
Horace. Kill him instead of
recruiting (or recruit then feed
him to Camus) Be sure to have
only 15 units left, then to the
gaiden!

attempt to hang on to their
lives, took all the residents of
a nearby village hostage to keep
Marth from striking. However,
they could not have picked a
worse village to harass..."


Only unit that you should really
bring is a thief. Units that
move farther are an asset in
this battle. Also, weapons that
deal with Manaketes/Cavaliers
well make it a cakewalk.

Begin the battle.

DIALOGUE

Larissa: Have the villagers
given up struggling yet?

Enemy soldier: With that ogre on
the loose? Hardly, sir. All of
our soldiers together still
can't contain him. The other
villagers have fled into the
caverns, out of reach.

Larissa: What? Grr, enough of
this! The League will be here
soon. Take your positions! We'll
deal with them first and cut
that giant down to size later.

(Camera moves elsewhere)

Villager: Ymir, you're hurt!

Ymir: Am I? I hardly feel it.

Elder: Why would you try to take
on an entire army just for our
sake?

Ymir: Because you treat me like
a human being. Do I need another
reason?

Villager: Ymir...thank you.

Ymir: I'll be standing guard
outside the cavern. Nobody will
hurt you, I swear it.

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Indeed Ymir, the recruitable
character, is standing guard. He
is on the upper right side of
the map. He doesn't move, and
you should talk to him with
Marth when possible.

However, it is more pressing to
deal with other threats first.
Also, I wouldn't advise opening
any chests until you pretty much
cleared the map.

Split your army into two
parties. One to the left and one
down the middle. Both paths have
a considerable amount of danger,
so be sure to put good units in
both parties.

The left side will engage in
fighting first. The broken
bridge is a perfect place to
have a paladin or two.

Meanwhile, two paladins and a
cavalier will be rushing the
middle. Kill them and most
likely, you will trigger the
three relatively strong generals
to fight

Defeat them the next turn, and
then move a units with a large
movement (like a horseman) to
the right and kill the manakete.
Ymir should be right there,
standing guard.

Talking with Marth and...


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Marth: Who are you? You don't
seem to be one of Grust's
soldiers.

Ymir: You just keep your
distance. I'm not letting anyone
near the villagers in here, and
that includes you!

Marth: You wrong me, sir. I'm
here to rout the last of Grust's
army. To save you.

Ymir: Yeah? Well, they said the
same thing when they led us down
here. And look where that got
us. I'm not fallin' for the same
lies twice!

Marth: I speak the truth. But,
if my word is not good enough,
so be it. Stand aside and watch
us fight. Let the battle prove I
mean what I say. Agreed? Either
way, you are in danger here.
Take the villagers and hide
until this is over.

Ymir: ...So I'm supposed to just
sit here, when I could be
fightin'?

Marth: Just give me a chance to
prove I'm here to protect you.

Ymir: ...Fine. I'll stay out of
it. For now. But if I find
you're lyin' to me, I'll split
you right down the middle!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


For the left party, you should
have confronted with a mass of
paladins moving in from the
northern part of the map. They
are relatively weak, all of them
only have steel swords/lances.

The manakete there should be
taken out with care from a use
of a Dragonpike.

Now, the whole map should be
clear of every enemy except the
boss and the two bishops near
him. Before, worrying about
them, let's get all the chests.

First, the island to the left
(first island that your left
party came upon) has a Killer
Lance.

Moving onto the island that had
the manakete, there's a killer
bow in that.

Now, moving onto the island that
Ymir was on, there are two
chests there, they have a Wo Dao
and a Killer Axe.

The two remaining chests are
near the boss, so we can't
access them just yet.

Instead, move your units and
Marth to the upper-left. Use a
paladin or unit with long range
(Shiida works) to kill both
bishops in one turn.

Then, we can access the two
chests. They have a poleax and a
Longbow.

Now onto the boss:

--------------------------------
BOSS: Larissa
HP: 32

Weapon: Silver Lance
Drop: None

Beginning Quote: "We'll never
surrender to you Akaneian
rabble! Long live Grust!"

End Quote: "Rebel...scum..."

--------------------------------

This boss is easily killed by
long range attacks, but
Armorslayers and such weapons
work too.

Seize the throne and you will
get dialogue.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Elder: Prince Marth, thank you.
Those soldiers told us they'd
protect us when they led us down
here...but they were just using
us as leverage, hostages to keep
you at bay! If you hadn't shown
up, they might have just killed
us outrig- ht in the end...

(Screen moves to where Ymir was)

Ymir: Prince Marth, sorry I
doubted you.

Marth: Well, at least we've
cleared up the misunderstanding.

Ymir: Since you came to the
villagers' rescue, how 'bout I
help you out as a way of sayin'
thanks?

Marth: You mean...join our army?

Ymir: I'm strongest in the land!
Well, second strongest, at
least. I can hold my own in
battle. But if you don't want a
monster in your ranks, I
understand..

Marth: Monster? You're a giant
among men, to be sure, but a
hero as well! Any warrior who
can fend of an entire army is
welcome among us!

Ymir: Then count me in! Let's
see how many more armies break
themselves against me, eh!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------

End of gaiden. Next one is
Chapter 24X, for this one you
need to kill Tiki off and not
have the Falchion. More about
this later.


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_
Before Chapter 24X [CHPG]
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


There is no more need to kill
units, the last gaiden chapter
does not require less than 15
units. You basically can fulfill
the requirement for Chapter 24X
in about one battle.

For Chapter 21, the only part to
remember is the sheer number of
reinforcements

For Chapter 22, you have a
choice. You can either keep the
two orbs (they are useful) or
you can get Starlight. If you
keep the orbs, you might have to
worry next chapter. I recommend
getting Starlight, since the
orbs aren't necessary to beat
the game. However, this is up to
you.

The battle itself is not hard.

For Chapter 23, first bring Tiki
in. The way you play depends on
what you chose above. If you got
Starlight, use Warp to bring
Merric or a mage over to the top
left corner. Attack the Gharnef
there. IF it is the real one,
quickly restart and try again
until it's a fake. Once you kill
the fake, warp over units,
including Marth. Kill the boss
with a cavalier then seize the
gate fast.

ALTERNATELY, you can keep
restarting the chapter until the
Gharnef to the south-east is the
real one. That way you can
freely kill the other two on the
top and seize the gate.

If you kept the orbs, restart
the chapter until the first
Gharnef is fake. Clear that,
then slowly but surely defeat as
many units above. Finally, warp
in a strong unit, kill the boss.
Then, warp in Marth and seize
the throne.

For Chapter 24, just play like
normal and remember to get the
Aum staff (you can revive Tiki
after 24X)

________________________________
Note: If you kill Tiki off in
Chapter 24 WITH the Falchion on
her, you will find it in the
storage AND still be able to get
24X.

(Steps, thanks to Arashi-Kun)

1- Get Tiki with Bantu 2- Get
the real Falchion 3- Get to
Chapter 24 4- Give Falchion to
Tiki 5- Have Tiki die holding
Falachion 6- Continue and get
into Chapter 24X 7- In Chapter
24X, look in the convoy,
Falchion is there! 8- Finish
Chapter 24X, getting Nagi and
the second Falchion 9- Go into
the next chapter! 10- Revive
Tiki [with Aum staff]

"Marth did as Gotoh instructed
and chose soldiers for his
journey into the unseen. What
lay within the tower in this
alternate world to test him?
Marth's heart wavered. But with
neither the divine blade
Falchion nor the divine dragon
girl to aid him, the tower's
master was his last hope of
defeating Medeus.

Gotoh had told Marth to find a
coffin. So while most of his
companions remained in the
material world to battle Doluna,
Marth and his chosen few scoured
the tower to search of a
mysterious savior."


Best units as always, one thief
can help a bit. Not much more.
Start the Fight.

DIALOGUE

Marth: This must be the tower
Lord Gotoh spoke of...

Malledus: Sire, it's teeming
with soldiers...Who are they?
They fly no recogni- zable
banner.

Marth: They are the Keepers
whose test I must pass.

Malledus: You mean to fight
them, then?

Marth: Gotoh says we must prove
ourselves. Very well; we'll
seize the tower. Follow me!

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


Upon first inspections of the
enemies on this map, you will
notice that the usual
recruitable character is absent.
This is due to the fact that you
get him AFTER the map.

First move, send units to defeat
the Heroes. After this, lure in
some of the next few units and
defeat them also. I would use
Sedgar with a bow to lure them
in (he'll take out the mages and
the rest of our units can deal
with the melee)

Next, I would wait a bit for the
enemy to advance on the left
flank. In the meanwhile, just
rush the left side and slaughter
all opposition.

By the time you reach the top
(with the Manakete), the left
should start having problems.
However, just blockade the
corridor with a unit with a
ranged bow. Put an archer behind
that unit. Your setup should
look as follows:

  EEE|                        LE
  EBE|
   |R|______             ---/___
---|A                    A = you
   -----	         R = Your block
			 E = Regular enemy (1 ranged)
B = The one enemy that has a bow

I personally used my berserker,
Barst, as the blockade. Norne
was my archer. Basically, you
damage their unit on your turn.
On their turn, they will deal a
bit of damage to Barst, but not
anything close to killing him.
The ranged unit should attack
and be killed on the
counterstrike (this
counterstrike along with your
attack is by far enough).

Next thing to do is to eliminate
the enemy directly in front of
Barst and then rush in with
Sedgar, Wolf, Marth...any strong
unit. This combined attack
should defeat the immediate
threat.

The rest is all too easy. The
two bishops near the chests are
simply weak and deal low damage
to my paladin (who only has 6
RES).

The two units on the top, near
the throne, will rush you once
you get close. The manakete
isn't really a threat, since he
won't attack you even if you get
in close attacking range. After
getting rid of the all but the
throne, swing your thief around
and grab the chests.

Chest contents include:

1) Aura
2) Excalibur

After this, the boss should be
the only one left. He is a joke,
not even worthy of getting a
name. Wyrmslayer, Dragonpike, or
range him to death.

Seize the gate.


--------------------------------
DIALOGUE

Malledus: Sire, look! Stairs
beneath the throne! Where could
they lead?

(Screen blackens then reappears
in different area)

Malledus: ...Do you think this
is the coffin?

Marth: There are no others. And
look: these markings around it
are the same pattern we saw in
the Fane of Raman...

Malledus: Hmm, you're right...

Marth: We found a dragon girl in
the fane...I wonder if these
symbols- Huh?!

Malledus: Sire! The
coffin...It's opening!

Marth: What? No! It must be some
kind of trap, or...or some kind
of...er...

(Screen flashes and you can see
coffin on the bottom screen)

Marth: ...woman? Could she be
the master Gotoh spoke of?

Nagi: ...Who are you?

Marth: My name is Marth, prince
of Altea. And you, my lady?

Nagi: Me?! My name...is Nagi.

Marth: Nagi...I was sent here to
find you, by a man named Gotoh.

Nagi: Gotoh...I know that
name...But from where? I cannot
recall.

Marth: You've lost your memory?

Nagi: I...cannot say for
certain. But your voice...I
heard you calling. Did you rouse
me from my sleep?

Marth: I...er...Not on purpose?

Nagi: Your soul...called out to
me...begging for my help. For
this blade...

Marth: That...that's Falchion!
How did you get it?!

Nagi: I cannot remember...But
you need it, I know that. And
you need my powers.

Marth: Your...powers, my lady?

Nagi: Take me with you. I
must...finish what I started...I
think. I must fight with you.

(Obtained Falchion)

END DIALOGUE
--------------------------------


This Falchion is weaker than the
one you would have normally
gotten. However, it still is a
strong blade (certain sources
say it has the same power as a
Silver Sword).

Save the game after.

ENDGAME Differences

Finish the game using my ENDGAME
section, it should not be a
whole lot different than this.
One good thing is that Nagi can
deal 45 damage to Medeus.

Also, you won't get Gotoh.
Instead, you have Nagi. She
comments at when the battle
begins.

matter; you've recovered even

Introduction [3A]
_-_-_-_-_-_-


Welcome to the infamous *****
(H5) difficulty. This is by far
the place to go if you are
looking for a challenge in this
game.

The enemies are vastly stronger
and it is basically a struggle
and a test of what you have as a
FE gamer.

Many chapters in this game make
it almost simply impossible to
keep all your units. If units
die in this game, don't bother
trying to restart unless you are
either:

A) Trying to keep them all alive
B) Using said unit for many
tasks

It is actually a good idea to
try and go for gaidens, or at
least a select few.

Now, many readers are probably
trying other difficulties. This
guide is going to tell you how
to do the extreme difficulty. If
it works on the extreme, it must
work on the moderate difficulty
according to logic.

The first few chapters of the H5
difficulty are designed to break
the unwary player's back. In
fact, the first three chapters
are probably the hardest.

Note: Abusing the arena and
other advantages is a sure way
to kill the diffic- ulty in this
mode. For this reason, and for
the reason that some readers
refuse to grind, I will refrain
from doing so.

Some forms of "cheating" are
allowed, ie. plugging up forts
to avoid having to restart.

However, nothing will save your
units from plainly dying. Most
units die fast in the beginning
of the game, one mistake and you
will have to restart.

As a result, fight only on
counterattacks (when possible of
course).

Also rely on indirect attacks
since they cannot be countered
usually.

Note that this guide is not
going to cover how to save every
unit. I will have to concede
some units every so often, save
them if you want. In fact, I
have to get to the gaiden
chapters anyway, so I will be
killing units. You don't have to
follow me if you don't agree
with killing a certain unit, but
just know.


-_-_-_-_-_-
Differences [3B]
_-_-_-_-_-_


This section will also cover
what I am doing differently for
this section.

As I said already, this mode is
much harder. However, the story
remains the same, so I do not
have to repeat what I already
wrote.

However, I will change a short
bit. For one, I WILL be posting
the enemies for each chapter.
This lets the reader be ready.

The format for any chapter is as
follows.

Chapter 1 - Marth Embarks

Enemies: 15 pirates w/ iron axe

Reinforcement: Turn 1-5: 100
cavaliers with Brave Lance Turn
6-10: 1 Boss spawns in at the
armory.

When it comes to the boss I will
make a special section just for
them.

QUITE A FEW IDEAS BELOW GOES TO
THUNDERMAN. He has written a
great H5 guide on the
SerenesForest forums. If you go

Note that his account name there
is not ThunderMan)


Alright, get ready for one of
the toughest battle you will
probably ever play in this game.
The insane difficulty is
indicated when you go ahead and
try to fight the thief. Don't
actually attack, but just check
your options. Notice how the
thief can even double some
units!

First thing to do is use Marth
to get the 10,000 Gold from the
village. Then, use Jagen to get
many Javelins from the Armory.
I'd say 5 would suffice. Next,
distribute them to Shiida,
Draug, and leave the rest to
Jagen.

Yes, that is right. First of
all, Cain only has an E-rank
Lance. That means he can't use
Javelins, yet. Use the Iron
Lance for him throughout this
map. We want him using Javelins
as soon as possible.

Next, you also probably are
wondering why I want to use
Jagen. No, I don't want to keep
him throughout the game, but
note that he is needed to take
the damage for now.

His silver lance is also
something that your will most
likely want to use in this
battle.

Note that I don't think it is
even possible to get through
this battle with all units if
you don't use Jagen. No, not
even an abnormally large amount
of critical hits will save you.

Alright, enough talking and
let's get to the playing. Use
Abel's Javelin to attack the
thief. Should hit him pretty
hard. Next, use Shiida to
attack. At last, use Cain to
finish him off. If any unit
misses their attack, you might
as well restart since you will
be crippled from the damage the
thief will deal.

After that pest is defeated, DO
NOT ADVANCE. In fact, drop most
units back. If a pirate attacks
Gordin, he will double and kill
him. This means you should drop
most weak units back near the
house.

A really good unit to use to
take hits in this battle (other
than Jagen) is Draug. With 11
defence, he only takes 5 damage
out of his 20 max. This lets him
lure in units to the death.

Move whoever is hurt to the fort
near your mass of units briefly,
then send Jagen to the bottom
(near lower village where the
thief was) and equip the Silver
Lance. Leave all units but him
out of range of attack, but move
your able units (Cain, Abel,
Draug, Shiida) to the border of
the enemy attack range.

Next turn, your Jagen should be
attacked by some 1-2 pirates,
clear them out but still keep
your distance since more enemies
are coming. If Jagen is really
hurt at any time, like less than
half his max HP, drop him to the
fort unless he is going to
indirect attack or finish an
enemy off.

The next few turns should yield
a charging pirate mass. This
basically is the game's last
attempt to defeat you early. If
you get by this, you are safe
for the rest of the chapter
(since the other pirates don't
move)

This part also demands luck
since Javelins have a horrible
hit rate (67 or so) This makes
it very hard to calculate how to
defeat an enemy.

A lot of times, you'll end up
having all your able units
teaming on one guy to finally
get him. This is painstakingly
dangerous since 2-3 enemies
flood you at a time.

As a general rule, don't let
anyone but Draug and Jagen take
more than two hits without
healing. Also note that you have
no means to heal yourself other
than the forts. This means that
the fort near you is invaluable.

It is exactly hard to tell you
what to do since the pirates
take separate paths depending on
where your units are. Just
remember to let them come toward
you first, and stay out of their
attack range.

If the coast is clear and there
are only two pirates standing in
the middle island strip, you are
good to advance...However, first
heal all your units at the fort.

Next, bring in all units to the
boundaries of the attack range.
Use Draug to systematically lure
in units. One at a time. Use the
forts to heal him often.

Next, there is the hunter to
take care of. He can double a
few of your units, but as
normal, he is venerable to
direct attacks.

This guy moves on his own. Do
NOT let him attack any unit.
Lure him in far then kill him
with a cavalier.

Move in after and a pirate in
the back will charge. Retreat,
lure this guy in then kill him.

After this, advance yet again.
This time, lure in the two
remaining pirates. Kill them
with sheer numbers, then visit
the village. I wouldn't use
Wyrs, but his Heal is good
enough to keep units alive for
now.

Last thing you need to worry
about is the boss, he is easy...

--------------------------------
BOSS: Gazzak
HP: 35

Weapon: Steel Axe

How to beat: No direct attacks.
In case you didn't hear me, I
said NO FRONT ATTACKS!

Instead, use Javelins and such
to take him down. When killed,
you get your first Vulnerary.
--------------------------------


If you made it so far, good job.
A few more chapters then the
difficulty curve drops.


-_-_-_-_-
Chapter 2 - Pirates of Galder
[HM2]
_-_-_-_-_


Enemies: Boss w/ Hand Axe
2 Thieves w/ Iron Sword
2 Hunter w/ Iron Bow
2 Cavalier w/ Iron Sword
8 Pirates w/ Iron Axe

Reinforcement: None

Recruitable: Darros w/ Steel Axe
Castor w/ Iron Bow


This chapter's hardest part is
the beginning. You will struggle
trying to fend off an attack
from both sides.

In three turn time, two
cavaliers will arrive from the
west. These guys are definitely
a pain if you haven't cleared
the north threat yet. I
restarted many times due to
them.

Because of this, we need to be
free of threats from the north.

However, there lingers a
problem. There are simply too
many strong units to eliminate
at once. It becomes an
impossible task therefore unless
you try a special plan. And that
is what I have.

Remember that Vulnerary that you
got from the boss last chapter?
Give that to Jagen. Next, move
him all the way up to the fort
on the north island. Think I am
crazy? No, Jagen WILL survive.
Use him to pile some damage on
the thief (with a Javelin)

Next, move Ogma and Bord back a
bit and move Draug to the fort.
End your turn.

Upon the start of your turn,
Jagen will be healed to 13 HP
and Draug will be at 9 or so HP
(after healing). Immediately use
Jagen's Vulnerary then end his
move.

Next, use a combination of all
your units to destroy the four
enemies. It is tough to describe
how to do this, but luck in
hitting definitely plays a role.
Though this is what I recommend
roughly:

Kill the west-most pirate first.
Flood him with Javelins, Iron
Lances, and Iron Swords. Bord
and Cord even can do a healthy
amount in one attack. Barst's
Hand Axe is like another
Javelin.

Next thing to take care of is
the other pirate. Use whatever
units that still have a turn. If
possible, kill both thieves too.

On the enemy turn, the pirate
will abandon Jagen in favor of
attacking whoever killed the
thief. The cavaliers should be
closing in.

Back to your turn, use Jagen's
Javelin to damage the thief from
behind. Defeat him easily after.
Now, retreat all your units from
the lower level upward, note
that the hunter left on the
north island is practically
harmless.

Leave Ogma or someone with a
decent speed/defence on the
plain before the bridge. Even
Draug, even though he will be
doubled, survives barely.

They should attack Ogma or
whoever you put, and you should
either heal or replace that unit
with another (cavaliers work
well). Use Jagen or someone to
finish the hunter on top.

If you see that the cavalier
will die to one hit, kill him
and then forcefully finish the
next cavalier.

If you have made it this far,
good job. This was definitely
the hardest part of this map.
Next thing to do is heal all
your units. Then, take note that
the save point is something we
want (you don't want to repeat
the above again, do you?).

Bring all good units toward the
area, outside the enemy attack
boundary.

Then, proceed with care. Make
sure the unit you put does not
have less than 4 speed in
relation to the pirate on the
bottom-left corner.

Save the game at the map
savepoint and get ready for the
next wave of enemies.

This one is a little trickier
since the recruitable unit is
next to another hunter. You need
to recruit with Shiida, and the
other hunter CAN deal 18 damage,
more than Shiida's max (even
with her 1 HP gain from a level
up)

This of course, is extremely
tricky. Either you risk letting
them charge at you before
recruiting, or you recruit
Castor at the bridge, move units
to block the square Shiida can
be attacked from, and move
Castor to the other.

Castor will unfortunately, die.
I did not plan to use Castor, so
I did not exactly care too much.
If the reader wants to struggle
to keep her alive, you can go
ahead.

After this, the only last part
is the boss. Use lure and kill
tactics to defeat the last few
pirates. Visit the armory and
village eventually and get 5000
gold

You don't need to get anything
from the armory, unless of
course it is like a Hand Axe for
Barst.

Last thing to worry about is the
boss...


--------------------------------
BOSS: Gomer
HP: 32

Weapon: Hand Axe (drops Steel
Sword)

How to beat: This guy is quite
tough. First of all, he has 16
strength. He WILL practically
kill any unit in one hit not
named Ogma, Jagen, or Abel. This
is because he also boasts 11
speed, which means he will
double any unit with less than 8
speed (low-HP units like Shiida
will be knocked out by brute
force).

First, bring all able units
over, even if they will not
partake in the main assault.

The trick is to equip Ogma's
Steel Sword, heal him up, then
leave him next to the boss. DO
NOT ATTACK. Next turn, the boss
will attack and has a 50% chance
of hitting.

We are waiting for one of the
following to happen:

A) Ogma lands a critical (most
likely- he did it for me twice
in five attempts) B) The boss
runs out of Hand Axes (not
likely, but possible)

If Ogma gets hit, run him to the
fort nearby and let him heal.
Move him back next turn.

Once you land a critical, the
boss should be left with a small
amount of HP left. Now, use all
your units in a mad rush to try
and defeat the boss. For me,
Ogma had leveled up strength, so
only one more attack with a
Steel Sword was necessary.

This boss drops a Steel Sword
when dead.
--------------------------------


Congrats if you have killed the
boss, Chapter 2 complete!



-_-_-_-_-
Chapter 3 - A Brush in the Teeth
[HM3]
_-_-_-_-_


Enemies: Boss w/Hand Axe 3
Hunters w/ Iron Bow 2 Thieves w/
Iron Sword (they have 15
speed...) 8 Fighters w/ Steel
Axe (they have 38 HP each...)

Reinforcements: None

Recruitable: Lena/Julian (at
beginning) w/ Warp and Iron
Sword respectively Nabarl w/
Killing Edge


All I can say is good luck with
this level. Everything looks
simple, but I can almost
guarantee you that if you
underestimate the fighters, you
WILL lose a unit or two...or
three...you get the point.

First thing to do is move Lena +
Julian downward. Next, move
Marth + Barst to the west. Marth
is heading to the village to get
the Devil Axe and Barst is going
to use it.

Jagen should give the Vulnerary
from last battle to Barst
(assuming you used my guide for
Chapter 2, if not then it simply
is the one you got from the
Chapter 1 Boss) For the rest of
your units, just position them
on the eastern border.

Use the X button to position
Shiida safely on the mountains
(she is needed to recruit
Nabarl).

On the second turn, move Lena +
Julian all the way down. Trade
Wrys's Heal to Lena for she is
better. Visit the village with
Marth, and trade the Devil Axe
to Barst. Use the X range button
to place ALL units away from
attack in the right side (near
mountain).

Next turn, a whole lot of stuff
will happen. First, use the X
button again to find where Barst
can be placed to ONLY be
attacked by one of the three
fighter.

Equip the Devil Axe for him,
move Marth + Jagen to the east.

Nabarl and two thieves should
have popped up. Use RANGED
Javelin attacks to fight the
thieves first. Recruit Nabarl,
BUT DO NOT ATTACK WITH HIM!
There are three fighters above
that are ready to defeat your
army if you try to do so.

Our goal is to defeat all the
thieves WITHOUT using Nabarl.
The only two units that are fit
for the following job are Ogma
and Nabarl. We want to form a
blockade that will stop the
three fighters while we deal
with the left enemies.

Once you find a way to kill the
thieves, place Nabarl FORWARD
ENOUGH SO THAT THE ENEMIES
CANNOT BYPASS HIM. Picture of
where to place units:

  /
   \ EE /
    |EM|
    |NM|
    |OH|
    |  |
   /  L \
---  F   |


Legend:

--- and / and \ and | = boundari

M = mountain (not passable by
your unit or the enemy) H = Hill
(passable by some of your units
and by the enemy fighters) L =
Lena (healer) F = the fort on
the bottom N = Nabarl O = Ogma
(you need both)


As I hope you can
see/understand, Nabarl much be
far enough to become a true
blockade. Otherwise, the
fighters can bypass the hills
and attack venerable units like
Lena, things won't look
pretty...

The fighters have a chance of
missing Nabarl/Ogma. In that
case, it is good. If they hit,
you will probably have to switch
the unit out for the other one
(Nabarl/Ogma depending on who
got hit). Lena, of course, heals
the hurt unit.

Note that the single most
dangerous thing is to get hit,
then critical counter- attack
the enemy. This will kill the
enemy and allow the next fighter
to hit you, almost a 100% chance
of death.

Keep this system going for the
next few turns until you finish
with the left frontier (then you
can think about wiping out the
remaining survivors)

Back on track to yet the other
danger...actually it deserves
it's own section.


--------------------------------
Our plan to defeat the RUSH.

I must have restarted the
chapter at least ten times due
to the annoyance of the enemy
rush. The idea is to move a unit
to a square where ONLY one enemy
can attack it. Keep retreating
and using Vulneraries to keep
your health up.

At first, I used Jagen + Silver
Lance. This...fails since I can
only kill one unit by
counterattacks by the time the
enemies reach my main army.

I have found however a real
risky way to beat the rush
without killing units.

We left off with Barst and his
Devil Axe about to get attacked.
If you have horrible luck, and
this applies for any time you
use a Devil item, the weapon
will harm your user, in this
case Barst. A 24 damage hit WILL
finish Barst off with no doubt.

You sadly have no way to stop
this, so you must hope for about
three hits that you don't have
to restart the whole chapter
over.

Each hit with the Devil Axe does
24 damage, two blows will defeat
any fighter.

Keep retreating until you
realize that the fighters are
close to attacking other units.
Move them away just enough to
get out of the range of attack.

Bord and Cord become useful
here, they deal 10+ damage with
one blow (though you have to
watch that they don't die
because they only have 20 HP).

If done correctly, here should
be the situation:

(Your Units) Barst (a little
less than max HP with no
Vulneraries left) Cord (Full HP)
Bord (Full HP) Other units -
Jagen, Cain, Marth, Abel, Shiida
(Full HP)

(Enemies)

2 out of the 3 original Fighters
left (Both at Full HP)


At this point, move Cord + Bord
(or Barst again if you trust his
Devil Axe) just into range of
the first of two fighters. Other
two units should be nearby.

After the front fighter eats a
counterattack, IT starts. It's
impossible to hold on any
longer, use everything and
anything in an attempt to kill
the two weakened fighters. All
you actually got to do is kill
the weakened one then make sure
all units in attack range of the
other one can take it.

A good way to do this is to
surround the remaining fighter
with four strong units (Shiida,
Jagen, Cain, Abel/Marth) works.
Note that Abel will get doubled
if he only has 7 speed and he
has the Javelin equipped.

With this, you should defeat the
vigorous left advance. Good luck
BTW.

END OF MINI-SECTION (about Barst
and my plan to stop the left
rush)
--------------------------------


At this point, here is the
rundown of enemies that should
be left:

1 Boss 2 Fighters nearby him 2
Hunters nearby him 1 Hunter in
the mountain area still 1 or 2
Fighters left in the blockaded
area.


Kill the last few fighters then
swoop in to finish the hunter in
the mountain area. He moves when
you get somewhat close.

Oh and use the green save point
if you haven't already.

Next, we pick the two hunters
near the boss. Lure & kill (note
they also start moving before
you get into attack range). Lure
the two fighters (I would bring
your whole army just to be
safe).

You can blockade the fort and
easily defeat the two. It ends
with them having a horrible 37%
hit rate and you having near
100% (using Ogma + Steel Sword).

Last part is the boss...arguably
the HARDEST BOSS IN THE WHOLE
GAME!

--------------------------------
BOSS: Reynard
HP: 41

Weapon: Hand Axe (Drop Mend)

How to beat: With 15 STR and 14
SPD, this guy outclasses almost
anyone in your army. After
fighting that long battle, you
don't want to throw away the
game by losing to this guy, do
you?

While many people advocate using
Ogma + Killing Edge to critical,
I advertise for you to simply do
the following:

(MAJOR CREDIT TO MEKKAH!) Just
sit Ogma and waste his Hand Axes
until he has none left.

After this, he has no way to
attack...so have fun getting EXP
for your units.

NOTE that I would not advise
wasting Lena's Heal on this. Use
the fort instead.

OR you can just follow the Ogma
+ Killing Edge + Critical
strategy because he only had a
44% hit chance on my Ogma (for
only 14 damage -- out of my 26)
--------------------------------


If you got this far, CONGRATS!
You have beaten (arguably) the
hardest three chapters of Hard
Mode 5. Whew...



-_-_-_-_-
Chapter 4 - Battle in the Lea
[HM4]
_-_-_-_-_


Enemies: 4 Fighters w/ Iron Axe
2 Hunters w/ Iron Bow
2 Archers w/ Steel Bow
1 Knight w/ Iron Lance
3 Cavaliers w/ Iron Sword
1 Cavalier w/ Armorslayer
2 Horsemen w/ Iron Bow
1 Curate w/ Heal
2 Thieves w/ Iron Sword
Boss w/ Ridersbane

Reinforcements: None

Recruitable: Matthis w/ Iron
Lance Merric (from village) w/
Excalibur


Before the chapter, make the
sure the following is true:

- Shiida has a Javelin and Barst
- You have 5+ uses of Vulnerarie

I do not recommend reclassing
anyone, but as normal, do as you
see fit. One place of interest
however should be the forge.
Spend as much money as you want
in buffing up a weapon (Killing
Edge is a good idea if it has a
decent amount of uses left)

Next, decide if you want to go
to gaiden chapter 6x. If you do,
bring as many bad units that you
can afford. Go to the map
preparation screen and place
them as far right as possible.
You will see why later.


Starting the chapter...


First thing to note is that
there are two advances: four
fighters and four cavaliers.
Dealing with them without a plan
is a certain one-way road to
disaster. The easiest way to
victory is to setup a blockade.
Taking a quick glance at the
map, the only chokepoint that is
holdable is the bridge.

Spend a few units to kill the
lone thief. As for the rest of
your units, move them toward the
bridge. On the enemy turn, the
four fighters, a hunter, and the
cavaliers should advance.

Defeat the hunter by direct
attacks, then continue your
movement of troops. For the
units you want to kill, scatter
them around randomly.
Preferrably in a corner that
will waste the enemy unit's time
to move/attack them.

Position your units into this
strategic position:



(Thanks to garfuncle for the
idea!)


    |B H|
   F|U U|
  _____|E E|*_____
   E E E E

* = unique water space that can 

B = Barst (or Bord/Cord) H =
Healer S = Flier (Caeda/Shiida)
E = Enemies U = Units that will
be taking the damage for you.
Effectively, the blockade. Give
them the Vulneraries mentioned
beforehand. I recommend Ogma or
Navarre for this job. Even Jagen
works.


Each turn, heal one unit with
Lena. For the other unit, use a
healing item. If an enemy facing
the two blockades gets to low
HP, attempt to kill them with
indirect attacks (from Shiida
and Barst).

If you run out of healing items,
simply replace the blockade with
a different unit. In the midst
of the enemy, you should find
Matthis, whom is the unit able
to be recruited. However, you
easily risk losing units if you
try to recruit with Lena.

For me, I allowed my units to
get experience from killing him.

Note that on the top, a thief
and hunter reside. Defeat them
with excess units (those not
involved in the blockade).

After a few turns of blockading,
you should eventually clear all
the enemies. This is the end of
the hard part. Use the midpoint
save.

Visit the armory for some useful
steel weapons, distribute then
use the forts to heal your
units. When ready, Move all
units west then lure in the
archers with a strong defence
unit (Jagen actually works for
this). Kill them the next turn
with direct attacks (should be
easy if you surround them).

Hopefully, you haven't triggered
the horsemen on top. If you did,
retreat your army back then lure
in one horseman at a time. These
enemies are the first pre-
promoted enemy you face, yet
they are not anything extremely
dangerous.

Their main advantage is their
speed, not strength. One
horseman can probably double
half your units, though each hit
may only deal 8-10 damage. No
unit should die if you only let
one horseman attack your unit in
a turn time span.

I found Marth's rapier to be a
great help here, deals roughly
15 damage.

The last knight left does not
move until you attack him. Go to
the village, get Merric, then
use a high HP/defence unit to
blockade the bridge. Attack with
Merric from behind. The knight
should attack the high/defence
unit instead of Merric. After
barely surviving this attack,
finish the knight off with a
second Excalibur blow.

Round the last enemy curate up,
and visit the village to the
side for 5,000G.

If you plan to try your luck in
the arena now, use the second
map savepoint. You should be
warned; the arena's enemies are
much harder than Normal Mode's
arena enemies.

The boss...doesn't even deserve
his own box...but what the
heck...


--------------------------------
BOSS: Bentheon
HP: 37

Weapon: Ridersbane (drops it)

How to beat: This boss...has
worse stats compared to last
chapter. Plus, he has no
indirect weapon. Merric's level
one base stats can deal 17
damage (with 24% critical)...so
it's no surprise that this boss
gives people little problem.

--------------------------------


Sorry for the wait (for this
section), I just have been busy.
The rest of the chapters will be
here soon...patience is the key.


-_-_-_-_-
Chapter 5 - Champions of Aurelis
[HM5]
_-_-_-_-_


Enemies: 2 Thieves w/ Steel
Sword 2 Pegasus Knights w/ Steel
Lance 4 Archers w/ Steel Bow 2
Knights w/ Steel Lance (one
Knight drops a Door Key) 5
Cavaliers w/ Steel Lance 1
Curate w/ Heal


Reinforcements: Two forts, one
spawns Pegasus Knights (30 HP,
Steel Lance) and the other
spawns a cavalier (Steel Lance
again).

Reinforcements begin when you
cross an imaginary line into the
"northwest" part of map. The
line is a little bit west of the
Mid-Chapter save point.

Reinforcements last about 7-10
turns. Note that I do not have
an exact number since I do not
encourage attempting to kill all
of them.

Recruits: (Wolf/Sedgar/Hardin/Vy
land/Roshea all join at
beginning of chapter) Wendell is
the sage on the northeast
corner. Has Thunder and Barrier.


Before the battle, pick out
unnecessary units (you only get
to choose 10 for this battle).
After, make sure Shiida/Caeda
has her Wing Spear, Merric has
his Excalibur, and that Cain +
Abel have their respective
Steel/Javelin weapons.

Ogma should still have his Steel
Sword.

On the map screen, place Abel +
Cain + Jagen + Ogma toward the
left-most edge.


Start the battle.


First thing to note: In this
battle, it is entirely possible
to save all your units. However,
I would not recommend restarting
for relatively worthless units
like Vyland and Roshea. In fact,
other experts advertise using
them as bait and fodder, though
I believe my method can avoid
all casualities.

You should take note that you
also have control of the left
cavaliers/horsemen from turn 1.
They will be extremely
vulnerable; no one in their
vincinity can heal them. Plus,
they're all weak and WITHOUT A
DOUBT will get wiped out if you
do not stop the enemy advance.

This, logically, requires
Marth's group to divert most of
the attackers. That is why on
the first turn, we send Ogma +
Abel + Cain + Jagen + anyone
else that you can rely on toward
the bridge. Use the X button and
avoid the cavaliers to the
upper-right.

Before you end your turn, keep X
on. Now go to the lower-right
side of the map, near the
bridges. Do you see an indent?
There should be one, seperated
by two red spaces. Send Shiida
with the Wing Spear equipped to
the one on the left.

FOR THE UNITS ON THE LEFT FLANK,
I am not exactly sure if this
works, but I like to move my
units forward, just out of enemy
attack range. Next turn, move
them back and you should have
diverted a few easy-to-kill
archers from Marth's army.

Move the rest of your units
(Merric, Lena, Marth) around
wherever you want (Marth should
most likely stay with Shiida to
eventually recruit Wendell)

On the enemies' turn, most of
them will rush the bridge. Some
will head to the southern path,
toward our weak
horsemen/cavalier group. The
cavaliers on the north-east will
charge Shiida, and one should
die (4+ STR is enough to kill a
cavalier with a Wing Spear +
Shiida).


Back to our turn, swing in
Marth's rapier, Merric's
Excalibur, and any other helper
(maybe Barst's Hand Axe), to
finish the last two cavaliers.

DON'T RUSH ANY FARTHER! IN OTHER
WORDS, DON'T PROVOKE THE PEGASUS
KNIGHT ON TOP

The Pegasus Knight is much
stronger than anything you have
faced yet. With 30 HP, 10 Move,
and a Steel Lance, it may be as
strong as your strongest unit!

Luckily, it isn't aggressive and
won't attack on it's own. That
said, it covers the scope of the
village so it may cause trouble.


Still on turn 2, send one
cavalier upward and sit on the
bridge. After, press X. Re-
adjust to the bridge offensive
attack range, then end your
turn. Move Lena over to the
bridge, but of course, out of
attack range.

On the enemies' turn, they will
simply keep moving toward the
bridge, etc.


For the next turn (3), send a
stout "tank" (high HP/defence)
unit to plug the bridge. I used
Ogma, my strongest unit.

On the right side, the enemies
should not have shifted. If
Wendell, the archer, or the
Pegasus Knight moved, then you
provoked them somehow. If not,
then all is good. Use the X
button feature and place Merric
in the Pegasus Knight's range.

For the units on the left side,
lure in whatever unit is
following you. The idea is to
blockade the small passageway
with a unit, like Hardin, before
you can get help.

On the enemies' turn, they
should whittle your blockade on
the bridge to close to dead.
Thieves should approach the
upper bridge. The Pegasus Knight
should attack Merric...and die
to his powerful 36+ damage (90+
hit rate) attack. The archer and
Wendell should also be aroused.


Back to our turn (4), retreat
with Marth and whatever unit is
accompanying him on the right,
and lure in Wendell (it's easier
to recruit him than kill him)

Retreat your blockade on the
bridge. Replace with another
unit, like Jagen. Lena should
heal the hurt previous blockade.
Remember that if the direct
enemy in front of your blockade
is about to die, killing them on
your turn is a good idea (to
avoid him attacking, dieing,
then being replaced by another
unit).

Now that the Pegasus Knight is
gone, you can move your upper
cavalier/unit to the bridge
entrance. The thieves can't
destroy the village if you do
so.

On the left side, keep
blockading and replace with
Vyland and Roshea if needed.


Basically, all you need to do is
keep this up. There are a
limited amount of units, and
they'll eventually disappate.
Worst case scenario is that you
lose the village...big deal a
Firestone.


Once you get to a point that the
enemies are stationary, you know
that you have complete the first
half of this map. Use one of the
two mid-chapter save points then
listen up...

________________________________
Reinforcements in H5...And this
map's reinforcements.

There is this cheap feature they
added into this game...enemies
will spawn in AND MOVE on the
same turn. This makes spawn
killing off forts NEAR
IMPOSSIBLE.

Back to this chapter, it's
impossible (or it will turn you
literaly crazy) to wait out the
reinforcements. I've tried...and
I can say that it wasn't an
enjoyable time. Here's what
happens (for the curious):


First, the Pegasus Knights on
the upper-left will fly either
south or to the west. Both ways
give headaches. On the south
side, one Pegasus Knight can
defeat your entire brigade of
horsemen/cavaliers. It's
possible to avoid one, but
without a healer, the second one
will finish them off.

Next, cavaliers will spawn in
the other fort. They harass the
bridge blockade and the
reinforcements lasted so long
that they outlived my Mend
staff. Needless to say, they,
along with some Pegasus Knights,
will rip your army to shreds.


So...the only choice is to place
a unit on the fort. That's why I
advocate using Warp to place
units on the forts.
________________________________


Quick summary of above^^, you
can't stand the reinforcements.
You need to use the Warp staff
to get a unit to the forts.
First, send a full-HP Merric to
the upper-right corner. You can
live fighting a few cavaliers,
but Pegasus Knights are too much
trouble.

Note: Merric will kill the
Pegasus Knight that is hovering
around.

After, your blockade should kill
a few cavaliers. After, use
another Warp to plug the other
fort (or get EXP off the
cavaliers if you want first).

The rest is simple. Use Magic on
the knight near the boss, kill
the healer on top. After, boss
time.


--------------------------------
BOSS: Merach
HP: 36

Weapon: Silver Lance (drops it)

How to beat: This boss has a
high STR and can defeat low-HP
units like Marth and
Caeda/Shiida. The best way to
win this is to use Merric's
Excalibur.

If you don't have a magic user
alive, you probably will have to
grind a few levels on
Wolf/Sedgar then kill him fast.

--------------------------------


Yay, chapter 5 done. Save as
always.


CHAPTER 6 WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

***This section was inspired by 

Also note that all information
in here is simply put together
from information on
serenesforest. Credit to them, I
couldn't have figured out the
places myself Also, credit to
AncientArti.

To access a secret shop, you
need a VIP card, first obtained
in Chapter 17 by an enemy bishop
that is sitting on the far
south-west corner.

Simply stepping on a suspicious
square will allow you to enter
the secret shop.

The following are the shops and
what they sell:


[CHAPTER 17]

Right above the throne in the
northeast part of the map, there
is an indent in the wall. Here
is the first one. And here is
what they sell:

(NOTE: You can only buy the
following items below 3 times
before they run out of stock)

a door square that you can stand
on.

(Again, they only have three
stock)

--------------------------------
Master Seal (1) - 2500G
--------------------------------

[CHP24]

In the southwest part of the
map, in a hilly area similar to
Chapter 21. Same blue blur you
are looking for.

(Note: Again, three max buys
only)

				_-_-_-_-_-
 				   FAQ             [5A]
				-_-_-_-_-_



Q: I can't find out how to
promote a unit! Help!

A: The only promoting item in
this game is the Master Seal
(and the Elysian Whip, but don't
worry about that for now). You
get your first one at about
Chapter 10ish. Note: You can buy
more online

Q: What does the online shop
sell? When?

A: See section [1J] for more
info.

Q: I have to sacrifice someone
in the Prologue, who should I?

A: Jagen or one of your least
likeable cavaliers. Some people
sacrifice Gordin, but I say
otherwise.


Q: How do I access the Gaiden
chapters? Are they worth it?

A: To access the Gaiden chapters
in this game, you must have less
than 15 char- acters at the time
when you finish the preceding
chapter. Whether they are wor-
th is a different story. You get
a character from each respective
chapter, so unless you REALLY
want that character OR this is
your first time playing and you
let many characters die OR you
are a perfectionist OR you just
want to try it out...then don't
try to get the Gaidens. (Thanks
to Boojum1)


Q: How do I use ____
Sword/Axe/Lance/Bow? It appears
in grey.

A: Either your character's class
does not support that type of
weapon, or your weapon level is
too low. Fight with that type of
weapon more to level it up.


Q: Do you have a tier list?

A: No, but there are various
other people on, say the forums,
that are willing to compile one.


Q: How can I recruit Minerva in
Chapter 7?

A: You cannot, you must hide in
the back until she leaves in
impatience. You can recruit her
later. Note that as KaKtuZ
added, you may kill her if you
want.


Q: How do I recruit the Manakete
in Chapter 11?

A: You cannot, he is not a
recruitable character.


Q: How do I recruit Camus?

A: You cannot, but you can
recruit the general on the map
with Shiida or Marth.


Q: How do I kill Gharnef?

A: You need Starlight, created
by the two orbs. If you are
fighting him in Chapter 15,
where you first meet him, avoid
contact with him.


Q: How do I recruit Jake? Every
time I get close, he kills
Shiida/Caeda.

A: You can reclass Shiida/Caeda
into a different class then
approach Jake. That or just
waste his ammo with a solid unit
then approach with Shiida/Caeda.


Q: Is it possible to get the
Falchion if I do not kill
Gharnef?

A: Yes, you need to kill off
Tiki also to access Chapter 24x.
You will get a weakened Falchion
there.


Q: Why do people say Sedgar and
Wolf are the best units? They
suck.

A: Their base stats are
