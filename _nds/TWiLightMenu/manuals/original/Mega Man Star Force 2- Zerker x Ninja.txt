Welcome, to my very first walkthrough! This is a complete FAQ/Walkthrough of
the game, Mega Man Star Force 2: Zerker x Ninja/Saurian. It is the sequel to
the first Mega Man Star Force game, and it has many similarities to the
Battle Network games on the GBA. I wrote this walkthrough playing the Saurian
Version, and no Real Brothers or Auto Tribe King were used.

I will constantly be updating this guide, to cover everything in this game.

2. Basic Information                                            [BIN31]
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

====================================
a) Story                     [STR14]
====================================

It's been two months since Mega Man's battle with the FM-ians...

Geo Stelar no longer uses a Transer, and has now upgraded to the Star Carrier,
a new type of mobile terminal. Geo is excited about trying it out, and it is 
at that point that his cohorts in adventure--Prez, Bud, and Zack--drop in on
him.

Prez tells everyone they should make a trip to see the sights and sounds of 
IFL Tower in Wilshire Hills. As Electiopia's largest city, it is the center 
of all that is cool and cutting edge. The group is excited at just the 
thought of going there.

But while Geo and his friends are enjoying their time in Wilshire Hills, 
something terrible and unexpected occurs... A mysteries man appears and throws
the denizens of Wilshire Hills into a panic when he unleashes a horde of 
Viruses!

With the help of his partner in adventure, the alien Omega-Xis, 
Geo Wave Changes into the hero known as Mega Man! The battle with 
a new, terrible enemy is about to begin!

====================================
b) Characters                [CHR41]
====================================

Geo Stelar
----------------
Geo is a kind-hearted 5th grader who loves outer space. After his father 
disappeared in an accident on a space station, Geo became a loner. But other 
kids in Echo Ridge encouraged him to open up, and now he realized the value of
friendship. He is good at fixing machines, just like his father.

Omega-Xis
----------------
An energy being from outer space, Omega-Xis has a strong independent streak. 
His favorite pastime is going "buck wild" on Viruses. He is still living with
Geo.

Luna Platz

Geo's class president. She's bossy, but has a good heart.

Bud Bison

A rough, tough kid who likes to eat. Give him his favorite foods and he can 
do anything.

A know-it-all geek. He has a strong sense of loyalty to Luna.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Turn the game on, cause here we go! Once your at the title screen of the game,
you get to choose which of the two versions you want to play through. Both
Zerker and Ninja/Saurian are separate game files, so it basically is a two 
games in one. Once you have chosen which version you want, you will have to
set up your auto brother, that will come into play later.

Abbervations
--------------
GMW - Green Mystery Wave  - Randomly appears everytime you wave change.
BMW - Blue Mystery Wave   - Appears only once then dissapears.
PMW - Purple Mystery Wave - Requires Unlocker.
ES  - EM Wave Space       - Mega Man can pulse into these objects.

============================================

The game begins with Geo getting his star carrier. It will ask you to input 
a handle which is the name you will go by online. Geo wants to try showing 
someone his personal view, so go talk to the women down by the shop. After
that, the Advert ship that is flying in the sky, will come crashing down.
Talk to everyone around the Advert Ship and the thing will start making all
kinds of noise. This looks like a job for Mega Man! Get to the wavehole and 
pulse in with the R Button.

Welcome to the Wave World! Talk to the Hertz (the blue thing) and learn a few
things from him if you want. Make your way to the Advert Ship and prepare for
the unskipable battle tutorial......wait YOU CAN SKIP THE TUTORIAL!? About
time Capcom! If your not sure how the battle system works in this game, then
I suggest you don't skip it, but if your a veteran from Star Force 1, then by
all means skip it. Its a three consecutive battle against a few Mets.
After the battle, pulse out by returning to the wave hole, or the R button.
Head back to the Advert ship and Geo's friends will appear. Talk to the man,
who is going bonkers over losing money, and then head across the northern
crosswalk to find the propeller, it's above Luna's house. Only way to get it,
is to pulse in and take the wave road. After getting the propeller, pulse out
and return the propeller to the man. He will give you free movie tickets to go
see the movie Ghost Crisis as a reward.

Now that all that is done with, go to your house(The Blue One), and talk to 
your mom. Something is wrong with the TV, so go back outside and pulse in.
Return to your house and inspect the TV, you will then pulse into it.Talk to 
the hertz in here to get the TV to work again. Pulse out and return to your 
mom. When everything is said and done, head to your room and go to sleep. 

The next day, head to the bus stop to meet up with your friends to head to 
Wilshire hills. Before you head out, I suggest you go into all the new 
wave spaces that have opened up and collect all the Blue Mystery Data. 
Before you leave for Wilshire, Luna teaches you about Brotherband and what 
you can do with your Star Carrier.

| Cloaker.......Wave Sign ES               |
| Recover30.....Near Merchant              |
| MadVulcn1.....Wave Road off highway      |
============================================

Once you arrive, I suggest you pulse in and gather the BMW. Once your ready
to continue, head to the elevator to go up to the main area.

============================================

| FireRing1.....Above Shopping Plaza       |

| Recover30.....Air Display ES             |
| 450 Zenny.....Mega Display ES            |
============================================

Talk to everyone and inspect all displays to progress the story. Afterwards, 
you and your friends want to go check out IFL tower since they have time 
before the movie starts. The IFL tower is to the Northeast.

A very mysterious person will appear and talk about the IFL Tower and how
important it is to the people. Inspect the entrance to find out its closed.
Head to the Shopping Plaza in Wilshire Hills, When you get there, Bud tells 
you that he lost his ticket, so now we  have to find his ticket(wonderful). 
Talk to the man in a suit near the elevator to find the ticket, then talk to
the muscular guy standing near you to ask for his Skyboard, but before he will
give it to you, you must talk to a lady for him, shes near the entrance to the
IFL Tower1 area, she wont give you the information that you want, so your 
going to have to pulse in and have Mega go into her star carrier. To do that,
you just have to inspect her while in wave form. Now that you know she likes 
people with High Link power, return to the muscular man and tell him the info 
to get your Skyboard so you can get Buds ticket. Once you give Bud his ticket,
you are finally able to move on.

============================================
|             Shopping Plaza               |
============================================
|                 BMW                      |
--------------------------------------------
| HPMem10.......2nd floor, near elevator   |
| SmEnrgy.......1st floor, near entrance   |
| 550 Zenny.....Security Cam ES            |
============================================

If you have a link power of 50 or more you can receive a HPMem10 from the man 
at the counter. Take the elevator to the second floor, there you will find 
Mr. Boreal, a good friend of Geo's father. Apparently he helped invent the 
Star Carrier, so if you have any questions about it, he's the one to ask. Take
the elevator to the 3rd floor which is the Theatre. The movie will  begin, and
once the intermission begins head back to the lobby so Geo can buy something.
As Geo heads back, he notices that mysterious guy he met at IFL Tower mumbles 
something and heads into the movie theatre. Once the movie begins again the 
power goes out, when the power comes back on, a EM being calling himself Dark 
Phantom, releases a bunch of ghosts viruses and kidnaps Luna and takes her to
the Top of IFL Tower. So head out to the elevator, the power is out on the
elevator, we have to turn the power on, and the switch is on the first floor,
so pulse in and take the wave road down there. Inspect the counter on the
first floor to discover a button that will turn the elevators on. Pulse out 
and head to the first floor. The exit is blocked by 3 ghosts, we need to
become ghostbusters to take em out, so head back to the third floor and talk 
to the first girl at the counter to get the Matter Wave: vacuum, then head 
back down and suck those ghosts up, and head to the IFL Tower.

============================================
|              IFL Tower1                  |
============================================
|                 BMW                      |
--------------------------------------------
| RdrMisil1.....3rd tele pad               |
| HPMem10.......2nd tele pad               |
============================================

Find a wavehole and pulse in and start working your way up to the top. Avoid 
the ghosts at all costs otherwise you will have to battle them, and you won't 
get anything for beating it. So it's a total waste of time. When you get to 
the point where you teleport and theirs another pad next to you, take it and 
head to broken wave area, then head back down a level to get to the scaffold 
where those two guys are. When you get there you will have to fight some 
ghosts, not that difficult. Return to the upper area, since now you can cross 
thanks to the scaffold.

============================================
|              IFL Tower1                  |
============================================
|                 BMW                      |
--------------------------------------------
| Boohat1.......You can't really miss it   |
| LrgEnrgy......Top of IFL Tower           |
============================================

Continue to make your up, and avoid the ghosts as much as possible. It gets a 
little more tricker the higher up you go. Once you get to the top of the 
building itself, you will have more people to help, so battle those ghosts, 
you should be familiar with the way they attack by now. Continue to very very 
top, and make sure you save right before that skull panel, because that means 
your about to fight a boss. It appears that Hyde was Dark Phantom all along 
(who would've guessed?).

==============================================================================
|Boss| Dark Phantom      | HP 500   |  Difficulty: Easy      | Weak: None    |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Stick Sword..........20 damage  - Appears in front of you and slashes you.
                                     (Blockable)
2. Phantom Claw.........30 damage  - Claw appears and attacks the whole row.
                                     (Unblockable)

Dark Phantom isn't that hard, he moves rather slow and his attacks are very 
easy to dodge. You should have no problem beating him, just make use of your 
high attack power chips such as swords and Boohat1. He will occasionally 
teleport to another panel when you move to the row he is in.
==============================================================================

Dark Phantom runs away, Luna gets rescued and you get your first brother! 
Luna gives you 50 Link Power(LP). Link Power allows you to get stronger, the
more brothers you have the higher it goes.

A few weeks later, and Geo is out of school and on his summer vacation. Luna
calls and tells you that you all are going on a vacation and to meet at her
house to discuss plans of where to go (Shes got her boys whipped). But before
that, it appears that your Star Carrier needs to updated, your going to have
to find someone who knows about Star Carrier's. If you haven't already
guessed, the person you need to talk to is, Mr. Boreal, so head to the
shopping plaza 2nd floor.

***Before you head out to the Shopping Plaza, their are five Jobs/quests to 
the people with the pink display above their heads are troubled and are 
looking for help, so pulse in and enter their star carriers to help them and 
in return you get some really nice prizes. Refer to the Jobs/Quests section 
to give you a walkthrough for those quests.***

============================================
Head to Luna's house and you will discuss where you guys will go for your
vacation, and by discuss I mean what Luna decided before you got there. For
your summer vacation your going to a ski resort??? Weird, but OK! Zack says
that their are UMA's (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) in Grizzly Peak, the
ghosts in Wilshire were also UMA's. People have reported a Abominable Snowman,
sounds fun, so why wouldn't a bunch of 5th graders not want to go?

After all that is said and done, you will get an e-mail from Master Shin, who
will tell you a little about Cipher Mail.

Before you head out of Luna's house, go to her computer and download her
wallpaper, and don't forget to get the BMW in Luna's room.

Head on back to your house and talk to your mom to tell her your plans.
She tells you to finish your homework before you go. So head to your computer
to download the homework. Somethings wrong with the waves in the computer, so
pulse in and head into the computer. Their are several viruses inside here,
better take care of them. Pulse out and head back to your room and hit the
sack.

The next day......

You get an e-mail from the Prez telling you to meet at the bus station, so
when you finished all your business around here, head on there.

to talk to the receptionist and check yourself into the hotel.

============================================

Talk to the woman at the counter, and she won't have time for you.....so she
said she will e-mail you when shes not busy. So go around and check the hotel
out. If you take the elevator to the left, the souvenir shop guy will give you
a HPMem10 if you have 100 Link Power or more.  Make your way to the elevator 
to the right.

*Inspect the ski's in the laundry room to get a HPMem10*

Make your way outside to see a familiar face. It's Bob Copper, he works for
the Satella Police. He's here to investigate the Abominable Snowman. Head to
the Foodtopia area next.

Look around and when you talk to the man by the ski lift, you will get an
e-mail. Looks like shes ready to help you, so head back to the Hotel. The
owner of the hotel comes and tells the lady to upgrade their room to the
suite. Nice. Talk turns about the Abominable Snowman, and then a big guy
with a golden tooth and pink clothes comes into the room. His name is Rich
Dotcom. He wants the suite, so he tries to buy it off Geo.

After the conversation head to the elevator to the right, and head to your
room. Luna attempts to open the door, but it won't work, so time to pulse in
and take the wave road into the room. Head outside and pulse in. Head into
the room via the wave road, and then pulse out in the wavehole in the suite.
Open the door to let your friends in.  Your friends want to investigate the 
Abominable Snowman, so time to head out, before you leave, the talking egg
gives you matter wave skis.

*Before you leave the Suite, pulse in and get the BMW, it contains a new
 weapon for Mega.*
 
*Also inspect one of the twin beds in the Suite to get an HPMem10*

Now head to Foodtopia to investigate.

============================================

Head up to the ski lift and you will get a call from a unknown caller telling
you to meet this person at the wave fountain in front of the hotel. So go to
the meeting place.

============================================
|              Grizzly Peak                |
============================================

Once you arrive, no one is their to meet you, but then you hear a scream to
Run and get outta the way. A giant Snowball comes crashing down where Geo was
once standing (Wow, thats a pretty twisted way to kill someone). The person
that warned you about the giant snowball was a young girl named, Amy Gelende,
shes a famous skier that Geo seems to be familiar with. Your friends appear
and are flipping out because apparently their fans of hers, except for Luna,
who gets jealous and PO'ed and storms back to her room. Apparently that giant
snowball is a EM virus, so were going to have to pulse in and delete all three
of them. The locations of the snowballs are:

1. In front of the hotel
2. In front of the ski lift in Foodtopia.
3. Above the slopes in the Foodtopia area.

After you defeat all three of them, you get an e-mail from Zack telling you
to meet up with everyone in the lobby. So pulse out and head there. When you
arrive, you meet a very mysterious person who looks about Geo's age and is
aware of the EM being with Geo, very mysterious indeed. After he leaves, the
owner of the hotel, Amy's father, comes and tells you that they are having a
eating contest in Foodtopia. Bud enters so he can impress Amy for being a....
fatty? Anyway, Geo wants to check on the Prez before he heads out, so head to
the suite. She tells you to get lost, whatever. Head on out and you get a
phone call from Bud asking Geo to get him a EatMchn. Head back into the suite
and ask the talking egg where you can find one. Pulse in and head to the
laundry room, its only accessible via the wave road. Pulse out in the wavehole
and talk to the woman who will give you the EatMchn. Now pulse back in and
head to another wavehole to pulse out. Now that you have the EatMchn, head to
the Foodtopia area.

============================================
|               Foodtopia                  |
============================================

Materialize the EatMchn for Bud and the eating contest will begin. I find this
eating contest very disturbing, especially that EatMchn that is forcing food
down Buds mouth. Bud starts flipping out when the flames appear. Somethings
wrong with Bud, Geo puts on his visualizer and he sees Taurus! He was an 
FM-ian who took control of Buds body in the first game. Bud wave changes into
Taurus Fire and starts going crazy! Time to pulse in and stop him!

==============================================================================
|Boss| Taurus Fire      | HP 600   |  Difficulty: Easy      | Weak: Aqua     |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Ox Tackle............30 damage  - Charges down column. (U)
2. Anger Punch..........25 Damage  - Appears in front and punches. (U)
3. Fire Breath..........20 damage  - Shoots out flames that attack column. (B)
4. Grand Burner.........50 damage  - Smashes ground and lava spews out on the
                                     panels that are highlighted. (B)

If you have played the first Star Force game, then you should be familiar with
Taurus Fire. He has all the same moves, except for one. Since Taurus is fire,
he is weak to aqua cards, but since you have yet to get any aqua cards, you
can't exploit his elemental weakness. Like Dark Phantom, he moves very slow, 
so you should be able to dodge his moves with ease.

When you beat him, you get your first Mega Card.
==============================================================================

After you defeat Taurus, Bud wakes up and doesn't remember a thing. Time to
call it a day, head back to your suite and try to talk to the Prez. She is
still mad, so shes making you sleep on the couch. So hit the sack and save 
your game.

While your sleeping, a scene with Richie and Hyde takes place. Apparently the
snowball accident was their doing. Rich also has a EM being called Yeti.Uh oh,
looks like Richie is able to wave change into Yeti Blizzard! He seems to be
the abominable snowman that everyone has been hearing about.

The next day, everyone was invited to go skiing with Amy, but Luna is still
mad, so she won't be going with you guys. So head to the Foodtopia ski lift.
Once you arrive there, materialize your ski matter waves and head on up to the
top. A scene occurs, after that, ski on down the slopes back to Foodtopia.

When you get to the bottom, a blizzard starts to occur. Bud heads on to the
top to go help Amy. The ski lift was closed down before we could go up, so
were going to have to pulse in to make are way up. Begin to make your ascent.

============================================

Make your way up via the wave road. Once you get to a little purple sphere,
a type of mini game begins. Its a skiing game, you have to help the target
amount of hertz to move on, hitting Trees lowers your HP and if you run into
a snowball, you lose a few hertz that you picked up. Continue on, and you will
eventually come to a second purple sphere. This mini game isn't that hard, so
you shouldn't have any problems. After the second one, you will get a call
from Bud. He found Amy, but shes passed out and he can't get down. He's at the
top of the slopes, so thats where we must head.

============================================

Just keep on trucking to the top, picking up all GMW and BMW along the way. 
Eventually, you will run into yet another purple sphere. This time 50 Hertz
you have to save. Continue on, and you will get to the fourth purple sphere.
Your almost done, just keep heading up. Get the HPMem20 thats right before the
final purple sphere. After that, save right before the skull panel, and get
ready for a fight.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Yeti Blizzard      | HP 700   |  Difficulty: Easy      | Weak: Elec   |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Snowball Fall........30 damage  - He Jumps and when he lands, snowballs
                                     fall on the highlighted panels. (B)
2. Yeti Stomp...........60 Damage  - Jumps off screen and comes crashing down
                                     in front of you. (U)
3. Avalanche............30 damage  - Beats chest, and a waves of snow appear.
                                     (Blockable and Destroyable)

Yeti Blizzard moves allot quicker than the previous EM beings that you have
faced. His attacks are much more frequent, but when you learn his pattern,
he's not that hard. If you have VolticEye1 cards, I suggest you use them
because Yeti Blizzard is weak to electric cards. Also use the Taurus Fire
card to take off an easy 100 damage.
==============================================================================

After you defeat Yeti Blizzard, The blizzard stops and you get a call from
Zack telling you that the Rescue workers are on there way. Bob Copper arrests
Rich Dotcom. After all that you become brothers with Bud and your link power
goes up by an additional 50. The scene switches to Hyde and Lady Vega who are
talking about Rich Dotcom's failure. They also talk about Geo's wave change is
different from theirs. That mysterious kid you met earlier appears, his name
is Solo. They start talking about an OOPArt.

When you arrive in the museum, the Producer guy that gave you those movie
tickets appears and lets Geo and Sonia tour the museum for free. Go to the
receptionist to get the Guide Matter Wave. Materialize the Guide to continue.
On the tour, you learn about the lost continent called Mu. Once you resume
control of Geo, start inspecting all the displays. When you inspect the
Ancient Star carrier, Mega decides to go into it, but when he goes near it,
the alarm triggers. Auto guards appear and try to take you away, but then
the producer comes and Geo apologies and says he accidentally touched an
exhibit. When the tour moves on, you learn about the lost tribes. Once again,
inspect all the displays to move on. When you move on, you learn about the
OOPArt (where have we heard that word from?). Then all of a sudden, black
holes start sucking up all the exhibits. Sonia convinces you to help, so go
and pulse in.

Geo and Sonia wave change, and notice a eyeball type thing. We must destroy
it. To get over there, inspect the wall where the Ninja exhibit is and it
will reveal a hidden passage. Make your way down, and all of a sudden a
blackhole will appear below you. Push the button that appears before it's to
late. If you fail to do it, you will be sucked into the Un-Dimension, with
all the other stuff that was sucked up. The exit randomly changes, so look
around for it and continue and try not to go in the black hole again. Once
you get to the eyeball, it teleports to the OOPArt and beings to suck it up.
Get to OOPArt, fastest way to do it is to pulse out, and pulse back in. Mega
grabs the OOPArt with his mouth and attempts to pull it out. Sonia destroys
the eyeball, and Mega swallows the OOPArt!? Sonia notices something weird,
happened to Mega Man. After all that, Sonia becomes your brother, and you get
an additional 50 Link Power and she gives a extra folder that you can edit.
As you head out, you will notice Bob Copper, talk to him and then you get an
e-mail from a Hertz who is asking for help. Sigh*, head over to Wilshire.

Pulse in and head to the wave road in front of the shopping plaza. If you 
haven't got the BMW behind the Link Power door, now is your chance. Head up
the ramp to the top of the shopping plaza building and talk to the hertz with
the helmet looking thing on his head. Apparently this guy is, uhhhh, Hot......
because he saw Geo and Sonia on a date....(ok,wierd?). He wants you to find
"ColdBody". You can find it in the Old Binoculars EM wave space at the IFL
Tower. Make sure to pulse out.

Once here, inspect the binoculars on the bench and then pulse in at a
wavehole, and then pulse into the binoculars. Talk to the merchant hertz in
here and will give you the "ColdBody". Head back to the hertz and give him
his "ColdBody". Pulse out and head on home and go to sleep.

============================================

During the night Geo and Mega have a nightmare or something. Mega seems to be
hurting from the OOPArt he swallowed. Meanwhile, Hyde and Lady Vega discuss
the OOPArt and a little about Solo.

Once again Geo is watching the news and they talk about the hero Mega Man.
Everyone is meeting at the park so your friends can all hang out with each
other. When your arrive there, you see Solo talking to Ken about the blue
hero. Solo leaves and then your friends arrive. Your friends are all having
a good time until black holes start sucking up people. Time for you to pulse
in and save the day. You have to destroy all three of those Eye ball things.
But before you make your way over there, the OOPArt begins talking to you.
Once you regain control, those black holes will try to suck you up again, so
input the buttons that pop up, otherwise it's the Un-Dimension for you. Once
you destroy the three eye's, a scene occurs.

Everyone is free of the black holes thanks to you, but before you can
celebrate, a giant black hole appears above you and it shoots and then
Solo appears. Then, Solo Wave Changes into Rogue, he doesn't need a EM being
to Wave Change. Then a Eye ball appears and a Black Hole begins to swallow
your friends. Geo is getting he's butt kicked and his friends have gone
under the black hole....things don't look to good right now. Then the OOPArt
seems to give Mega Man some sort of hidden strength and the battle begins....

==============================================================================
|Boss| Rogue              | HP 800   |  Difficulty: Hard      | Weak: None   |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. 3-Hit Combo..........50 damage  - He appears in front of you and hits you
                                     three times. (B)
2. 5-Hit Combo..........80 damage  - He appears in front of you and hits you
                                     five times. (B)
2. Shockwave............30 damage  - Shoots two shockwaves down
                                     two columns. (B)
3. Rogue Fist...........50 damage  - He goes to the back row and shoots out a
                                     barrage of purple fists. (B)
									 
Rogue is probably one of the hardest bosses in the game. This is just his
standard version, he gets much stronger. He has no elemental weakness, he 
moves very fast, and hes attacks come quick giving you very little time to
react. Bring in some of your strongest chips. Paralyze him and then hit him
with a sword card works great. Just keep moving between panels and guard as
much as you can.
==============================================================================

After the battle, Rogue is getting ready to battle again, but Lady Vega's
voice convinces him to retreat for now. Geo attempts to save everybody from
the black hole before it closes, but he only manages to rescue Luna.

The next day, Geo is back to being emo(like in the first game) and gets a call
from the Prez to come to her place. But before you can head to Luna's house,
you have to help this man with the security dog house. Pulse into it, and talk
to the hertz. He wants a D.Enrgy, give him one to continue on. Pulse out and
return to the repair man. Head on to Luna's house. After Geo has he's emo
moment, head back to your house. Talk to your Mom, then head to your room and
a scene occurs. Then Geo has a dream, the OOPArt is once again talking to him.
Wanting to take over his body. 

The next morning, the Prez calls you and tells you that shes coming over. So
Geo better get outta there fast. Before you leave your house, talk to your
mom. She tries and makes Geo feel better. Meanwhile...Luna is heading over
to your house and Hyde kidnaps her yet again. Geo gets a call from Hyde, he 
tells you to head to the movie theatre. Sounds like a trap.

============================================
|              Movie Theatre               |
============================================

Pulse in when you arrive in Wilshire Hills, then head on over to the shopping
plaza. Make your way up to the movie theatre. When you get there, you will
find Dark Phantom on top of the haunted house with an unconscious Luna. He 
summons some weird looking viruses. Make your way to his location and battle
all the solders along the way. Save your game and prepare for a fight. Looks
like the FM-ian Ophiuca is going to take over Luna's body again. Luna Wave
Changes into Queen Ophiuca.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Queen Ophiuca      | HP 1000  |  Difficulty: Medium      | Weak: Fire |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Snake Legion........35 damage  - Summons snakes to attack every column(B)
2. Gorgon Eye..........35 damage  - Shoots laser, causes stun.(B)
3. Serpent Tackle......60 damage  - Charges down two columns.(U)

She isn't to difficult, but her Snake Barrage can be hard dodge, since she
constantly uses it. Her other moves aren't that hard to dodge. Use Fire cards,
such as FireRing2 or HeatUpper1. Taurus Fire will do 200 damage.

You get the Queen Ophiuca Mega Card for beating her.
==============================================================================

After the battle, Luna awakes and is back to normal. Geo was hurt badly 
during the fight and he is really tired. Hyde sends in more viruses. Geo
musters up the strength to fight them, but fails. The OOPArt gives Geo
strength and he defeats those viruses in a blink of an eye. He isn't himself
though, he begins to attack the Prez. The OOPArt is controlling him. The Prez
helps Geo control the OOPArt. You now have the ability to transform into your
Tribe! Time for a series of battles, but this time in your tribe form! Your
Link Power with Prez has now gone up even more.

The next day.....

Head over to Prez house to discuss where to look for your friends. While 
watching the TV, you see Zack on a channel in Loch Mess. Geo doesn't know
where Loch Ness is, so we have to go ask Ken Suthers of the Big Wave shop.
Talk to him and he doesn't tell you anything important. You get an e-mail from
anonymous, telling you to meet in the lobby of the Peak Hotel.

============================================

When you get to the lobby, go right and talk to the person by the waterfall.
It's your Auto-Brother, the person you set up before you started the game.
S/he tells you that Loch Mess is in Netopia. You get to become Brothers with
s/he. You will now be able to double tribe. Head back to Echo Ridge and talk
to Luna.

============================================
|              Echo Ridge                  |
============================================

Luna is going to fly to Loch Ness, Geo is going to take the satellite above
Luna's house to Loch Mess. Well for now, just go to sleep and you leave
tomorrow.

Time to head out, Pulse in and head to the top of Luna's house via the wave
road. Inspect it and then head on out on the Sky Wave road.

============================================

Talk to the hertz up ahead and he will tell you where Loch Mess is. When
the road breaks off into two directions, go right. The virus encounter rate
is really high here, so prepare to be annoyed. Go down and you will find a
Purple Mystery Wave(PMW), if you have an unlocker, you will be able to unlock
it. It contains a Weapon for Mega, BublFist. Keep going down and you will run
into a hertz who will give you something if you have a high link power. Head
back up and continue going north and you will come to the Mess Village SW.

Welcome to another country, you auto pulse out and then Luna shows up.
Apparently, you can't understand the language here, so your going to have to
find someone who understands you. Head up and over the bridge and talk to 
the guy who is dressed weird. The guy is a total jerk, he gives you a 
translator and he films it so he looks like a really nice guy. 

Now that your back in control, start talking to everybody. You will come
across Mr. Copper again (stalker). He's here investigating Messie this time.
After you talk to everybody head to the observation deck. Luna is scared to
cross it because she hears a buzzing sound. Pulse in and check it out. Talk to
the big pink hertz. It seems he is in a dilly of a pickle (ha ha). He needs a
ability from another hertz, he's in the center of Mess Village. Head down, and
take the wave road near the house, it leads to a small island in the center, 
must be it. Talk to the gold hertz and he will give you the ability. Head back
and give it to the pink hertz on the bridge. Pulse out and head back to the
Prez and make your way to the Observation Deck.

============================================
|            Observation Deck              |
============================================

Talk to the guy looking at the water and inspect the binoculars to reveal an
EM wave space. Then head up the elevator and talk to everybody.

*Inspect the binoculars to the north to receive a HPMem10.*

After you talk to everybody, head back to the village. Romero is shooting a
show, when all of a sudden Zack appears! After the show ends, go talk to
Zack. He doesn't want to leave. Talk to the Prez, then head in the direction
Zack went.

============================================

Make your way to Zack, on the way inspect one of the sheep to reveal a EM
wave space.

*Inspect the pink sheep by the water to receive a HPMem10.*

*Wave Change and inspect the waterfall to get the Mega Weapon: ZphyrWng*

Talk to Zack and he still refuses to leave, so head back to the Prez.

Then a scene with Zack occurs. He saw Mr. Romero....he now realizes that
the Messie that he saw was just a fake that Mr. Romero made for ratings. He
traps Zack into the submarine. Then Hyde appears and gives Mr. Romero a
Ancient Star Carrier with an EM being. He then wave changes into Plesio Surf!

A Tsunami is coming, run to the Observation deck. The whole Mess Village is
underwater. Zack calls and tells you he is at the bottom of the Loch. We need
to save him, but to do that we need to get the DiveMch Matter Wave. Talk to
the man with the matter wave and will give you it. Pulse in and head down to
the bottom of the loch.

============================================

In this area, you have to find the buried hertz's in the ground to move on to
the next area. You are giving clues to the locations, find them and dig them
up. The are pretty easy if you use the clues. On another note, if you are 
using the Saurian Tribe-On, I suggest you switch it off, because most of the
enemies are aqua viruses. If you have the Zerker form, then battles will be
even easier for you.

Page 1:
"ONE SLEEPS AT THAT WHICH CARRIES PEOPLE BEYOND THE TWO DARKNESSES..."
Location: Dig in front of the sunken raft.

*There are several mystery waves in the ground you can dig up, perhaps I will
 add a section for it at a later time.

Head over to the next area.

This time it's far more tricker. Hopefully this will help you.

Page 4:
"ONE SLEEPS AT THE OLD SHINY, BLUE BOX OF AIR."
Location: Dig in front of the submarine.

Page 5:
"ONE SLEEPS IN THE DARKNESS BENEATH SOMETHING WHICH IS RED."
Location: Dig in the cave that you can't go in, near the red octopus.

Page 6:
"ONE SLEEPS AT THE PLACE OVERLOOKING THAT WHICH IS NEITHER MAN NOR FISH."
Location: Edge of the cliff looking over the hertz. The cliff that the mermaid
          is looking toward. Nope it isn't the mermaid it was referring to,
          tricky eh?

Page 7:
"ONE SLEEPS AT THE PLACE WHICH IS SURROUNDED BY FIVE STONES."
Location: Dig in the center of the five stones. Not to hard to find.

Page 8:
"ONE SLEEPS WHERE THE KING WHO IS NO MORE SHOULD BE..."
Location: Dig next to the overturned chair, not the obvious one, but the one
          slightly hidden. Take the narrow path to get there.
		  
After you found them all, proceed toward the door and save your game, because
I'm sure you know whats about to go down.

Attacks:
1. Thunder Breath.......45 damage  - Shoots electricity out of his mouth and
                                     it will paralyze you. (B)
2. Aqua Fang............45 damage  - Appears in your area and bites on two
                                     panels. (U)
3. Tidal Wave...........80 damage  - Sends a giant wave toward you, damage
                                     the whole area. If there are rocks, those
                                     will be pushed back and will hit you. (B)
                                     
Plesio Surf is weak to electricity. The two works you will have to work
around, unfortunately, one of them moves. He constantly moves from row to row.
He isn't that difficult, but actually getting a hit in can be hard.
==============================================================================

After the battle, Geo rescues Zack and you become brothers with him and your
Link Power goes up by 50.

Talk to everybody to continue. Head back to the village and the villagers
start to pray to a person named Budicus. Yup, thats Bud. Attempt to talk
to him and he ignores you. Head back to the Whazzap Lines to come up with a
plan. The plan is to make Buds favorite meal, Ginger Beef. We need to find
all the ingredients.

1.Beef   - Inspect the giant piece of meet behind the Shaman.
2.Onion  - Inspect the plants to the south of where the giant statue is.
3.Rice   - Talk to the lady in purple and she will give it to you.
4.Egg    - Pulse in at the Whazzap Lines, head north and take the wave road
           to the right and you will come across a birds nest, inspect it.

*Inspect the sandwich fossil on the wall to get the Mega Weapon, ZenyFndr.

Return to the Prez when you have all the ingredients. Use the CookMchn 
matter wave to make the Ginger Beef. Then watch the plan in action.

The next morning....talk to Luna and then head toward the village.
Uh oh....Solo appears, and he doesn't seem any happier. Pulse in and save Bud.

He hasn't changed at all from the first time you fought him. Even his HP is
the same amount. This time you know his patterns, you have stronger chips and
you have more HP. You should find this fight very easy.
==============================================================================

After the fight, Hollow takes Solo back to Lady Vega and Bud is unconscious.
Head back to the village when you get control again. Your Link Power with
Bud will increase once he wakes up. 

Pulse in and head toward the Shaman. After the scene pulse out and talk to
Luna. Head back to the Whazzap Lines and inspect the tent. After that pulse
in and head back to Echo Ridge via the Sky Wave.

Meanwhile....Hyde appears before the Shaman and entrusts him with an ancient
star carrier containing the EM-Being Condor. He EM Wave changes into Terra
Condor.

Once you regain control of Geo, make your way toward Echo Ridge. When you 
arrive at Echo Ridge SW, you get a phone call from Bud who says they were 
kidnapped by a giant bird and were taking back to the village. Now before
you start making your way back toward Whazzap, talk to the Train person,
and tell him yes and he gives you the Whazzap Key which is a shorty cut to 
Whazzap from Echo Ridge. Head back to the entrance of Echo Ridge SW and 
unlock that locked door and take the shortcut and head back to Whazzap.

When you arrive in the area, the flame hertz will tell you that your going to
have to rescue the other flame hertz and return them to there pedestals. But
beware of the bird in the sky. When you rescue a hertz and are taking him to
his pedestal, the bird will come swooping down and take the hertz back to
where you found him. To prevent that, run into the ruins when he comes down.

The first flame herts is in the upper left area. Take him to the bottom right
pedestal.

The second flame herts is to the right of the entrance. Take him to top left
pedestal.

The third flame hertz is right below the second one. Take him to the top right

Another one is just to the east of the the third sets pedestals. The last one
is on the wave road ramp near the barrier. Take all three of them to the top

Then make your way toward the skull panel, save your game, and prepare for
a fight.

But before the fight, listen to Terra Condors Americanized translation. He is
going to tickle Luna and company forever.......yeah most likely in the
Japanese version, he was going to sacrifice them to the gods of Mu. Well, it's
pretty funny though. :)

3. Flying Impact.........100 damage - Unblockable

After the battle, the Shaman returns to normal and apologizes, all is good.

Geo has a nightmare about Sonia and he is really worried about her. Bud calls
and tells you that he thinks he knows where Sonia is. Head over to Buds place

emergency landing. The pilot is in Loch Mess, so had over there via the Sky
Wave.

You will find the pilot in Messie's Cove, you can't miss him. He has proof
of seeing the girl in pink, but it's in a blackbox at the bottom of the loch.
Time to dive into the loch, head to the observation deck and use the divemch
matter wave. You will run into Mr. Copper yet again on your way. When your
underwater, head to Loch Mess2 and go to were the candle holder, torchere is,
and you will find the blackbox next to it. Pulse out and head back to the
pilot.

Sigh*, he now needs a projector to play the tape. Head back to the TV News Van
to find a guy with a camera. talk to him for the projector. Return to the 
Pilot once more. Materialize it and you will see a quick glimpse of Harp Note.
The pilot says that the picture was taken in the Bermuda Maze. Pulse in and
take the Sky Way.

============================================
|                Sky Wave                  |
============================================

Head toward the wavehole to Whazzap. When you come to the point where you
usually head up, don't. Go right till you come to a locked gate. Talk to the
hertz and he will tell you that the door is broken. Inspect the door to head
into the Bermuda Maze.

============================================
|              Bermuda Maze                |
============================================

Right when you enter, you will see Harp Note. She is obviously not herself.
She cuts her brotherband with you and then attacks you and knocks you out
telling you to leave her alone. She appears to be working for Lady Vega.

============================================
|              Echo Ridge                  |
============================================

Geo is back in he's house and is pretty depressed yet again. He gets a email
from the Prez and decides to bail on her again. When you get control, head 
to the bus stop and Geo will automatically go to Wilshire Hills. 

============================================
|             Wilshire Hills               |
============================================

Go up the elevator and head up the ramp and inspect the Sonia air display for
a flashback sequence to occur. Geo starts to talk about his feelings when the
ground starts to shake and the one called Hollow magically appears and he
summons a bunch of viruses to attack the people. Pulse in and help all five
people. The viruses aren't that difficult. After you defeat them all, Hollow
introduces himself to you, and then Solo appears and wave changes. Time for a
battle!

==============================================================================
|Boss| Rogue EX           | HP 1200  |  Difficulty: Impossible| Weak: None   |
==============================================================================
This fight can't be one. You won't even be able to touch him with any attacks.
Just attack him and dodge as much as you can until the battle ends.
==============================================================================

Right when Solo was going to finish you off, you magically disappear. Sonia
rescues you. She still won't come back with you, she says she is working for
Lady Vega and will obey Hollows orders.

============================================
|              Echo Ridge                  |
============================================

Head back into your house and go to sleep. During the night, a scene with
Sonia and Hollow occurs. It sheds some light on her reasons for joining them.
Geo has a dream of Sonia and then he wakes up. Geo wants to leave before the
Prez can come, so head outside and make a run for it. Awwww, they ambushed
you before you could leave. Geo tells them everything, even Sonia being
able to wave change into Harp Note.

After the conservation, Geo is once again happy. So pulse in an head back to 
the Bermuda Maze and meet up with Sonia.

============================================
|              Bermuda Maze                |
============================================

Right when you enter, you will once again be greeted by Sonia. She will
continue to state that she is your enemy. Geo trusts her and then you fight.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Harp Note        | HP 1400  |  Difficulty: Easy        | Weak: None   |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Shock Note          -  70 Damage, (Blockable)
2. Machine Gun String  -  60 Damage, also paralyzes you. (Unblockable)
3. Pulse Song          - 100 Damage, also causes random status effect.(B)

If you have played the first Star Force game, then you should be familiar with
all of Harp Notes attacks. She really isn't that hard, all of her attacks are
easy to dodge.
==============================================================================

After the battle, Sonia explains her situation and apologizes. You become
brothers with Sonia again, but this time the link power is much higher. Now
that you and Sonia are friends again, head deeper into the Bermuda Maze.

For the next part your going to have to follow a little guy for the correct
path. If you go down the wrong path, you have to fight a virus battle. You
could just follow him, or I can tell where to go....

-------------
|  BMW      |
-------------
|Reflect/280|
|SlvMeteor  |
-------------

The room's are just like a giant X, so think of the leg's of the X when I say
turn top left or bottom left.

1.Take the bottom left path.
2.Take the top left path.
3.Take the top left path.
4.Take the top left path
5.Take the top right path.
6.Take the bottom right path.
7.Take the bottom right path.
8.Take the top right path.

You will now be in an area with multi colored stars in the sky. Use the Sky
screen to know which colored Hertz are telling the truth, though I will just
tell you what path to take.

1.Take the top left.
2.Take the top right.
3.Take the top left.
4.Take the bottom left.
5.Take the bottom left.

Now you should arrive in the final maze section.

1.Take the bottom left.
2.Take the top left.
3.Take the bottom left.
4.Take the top left.
5.Take the top right.

And now a scene will occur. Then your back in control, take the top left path
and save before you go in. Head up the road and another scene will begin.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Hollow           | HP 1600  |  Difficulty: Hard        | Weak: Wood   |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Thunder Bazooka  - 80  Damage  - Blockable
2. Thunder Rain     - 120 Damage  - Blockable

Throughout the entire fight, Hollow will be summoning different viruses on 
those strange looking panels. The Queen Ophuicus card works wonders for this
fight, because not only will it replace 2 columns of those summoning panels,
but turn them into poison panels. Hollow is a pretty hard fight.
==============================================================================

Hollow takes he's leave your rival Solo appears. Sonia sends you flying
because she doesn't want you to get hurt, so she takes on Solo by herself.
Save your game and make your way back there. Solo beat Harp Note up. Solo
tells us a little bit of he's back story and why he hates Link Power.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Rogue EX           | HP 1200  |  Difficulty: Hard      | Weak: None   |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. 3-hit combo     - 90 Damage  - Blockable
2. 5-hit Combo     -120 Damage  - Blockable
3. Shockwave       - 60 Damage  - Blockable
4. Rogue Fist      - 80 Damage  - Blockable

When he loses half his HP he pulls out a sword and he does several sword
combos. He becomes very difficult at this point. Also he has a barrier that
will randomly cancel out attacks when you hit him. Not much I can say will
help your fight, just learn his attack pattern and use strong cards.
==============================================================================

After you defeat Solo, everyone pases out and Hyde comes along and takes the
OOPArt from Geo.

 H) Chapter 8: The Continent of Mu                              [MU101]
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

A few days later....

============================================
|              Echo Ridge                  |
============================================

Geo wakes up and finds out Sonia is in the hospital and is in critical
condition. Bud and Zack call and tell you to watch the TV. Head to your
living room TV to find that Lady Vega is revealing her plans to the whole
planet. You learn that even without the OOPArt, you can still Tribe-On.
Now head to the Bermuda Maze.

============================================
|              Bermuda Maze                |
============================================

Right when you walk up you will run into Dark Phantom and he will suck you 
into a blackhole where you will have to fight a series of virus battles.
After the battles, find the exit outta the Un-Dimension. Once your out,
you will be in Wilshire Hills. Then, the continent of Mu rises from the
water and is floats in the sky. It soon disappears and were going to have
to wait till tomorrow to go to Mu. So head back home and hit the sack.

============================================
|              Echo Ridge                  |
============================================

The next day.....

Geo gets a call from Zack and he tells you a little about Vega. Head outside
to find Mu back in the sky. Vega sends down thousands of EM Beings. Pulse in
and go help those people. When you attempt to help them, the people start
acting funny and actually wanting to join the Neo Mu Empire. Inspect one of
their star carriers to reveal that they lost all their link power. Luna calls
you and tells you to come over to her place. Pulse out and make your way over.
Everyone says goodbye and wish Geo luck. After that head to Mu! Just head to
the Bermuda Maze to get there.

============================================
|              Bermuda Maze                |
============================================

Talk to the merchant at the entrance and buy as many HPMem20 from him as you
can, because your going to be needing a lot of HP for the final fight. Talk
to the guy at the exit to the next area to learn the paths you must take to
get to Mu.

When you go to the next area, the guy will say Mu is to the right, so go that
way.

Remember to think of an X with these directions. UP left would be the top left
leg of the X, so just remember X.

1.Take the top right path.
2.Take the bottom right path.
3.Take the bottom left path.
4.Take the top right path.
5.Take the top left path.

Now just follow the path till you come to Mu. Also make sure to buy plenty
of D.Enrgy from the merchant at the end, because you will probably need them.
Sadly he charges you 200 Zenny more than the normal cost of a D.Enrgy.

============================================
|             Sky Staircase                |
============================================
*save before you head up.
When you go up the staircase, you will run into Hyde.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Dark Phantom EX   | HP 1500  |  Difficulty: Easy      | Weak: None    |
==============================================================================
Attacks:
1. Stick Sword    -  80 Damage - Blockable
2. Phantom Claw   - 120 Damage - Unblockable
3. Phantom Slash  - 115 Damage - Blockable

He is no different from before, only that he has a new attack which all you
have to do is block.
==============================================================================

Lady Vega gives Hyde even more power after we just beat him...not good. Then
Solo appears and beats Dark Phantom up then Hollow appears and says they no
longer need him and knock him out. Once you regain control, head into Mu.

============================================
|                   Mu                     |

| HP+400    - Right side wave road.        |
| D.Enrgy   - Priest Statue ES,after Yeti.B|
============================================

Head up the stairs and inspect the stone in between the two hertz's to get a
piece of the puzzle. Head up to the top to come to a barrier, inspect it. We
need to find 4 tablets. We already have one, so take the wave roads on both
sides and find the remaining three. Avoid the sword viruses, otherwise you
will have to fight them, unless you input the correct lines in before three
seconds. There are two tablets on the left side, and one on the right side.
Once you gotten all four of the tablets, put the them in order....or I could
just tell you the order.

Kath - "There was a tribe of people with the power to see EM waves... The Mu.

Fon  - "That special power of Mu was the object of fear from other peoples of
        the world, who sought to drive them out."
		
Wir  - "Their search led them to Earth's End. And there they found the Great
        Being, the source of all EM waves."
		
Mir  - "The Mu people got their power to manipulate EM waves from the Great
        Being..."
		
Now that you know the order, you can draw the symbols on the tablets. Then
head on to the next area. A yeti EM body prevents you from going up. He then
wave changes and you have to fight Yeti BlizzardEX. Beat him and continue on.

============================================

Once again your going to have to get 4 stone tablets to continue on.

Tuk  - "The Great Being first gave the Mu language."

Zul  - "The Mu used language to control EM waves and created a prosperous
        civilization."
		
Ebesh- "The Mu technology for Materializing EM waves allowed their
        civilization to advance. And for a time lived in peace..."
		
Masa - "One day Invaders appeared in the Mu's land, Earth's End, and tried to
        drive out the people of Mu."
		
Write down the symbols if you must, input them in that order. Once you do you
will have to fight Plesio SurfEX.

============================================

When you enter, a short scene will come up and then your back in control.
Once again, find the four tablets and return to the barrier and input the
symbols in the correct order.

Foh  - "After the appearance of the invaders, the Mu were divided into those
        who embraced war and those who rejected it."
		
Fai  - "Humans who rejected war,forsook their land and scattered across the
        Earth...And those who embraced war, used the power of EM waves to
        raise their land into the sky."
		
Rai  - "Those Mu who left Earth used EM warriors to wipe out the Invaders."

Chan - "The Mu in the sky conquered all of the peoples on the ground and ruled
        the Earth..."
		
Input the final four symbols and you will have to fight Terra CondorEX.

*Inspect the Ancient Star Carrier after the fight to get a HPMem10.

Now for the Secret Area.....

When you return to your game, pulse out of Mu, and you will get a e-mail from
a mysterious person. The e-mail tells you to come to Lady Vega's Hideout for a
present. You will find Lady Vega's hideout where you first fought Hollow in 
the Bermuda Maze.

Head there and you will find a wave hole, take it and you will be transported 
into Vega's Hideout. Inspect the sphere to get the AltFutre item. Then inspect
the bamboo blinds that Vega always was in to get a ChrgPsn/220. Then inspect
the monitor on the left side to get a IndFrag4. After that pulse out. Then
pulse back in and head to the Satellite Dish for a wave hole to appear in
Echo Ridge ER. Head in there and it will take you to the secret area of the
game, which is an alternate future. Save your game before you enter.

Now that you broken all seven seals, you can now access the wave hole in the
center of the area, but before you go, make sure to unlock those gates with
BMW in them.

Once you take the wave hole, your going to notice a new boss, make sure you
save before you approach him.

==============================================================================
|Boss| General Auriga   | HP 1800  |  Difficulty: Easy          | Weak: None |
==============================================================================
With all the battles that you have been through to get to this point, this guy
shouldn't be much trouble. He is really slow but he's attacks take quite a bit
of your HP down. He may be intimidating when you first see him, but he is a
really easy.
==============================================================================

After you defeat him, head back to find a gate which will open now that you
have defeated General Auriga. Then head on to the next area.

==============================================================================

This area is the final secret area and it is very big. There are many BMW that
you probably won't have access to yet. You will have to fight the remaining IF
versions of the bosses.

Every time you come to a skull panel, save, because your going to fight a IF
version boss. The first one you will face will be KungFooKidIF with 3000 HP
and he moves VERY fast. After you beat him, move on and you will come to a
seal which requires you to have at least 100 different standard class cards.
If you don't have that many, I suggest you go to the Battle Card Locations
section and start gathering them.

Continue on and you will come to a second skull panel, save and you will have
to fight HollowIF with 2800 HP. He is rather difficult.

After you defeat him you will come to a seal which requires you to have ALL of
the standard class cards. Refer to the Battle Card Locations section and get
them all in order to continue.

Now that you have collected all the Standard Class Cards, you will be able to
face Apollo Flame. Make your way up the path and save before the skull panels.

==============================================================================
|Boss| Apollo Flame   | HP 2400  |  Difficulty: Medium          | Weak: Aqua |
==============================================================================
Apollo Flame as you might of guessed, is a Fire enemy, so remember to make use
of his weakness. Before you can damage him, you must destroy his fire barrier,
which only takes a few shots from your blaster, but it regenerates a few 
seconds after destroying it. If you have real life brothers, then this fight
won't be any trouble, but if you are on your own and no Tribe King, then it
will be a much harder fight for you. CancerBubbleSP is a good card to use,
followed by a hard hitting electric chip will do quite a bit of damage. If
your using Wood Ninja, bad idea. Also try not to Double Tribe to ninja, 
cause that will cancel out your tribe-on. Just remember water is your friend.
==============================================================================

After you defeat Apollo Flame, he mentions gathering the six badges. For
beating him, you get the Tribe Badge. The six badges are icons you will see
on the Title Screen of the version you are playing.  The six badges are:

1. MegaMan Badge  - Complete the main story.
2. Tribe Badge    - Defeat Apollo Flame.
3. S Comp Badge   - Collect all the Standard Class Cards.
4. M Comp Badge   - Collect all the Mega Class Cards.
5. G Comp Badge   - Collect all the Giga Class Cards.
6. Mu Badge       - Defeat Le Mu Xa

Once you collect the first five you can fight Le Mu Xa which is a buffed up
version of Le Mu. After you defeat him and boot up your game again, you will
get an e-mail from Solo telling you to raise your link power with your four
in game brothers, which you can do by doing their Jobs/Quests. Once you have
done that, defeat Le Mu Xa and watch the credits, but instead of Solo taking
you back to Echo Ridge, you will be at the Whazzap Ruins and you will have to 
fight RogueSX, the hardest boss in the game. Once you defeat him you get a
screen with all the main characters and it saying Congratulations!

Once you have done all of that, you have truly finished the game. Now the only
thing for you to do is compete in WiFi matches and create awesome battle card
folders.

Congratulations! You have completed Mega Man Star Force 2! Now play the other
version on your game!

11. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)                            [FAQ19]
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q: How much Link Power do I currently give?

   You give Link Power not based on how much you have, but where you are
   currently at in the game:
   Just Started Game            - You give 30 Link Power
   After Dark Phantom Scenario  - You give 40 Link Power
   After Yeti Blizzard Scenario - You give 50 Link Power
   After you get Tribe-On       - You give 60 Link Power 
   After Plesio Surf Scenario   - You give 70 Link Power
   After Terra Condor Scenario  - You give 80 Link Power
   After Bermuda Maze Scenario  - You give 90 Link Power
   After you defeat Le Mu       - You give 100 Link Power

Then after that, for every additional mark you get an additional 10 Link Power.
The max Link Power you can give is 150.

Q: I can't find MniGrnde2 or MniGrnde3! It's not in the locations you listed!
   Please help!!!
   
   MniGrnde2 and 3 are in Green Mystery Waves, you can run through 20 times
   and not get them. Just be patient, you will get them eventually.
   
Q: Can you post the Wave Command Kit codes?

   No, I will not.
   
Q: Will you please be my Brother?

   I already have 6 brothers.
