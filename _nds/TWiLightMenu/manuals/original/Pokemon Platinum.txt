1. Intro

Hello all! This is my first FAQ that I’m doing go easy if I’m doing 
something wrong. First of all; I love Diamond and Pearl and I’m 
strongly anticipating Platinum to come to the U.S so I spent most of my 
days getting info or so much as a whisper on what’s going on and now it 
has all come to this. Now as a heads-up; THEIR WILL BE SPOILERS. Many 
spoilers and this will only just go up to the battle with the Champion. 
When I put the wild pokemon Locations, it will be like this. (Pokemon-
Where to Find-Chance to See It-Type) 

-----------------
2. Legal Stuff
-----------------
I am not with Nintendo, the Pokemon Company or etc. by any means. 
Everything in this walkthrough is Copyright 2008 by Peacemaker 14. 
(Though I do give most of the credit to Psypoke as I 
found most of the information there). You cannot use this walkthrough 
on your site unless I give the A-OK. So in other words; Hands-off 
unless I say you can! Also you can’t copy any part of this, you can 
print it out if you like (Hey fool, you want to use up all your paper, 
fine I wont stop you.) Alright then, now that this is all done with, 
let’s begin our adventure in Sinnoh!

----------------------
3. The Game Intro
----------------------
You will see the usual thing in Pokemon games: Professor comes up, 
explains about Pokemon, you choose your gender, name, and then your 
rival’s name. Now you’re ready to go.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 Roark’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------
4.1: Twinleaf Town
------------------------
Once the news is over, your rival will start talking to you. Go 
downstairs and your Mom will talk to you too before you leave. Go to 
the top-left house in the town, when you go to the front door your 
rival will bump into you, but will go back inside. Follow him in and go 
upstairs. He’ll then go outside to Route 201, follow him.
------------------
4.2: Route 201
------------------
--Route 201 Wild Pokemon----------------------------------------------- 
*	Starly-Tall Grass-50%-Normal/Flying
*	Bidoof- Tall Grass- 40%- Normal
*	Kricketot- Tall Grass- 10%- Bug
*	Growlithe- Fire Red in GBA slot- Fire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Professor Rowan will come to you both and will offer you a Pokemon: 
Turtwig, Chimchar and Piplup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Stats ---
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Turtwig:
Grass Type
HP: 55
ATK: 68
DEF: 64
SP. ATK: 45
SP. DEF: 55
SPD: 31
EVO: Grotle at Lv18
          Torterra at Lv32
Overall: Turtwig has the best Attack and Defense points compared to the 
others, and once he goes to Torterra, he’s part Ground type too. Now 
this is what I choose in Diamond and it’s been working out, the sad 
thing is that he is hopelessly slow. Grotle also learns Bite at Lv21 so 
you can have something for the third Gym. Turtwig is able to learn Dark 
moves along with Grass and Earthquake when he evolves at Torterra, but 
he has some common weaknesses like Fire and Bug. But he is also immune 
to Electric types. I say Turtwig is a good choice for people that have 
been playing for a while. 

Chimchar:
Fire Type
HP: 44
ATK: 58
DEF: 44
SP. ATK: 58
SP. DEF: 44
SPD: 61
EVO: Monferno at Lv14
          Infernape at Lv36
Overall: Speed is the trump card for Chimchar. He has a pretty good 
Attack and Special Attack but the Defense and Special Defense are 
pretty poor so you’re going to need some tough moves to give Chimchar. 
When he gets to Monferno, he will be part Fighting type giving you an 
advantage for the first gym. Infernape is an alright Pokemon, you got 
your ups and downs. He can give quite a beat down on some of the other 
types but has also acquired a weakness of Flying and Psychic type moves 
from what you’ll see from your rival. This guy is pretty good for 
veteran players or those who want a challenge because he has some 
disadvantages in most gyms.

Piplup:
Water Type
HP: 53
ATK: 51
DEF: 53
SP. ATK: 61
SP. DEF: 56
SPD: 40
EVO: Prinplup at Lv16
          Empoleon at Lv36

Overall: Piplup’s Special Attack and Special Defense are better by a 
little and the other stats are average. He also has a bigger array of 
moves to learn also. Once he’s Empoleon you will be part Steel type 
giving you quite the advantage. Empoleon has only 3 weaknesses, 11 
resistances and is immune to Poison-type attacks, and one of the 
resistances is the legendary Dragon types. You’ll also start learning 
Flying type moves periodically, which will take care of your weakness 
to Fighting. This is a choice for beginners or those who want an easy 
win.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Professor Rowan will take his leave and you and your rival will test 
out your Pokemon. They are Lv5 and whatever Pokemon you choose, he will 
choose the weakness of it.

--Boss 1---Rival-------------------------------------------------------
If you choose Turtwig: 
*	Lv5 Chimchar: Fire
o	Scratch, Leer
If you choose Chimchar:
*	Lv5 Piplup: Water: 
o	Pound, Growl
If you choose Piplup:
*	Lv5 Turtwig: Grass 
o	Tackle, Withdraw.

Suggested Level: 5
Advice: A very simple battle, keep hitting him and use Stat affecters 
like Leer if needed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle you will be home, fully healed. Talk to your Mom and 
she will give you the Running Shoes that will make you faster when you 
hold down the B-button. Go to Route 201 and you will see your rival 
again telling you to go to Lake Verity. Go left then up to the entrance. 
At the lake you will see Cyrus who will talk to you and your rival 
before leaving. You will then hear a cry a little later on. Now head 
for Sandgem Town which is on the right of Route 201.

------------------------
4.3: Sandgem Town
------------------------
You’ll see Rowan’s assistant when you arrive in Sandgem and will take 
you to the lab to see Professor Rowan. He will give you a Pokedex then 
leave and he will give you TM27-Return.

Then the assistant will show you the two places you’ll be using on the 
journey: the Pokemon Center and the Pokemart. Then the assistant will 
go to Route 202, but you need to go to Twinleaf to get the Journal key 
item from your Mom and your rival’s mom will come to give you a package 
you need to give to your rival. Once you’ve gotten the items, head to 
Route 202 which is north of Sandgem.

-----------------
4.4: Route 202
-----------------

--Route 202 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Shinx-Tall Grass-30%-Electric
*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-40%-Normal
*	Starly-Tall Grass-20%-Normal/Flying
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Growlithe-Fire Red in GBA slot
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The assistant will give a “How-To” on catching Pokemon and will give 
you 5 pokeballs. Now head north to Jubilife City.

--------------------
4.5: Jubilife City
--------------------
You will see the assistant and point you through the city, you will 
also see the Detective here, and you will see him plenty of times. The 
assistant will then take you to the Trainer’s school, go inside and see 
that your rival is there to, give him the package and you will get a 
Town Map. Now leave and talk to the Poketch Company President. Then 
find the three clowns in the city. One is close to the Pokemart, 
another is outside the Poketch Company building, and the last is at the 
TV Station. When you find them all, go to the President and he will 
give you a Poketch. Now go to Route 203 which is right of Jubilife.

------------------
4.6: Route 203
------------------

--Route 203 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Starly-Tall Grass-35%-Normal/Flying
*	Shinx-Tall Grass-25%-Electric
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-15%-Normal
*	Abra-Tall Grass-15%-Psychic
*	Seedot-Ruby in GBA slot-Grass
*	Lotad-Sapphire in GBA slot-Grass/Water
*	Pineco-Emerald in GBA slot-Bug
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your rival will meet up with you once you go in the Route and will 
challenge you to a match.

--Boss 2---Rival-------------------------------------------------------
If you choose Turtwig:
*	Lv7 Starly-Normal/Flying
o	Growl, Quick Attack
*	Lv9 Chimchar-Fire
o	Scratch, Leer
If you choose Chimchar:
*	Lv7 Starly-Normal/Flying
o	Growl, Quick Attack
*	Lv9 Piplup-Water
o	Pound, Growl
If you choose Piplup:
*	Lv7 Starly-Normal/Flying
o	Growl, Quick Attack
*	Lv9 Turtwig-Grass
o	Tackle, Withdraw

Suggested Lv: 8
Advice: You should be stronger right now and have caught some new 
Pokemon for your team. Your rival now has a Starly in his arsenal and 
he only knows Quick Attack for Attacking you. Just keep hitting his 
team and do the same as your last battle, this won’t be too difficult.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once that is over with go to the Oreburgh Gate that’s at the top-right 
of the 203.

-----------------------
4.7: Oreburgh Gate
-----------------------

--Oreburgh Gate Wild Pokemon-------------------------------------------
*	Zubat-Cave-50%-Poison/Flying
*	Psyduck-Cave-35%-Water
*	Geodude-Cave-15%-Rock/Ground
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There will be a man at the entrance that will give you the HM06 that 
will help you break cracked rocks around the world but you’ll need the 
first badge for that. Now just go straight ahead till you’re at 
Oreburgh.

-----------------------
4.8: Oreburgh City
-----------------------

Once you’re out of the cave, you will be taken to the gym by a resident 
of the city only to find your rival, telling you the gym is closed and 
Roark is in the mine. The mine is in the southern part of Oreburgh.

------------------------
4.9: Oreburgh Mine
------------------------

--Oreburgh Mine 1st Floor & Basement Wild Pokemon-----------------------
*	Geodude-Cave-65%-Rock/Ground
*	Zubat-Cave-25%-Poison/Flying
*	Onix-Cave-10%-Rock/Ground
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Roark is in the deeper part of the Mine, you’ll now it’s him by the red 
helmet he has on. Once you find him, talk to him, and then he’ll go to 
the Gym. Now leave the mines and go back to the Gym.

-------------------------
4.10: Oreburgh Gym
-------------------------

There are two trainers in the Gym, you can fight them before Roark or 
you can go around them and only battle Roark.

(--Boss 3---Oreburgh Gym Leader Roark---------------------------------)
*	Lv12 Geodude-Rock/Ground
o	Rock Throw, Stealth Rock
*	Lv12 Onix-Rock/Ground
o	Screech, Rock Throw, Stealth Rock
*	Lv 14 Cranidos-Rock
o	Headbutt, Leer, Pursuit

Suggested Lv: 13
Advice: Turtwig and Piplup can sweep through this Gym easily, Chimchar 
will have some trouble with it though, you can catch a Psyduck from the 
Gate or a Machop from Route 207, North of Oreburgh to help. This will 
be dramatically easy if you’ve been training hard enough and you 
exploit the weaknesses.
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

Once you win, Roark will give you the Coal Badge and TM76-Stealth Rock. 
Now head back to Jubilife.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0: Gardenia’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------

---------------------

You will see Professor Rowan and his assistant harassed by two Galactic 
Grunts. You’ll team up with the assistant and Double Battle them. Once 
you win, you will be given a Fashion Case from a random passerby. Go 
North and you’ll see a cave (Ravaged Path) go inside there.

----------------------
5.3: Ravaged Path
----------------------

--Ravaged Path Wild Pokemon--------------------------------------------
*	Zubat-Cave-65%-Poison/Flying
*	Psyduck-Cave-35%-Water
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You’ll need to teach a Pokemon Rock Smash to get through the rocks 
blocking the exit on the right.

------------------
5.4: Route 204
------------------

--Northern Route 204 Wild Pokemon--------------------------------------

*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-25%-Normal
*	Wurmple-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Budew-Tall Grass-15%-Grass/Poison
*	Shinx-Tall Grass-15%-Electric

*	Lotad-Sapphire in GBA slot-Grass/Water
*	Pineco-Emerald in GBA slot-Bug
*	Caterpie-Fire Red in GBA slot-Bug
*	Weedle-Leaf Green in GBA slot-Bug/Poison
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing much here, just make your way to Floaroma Town up North.

-------------------------
5.5: Floaroma Town
-------------------------

Not much to do except heal your team and go right to the Valley 
Windworks right of the Town.

----------------------------
5.6: Valley Windworks
----------------------------

--Valley Windworks Wild Pokemon----------------------------------------
*	Shellos-Tall Grass-45%-Water
*	Shinx-Tall Grass-25%-Electric
*	Buizel-Tall Grass-25%-Water
*	Pachirisu-Tall Grass-10%-Electric
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You’ll see a girl standing in the middle of the path to the Windworks 
talk to her then proceed to the Windworks. Once you’re there, you’ll 
see a Grunt guarding the door, battle him. Once you win, he’ll go 
inside and lock the door. Go back to the town and go North to the 
meadow where two Grunts are harassing a man. You’ll battle them one at 
a time and they will flee once you win and you’ll be given the Works 
Key and some Honey to attract Pokemon on big-yellowish trees. Go back 
to the Works and open the door. Once you’re in a Grunt will see you and 
alert the Commander. Fight your way through the Works and you’ll meet 
with Commander Mars holding the girl’s father hostage.

--Boss 4---Commander Mars----------------------------------------------
*	Lv15 Zubat: Poison/Flying
o	Toxic, Bite, Leech Life
*	Lv17 Purugly: Normal
o	Scratch, Faint Attack, Fake Out

Suggested Lv: 16-17
Advice: Okay, this is where things get a little dicey. Zubat’s Toxic 
can be annoying so be careful. Purugly will not be a walk in the park 
to beat easily, just keep slamming it with attacks and be cautious of 
Faint Attack, it doesn’t miss.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Team Galactic will flee, the girl is able to see her dad again and the 
Detective comes to do a quick inspection on the Windworks. You can now 
go to Route 205.

------------------
5.7: Route 205
------------------

*	Shellos-Tall Grass-65%-Water
*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-10%-Normal
*	Buizel-Tall Grass-15%-Water
*	Pachirisu-Tall Grass-10%-Electric

*	Wurmple-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Budew-Tall Grass-30%-Grass/Poison

and your Pokemon will be healed at the end of a battle. The end of the 
forest is at the top-right hand side, once you make it, Cheryl will 
give you a Soothe Bell for your trouble. Now exit the forest.

------------------
5.9: Route 205
------------------

--Northern Route 205 Wild Pokemon--------------------------------------
*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-30%-Normal
*	Wurmple-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Budew-Tall Grass-28%-Grass/Poison
*	Silcoon-Tall Grass-10%-Bug

*	Beautifly-Tall Grass-1%-Bug/Flying
*	Dustox-Tall Grass-1%-Bug/Poison
*	Hoothoot-Night-Normal/Flying
*	Lotad-Sapphire in GBA slot-Grass/Water
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing important here so keep going to Eterna City.

---------------------
5.10: Eterna City
---------------------

Go to the house next to the Pokemon Center and a man will give you the 
Explorer Kit letting you go underground and now has Wifi connection in 
there. Next, go up and take a left and you will bump into your rival. 
Go to the statue further right and you’ll see Cyrus again. He then 
leaves along with your rival. Then go to the Pokemon Center and you’ll 
see a woman named Cynthia who gives you HM01-Cut which cuts the little 
trees. Now that all that is out of the way, let’s head to the Gym.

----------------------
5.11: Eterna Gym
----------------------

The Gym will have a Flower-like clock in the center, you need to beat 
the four trainers before Gardenia, each time you beat a trainer the 
clock will move.

(--Boss 5---Eterna Gym Leader Gardenia--------------------------------)
*	Lv20 Turtwig: Grass
o	Grass Knot, Razor Leaf, Sunny Day, Reflect
*	Lv20 Cherrim: Grass
o	Grass Knot, Leech Seed, Magical Leaf, Safeguard
*	Lv22 Roserade: Grass/Poison
o	Grass Knot, Magical Leaf, Poison Sting, Stun Spore

Suggested Lv: 20
Advice: Chimchar or any flying type can deal with this place. If you 
have their weaknesses you can win easily. 
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

You will gain the Forest Badge and TM86-Grass Knot from Gardenia after 
your win.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.0: Fantina’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------
6.1: Team Galactic Building
-----------------------------------

Teach a Pokemon Cut and slash the trees in the northern building’s way 
and go inside. The Detective in a disguise will talk with you once your 
in. Go up the stairs on the left, the stairs on the right, the stairs 
on the left and the stairs on the left. You will see a second Galactic 
Commander and a man talking. Talk to the Commander.

--Boss 6---Commander Jupiter-------------------------------------------
*	Lv21 Zubat: Poison/Flying
o	Giga Drain, Bite, Wing Attack
*	Lv23 Skuntank: Poison/Dark
o	Night Slash, Poison Gas, Screech, Smokescreen

Suggested Lv: 22
Advice: Why can’t the Commanders have Bug Pokemon so we can sweep them 
easily? Ah well, no sense complaining about it. Zubat isn’t that much 
of a challenge if you’ve been training with a Rock or Electric type. 
Skuntank’s moves can be a little devastating if you’re not careful. 
Bring some Antidotes just in case of Poison Gas. You’re going to need a 
defender for Night Slash because it has a high critical-hit ratio.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After you defeat Jupiter, Team Galactic will flee. The guy you saved 
was the Bike Store Owner; go to his store south of the Pokemon center. 
You will also run into Cynthia and she will offer you a Togepi egg. 
Once you get the egg, go inside the shop and get the bike. You’ll need 
to go back down to Oreburgh and enter Mt. Coronet there because you 
cant go far in the entrance in Eterna so go to Cycling Road, South of 
Eterna.

----------------------
6.2: Cycling Road
----------------------

Before you go in Cycling Road go talk to the Aide for him to give you 
an Exp. Share but you need to have seen at least 35 pokemon. You have 
to mount your bike before you go in Cycling Road. Under Cycling Road 
there is Route 206 so once you get out of Cycling Road, you can go to 
the side and cut the branches blocking it.

------------------
6.3: Route 206
------------------

--Route 206 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Ponyta-Tall Grass-20%-Fire
*	Geodude-Tall Grass-30%-Rock/Ground
*	Gligar-Tall Grass-20%-Ground/Flying
*	Kricketune-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Machop-Tall Grass-20%-Fighting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------
6.4: Route 207
------------------

--Route 207 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Machop-Tall Grass-30%-Fighting
*	Kricketot-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
*	Geodude-Tall Grass-30%-Rock/Ground
*	Ponyta-Tall Grass-25%-Fire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep going right and you’ll find the entrance to Mt. Coronet.

--------------------
6.5: Mt. Coronet
--------------------

--Southern Mt. Coronet Wild Pokemon------------------------------------
*	Machop-Cave-10%-Fighting

This is only a small faction of Mt. Coronet and trust me when I say the 
real Mt. Coronet is longer and bigger. Just keep going right and you’ll 
see Cyrus again, he’ll talk to you then he’ll leave. Keep going till 
you’re at Route 208.

------------------
6.6: Route 208
------------------

--Route 208 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Budew-Tall Grass-30%-Grass/Poison
*	Bidoof-Tall Grass-20%-Normal
*	Ralts-Tall Grass-15%-Psychic
*	Roselia-Tall Grass-15%-Grass/Poison
*	Bibareal-Tall Grass-20%-Normal/Water
*	Zubat-Night-Poison/Flying

*	Seviper-Sapphire in GBA slot-Poison
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing that useful except the man close to the tree in the South will 
give you an Odd Keystone, which can get you Spiritomb by talking to 
people underground 32 times. So go to the right and you’ll be in 
Hearthome City.

-------------------------
6.7: Hearthome City
-------------------------

Once you’re in the city, a Buneary will run into you and its trainer 
will come chasing after it. The trainer then asks if you could go to 
the Pokemon Contest Center, a large gray building. Once you’re inside 
you will see your Mom and will talk about Contests. Once that’s over, 
find the woman in purple she’s the next Gym Leader. Once you talked to 
her you should do a couple things: Go to the house next to the Pokemon 
Center to meet Bebe, she runs the Box Systems in the PC. She will give 
you an Eevee if you talk to her; make sure to keep a spot in your team 
open. Next, go to the house right of the Pokemart and talk to the Old 
Man. He will give you a Poffin Case. Now that those are done, let’s go 
to the Gym.

--------------------------
6.8: Hearthome Gym
--------------------------

The gym will be dark, quite dark and the only sources of light is your 
flashlight and the Duskull Eyes. What you have to do in this Gym is 
find a Blue Tile with a picture on it, then go in the door with the 
same picture on the Red Tile. As you move on, the pattern changes and 
if you pick the wrong door you have to start over.

(--Boss 7---Hearthome Gym Leader Fantina------------------------------)
*	Lv24 Duskull: Ghost
o	Will-o-Wisp, Pursuit, Shadow Sneak, Future Sight
*	Lv24 Haunter: Ghost/Poison
o	Shadow Claw, Sucker Punch, Hypnosis, Confuse Ray
*	Lv26 Mismagius: Ghost
o	Shadow Ball, Psybeam, Magical Leaf, Confuse Ray

Suggested Lv: 25-26
Advice: This is going to be an annoying battle for you. Ghosts don’t 
have much weaknesses and Confuse Ray will make you want to snap your DS 
in half. (but let’s not do that) Get a Normal Type with non-normal and 
non-fighting type moves so you’re immune. Or if you have Turtwig that 
knows Bite, use that like crazy on her Pokemon.
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

Once you defeat Fantina, you will gain the Relic Badge so you can use 
Surf outside of battle and TM65-Shadow Claw which is very good in 
battle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.0: Maylene’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On the way out of Hearthome to the right, you’ll meet up with your 
rival and will have a battle.

--Boss 8---Rival-------------------------------------------------------
If you choose Turtwig:
*	Lv25 Staravia: Normal/Flying
o	Wing Attack, Quick Attack, Endeavor, Double Team
*	Lv23 Buizel: Water
o	Water Gun, Quick Attack, Pursuit, Growl
*	Lv23 Roselia: Grass/Poison
o	Mega Drain, Poison Sting, Leech Seed, Stun Spore

If you choose Chimchar:
*	Lv25 Staravia: Normal/Flying
o	Wing Attack, Quick Attack, Endeavor, Double Team
*	Lv23 Roselia: Grass/Poison
o	Mega Drain, Poison Sting, Leech Seed, Stun Spore
*	Lv23 Ponyta: Fire
o	Ember, Tackle, Tail Whip, Growl
*	Lv27 Prinplup: Water
o	Bubblebeam, Peck, Metal Claw, Growl
If you choose Piplup:
*	Lv25 Staravia: Normal/Flying
o	Wing Attack, Quick Attack, Endeavor, Double Team
*	Lv23 Buizel: Water
o	Water Gun, Quick Attack, Pursuit, Growl
*	Lv23 Ponyta: Fire
o	Ember, Tackle, Tail Whip, Growl
*	Lv27 Grotle: Grass
o	Razor Leaf, Tackle, Absorb, Withdraw

Suggested Lv: 26-27
Advice: This battle can be easy with the right types. Staravia can be 
taken down by an Electric or Rock move. Roselia and Grotle can be 
beaten by a Fire or Flying move. Buizel and Prinplup can be killed by a 
Grass or Electric move. Ponyta and Monferno can be killed by a Water or 
Ground move. Hit them with their weaknesses or strong attacks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, head out to Route 209.

------------------
7.1: Route 209
------------------

--Route 209 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Roselia-Tall Grass-25%-Grass/Poison

*	Ralts-Tall Grass-20%-Psychic
*	Chansey-Tall Grass-5%-Normal
*	Zubat-Night-Poison/Flying
*	Duskull-Night-Ghost
*	Vulpix-Leaf Green in GBA slot-Fire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On a corner of the 209, there is a small-rocky structure called the 
Hallowed Tower. You put the Odd Keystone in there for Spiritomb.

-------------------
7.2: Lost Tower
-------------------

--Lost Tower 1st Floor Wild Pokemon------------------------------------
*	Gastly-Cave-65%-Ghost/Poison
*	Zubat-Cave-35%-Poison/Flying

*	Golbat-Cave-10%-Poison/Flying
*	Duskull-Night-Ghost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Lost Tower is North of Hallowed Tower. The only things you can do 
are training and look for TM27-Shadow Ball. Further up from this place 
will be Solaceon Town.

------------------------
7.3: Solaceon Town
------------------------

The most useful place in Solaceon is the Day Care for Lv ups and Eggs. 
You can put a Pokemon in the daycare, leave and then come back for it 
and a guy will give you a new Poketch App. Now head right of the 
daycare and you’ll see some ledges, go down them and you’ll see the 
Solaceon Ruins.

------------------------
7.4: Solaceon Ruins
------------------------

--Solaceon Ruins Wild Pokemon------------------------------------------
*	Unown-Cave-100%-Psychic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HM05 is in this Cavern so let’s scope it out. Take the top right stairs, 
the bottom left, top right, top left, top left then bottom left. You’ll 
arrive in a room with four items: A Nugget, A Mind Plate, The Odd 
Incense, and HM05. There’s a ball on a ledge, to get that, you’ll need 
to get all 28 forms of Unown and meet the Ruin Maniac. There’s nothing 
else to do in Solaceon so go to Route 210, North of Solaceon.

------------------
7.5: Route 210
------------------

--Route 210 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Roselia-Tall Grass-15%-Grass/Poison

*	Seedot-Ruby in GBA slot-Grass
*	Nuzleaf-Ruby in GBA slot-Grass/Dark
*	Pineco-Emerald in GBA slot-Bug
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep going North and use your bike to go over the mud. Take a right 
when you’re out of the overgrown grass. Psyduck block the way to the 
road further North.

------------------
7.6: Route 215
------------------

--Route 215 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Staravia-Tall Grass-30%-Normal/Flying

*	Kadabra-Tall Grass-10%-Psychic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rain. Lots and Lots of Rain. Veilstone is at the far right end of this 
raining Route.

-----------------------
7.7: Veilstone City
-----------------------

Ah Veilstone, Gambling time. Here you can play in the Game Corner and 
shop at the very oversized Mart. You’ll also notice that Team 
Galactic’s presence is here on the top of the city and meteorites on 
the right. These aren’t your regular meteorites; these are from the 
legendary Pokemon Deoxys and each has one its forms: Normal, Attack, 
Defend, and Speed. Once you head to the Gym you’ll see Rowan’s 
assistant and start talking, then Crasher Wake of the Pastoria Gym 
appears out of this Gym and talks to you both. Then once they both 
leave, you can go in the Gym.

------------------------
7.8: Veilstone Gym
------------------------

To get by, you’ll need to use the punching bags to knock over things 
like the tires. It’s not too hard to do so once you’re there have your 
match with Maylene.

(--Boss 9---Veilstone Gym Leader Maylene------------------------------)
*	Lv28 Meditite: Psychic/Fighting
o	Drain Punch, Confusion, Rock Tomb, Fake Out
*	Lv29 Machoke: Fighting
o	Karate Chop, Rock Tomb, Strength, Focus Energy
*	Lv32 Lucario: Steel/Fighting
o	Drain Punch, Force Palm, Metal Claw, Bone Rush


Suggested Lv: 31
Advice: Okay by now you should have a decent team. Maylene covered all 
her team’s weaknesses and this won’t be an easy feat. Okay, Meditite 
can killed by a basic Dark or Ghost type move or if you caught a Gastly 
and did some training, but if you did catch one, be careful of 
Confusion because it has 4x Weakness. I urge you to use Flying types 
cautiously against Meditite and Machoke. Their Rock Tomb can spell 
disaster so you’ll need to work fast. Now for Mr. Wannabe Legendary: 
Lucario. He will give Fire types a hard time with Bone Rush. A Fighting 
type can cause good damage to Lucario so try using that.
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

You will be given the Cobble Badge and TM60 Drain Punch witch works 
like Giga Drain: for how much you damaged your opponent, you get half 
back in health.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.0: Crasher Wake’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------
8.1: Galactic Warehouse
------------------------------

Once you’re out of the Gym you’ll find that the assistant’s Pokedex was 
stolen by Team Galactic. Go to the Warehouse near Route 215 and you’ll 
Double Battle the Grunts. After the battle, the Grunts will run inside 
and you will meet the Detective and follow him inside. All the Grunts 
have left but HM02 is in there so it’s not a total bust. Now go South 
of Veilstone to Route 214.

------------------
8.2: Route 214
------------------

--Route 214 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Graveler-Tall Grass-35%-Rock/Ground
*	Geodude-Tall Grass-20%-Rock/Ground
*	Rhyhorn-Tall Grass-30%-Rock/Ground
*	Houndour-Tall Grass-15%-Dark/Fire
*	Zubat-Night-Poison/Flying
*	Vulpix-Leaf Green in GBA slot-Fire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find the Ruin Maniac in a cavern a little away from 
Veilstone. He’ll challenge you to find the 26 alphabetical Unown and 
has even made a secret path to the Ruins. You can also find the Dig TM 
here. Keep going south to get to Valor Lakefront.

--------------------------
8.3: Valor Lakefront
--------------------------

--Valor Lakefront Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------
*	Girafarig-Tall Grass-25%-Normal/Psychic
*	Staravia-Tall Grass-25%-Normal/Flying
*	Bibareal-Tall Grass-30%-Normal/Water
*	Houndour-Tall Grass-10%-Dark/Fire
*	Kricketune-Tall Grass-10%-Bug
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The lake will be blocked by a couple of guys so keep going down, you 
can’t turn right because Sunnyshore just had a power outage. So you’re 
pretty much at this resort. You can battle random people here and the 
house farther down can heal your team. Since all you can do is train, 
do a little of that and go down to Route 213.

------------------
8.4: Route 213
------------------

--Route 213 Wild Pokemon-----------------------------------------------
*	Wingull-Tall Grass-20%-Water/Flying
*	Chatot-Tall Grass-20%-Normal/Flying
*	Buizel-Tall Grass-25%-Water
*	Shellos-Tall Grass-35%-Water
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Isn’t much to do here but battle, so keep heading right to Pastoria.

----------------------
8.5: Pastoria City
----------------------

Two Words people. SAFARI ZONE! You will get plenty of Pokemon here so 
pay it a visit. When you’re done there and done training, head to the 
Gym. But before you go in, your rival is going to come test your 
abilities.

--Boss 10---Rival------------------------------------------------------
If you choose Turtwig:
*	Lv34 Staravia: Normal/Flying
o	Wing Attack, Quick Attack, Endeavor, Double Team

o	Wing Attack, Quick Attack, Endeavor, Double Team
*	Lv32 Buizel: Water
o	Aqua Jet, Quick Attack, Pursuit, Growl
*	Lv32 Ponyta: Fire
o	Ember, Stomp, Tail Whip, Growl
*	Lv36 Grotle: Grass
o	Razor Leaf, Bite, Mega Drain, Withdraw

Suggested Lv: 34
Advice: Same as your last battle with him, just stronger. The moves 
have barely changed. Just like before this battle can be easy with the 
right types. Staravia can be taken down by an Electric or Rock move. 
Roselia and Grotle can be beaten by a Fire or Flying move. Buizel and 
Prinplup can be killed by a Grass or Electric move. Ponyta and Monferno 
can be killed by a Water or Ground move. Hit them with their weaknesses 
or strong attacks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you beat him, he’ll run off and let you go in the Gym.

----------------------
8.6: Pastoria Gym
----------------------

The layout in the Gym isn’t different from Diamond and Pearl so for 
those that played it, this should be cake. 

(--Boss 11---Pastoria Gym Leader Crasher Wake-------------------------)
*	Lv33 Gyarados: Water/Flying
o	Brine, Waterfall, Bite, Twister
*	Lv34 Quagsire: Water/Ground
o	Mud Bomb, Rock Tomb, Water Pulse, Yawn
*	Lv37 Floatzel: Water
o	 Brine, Ice Fang, Crunch, Ice Fang

Suggested Lv: 35-36
Advice: If you thought the rival battle was hard then you’re in for a 
wild ride. Turtwig or any Grass type would be great against Quagsire. 
Use an Electric for Gyarados to knock him clean. Don’t use a grass type 
on Floatzel, his Ice Fang will destroy Grass types. Stick to Electric 
on that too. Brine will become truly strong when your opponent’s health 
is less than half.
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

When you beat Wake, you will gain the Fen Badge and TM55 Brine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.0: Byron’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will meet your rival outside of the Gym and will talk to you. Wake 
will then come out of the Gym and talks to both of you. Chase the 
Galactic Grunt from the Great Marsh to the East and you’ll meet the 
Detective on Route 213. Talk to him at the reception office and then go 
up to the Lakefront to find the Grunt then battle him. Once you beat 
him, Cynthia and your rival will appear. You’ll be given the 
SecretPotion to cure the Psyduck  from Route 210, and the Fly HM. So go 
back to Solaceon and use the potion. Once they leave, Cynthia will give 
you the Old Charm and will tell you to go to Celestic Town.

You should use Defog here. Celestic Town will be on the left side and 
if you see thin planks, use your bike to get over it.

-----------------------
9.2: Celestic Town
-----------------------

Talk to the woman left of the Pokemon Center, she tells you about the 
Galactic Grunt guarding the shrine so battle him. You will be thanked, 
then give her the Old Charm and go in the shrine. Look at the picture 
of the Psychic Trio and the Cyrus will come and battle you

--Boss 12---Galactic Boss Cyrus----------------------------------------
*	Lv34 Sneasel: Dark/Ice
o	Slash, Ice Punch, Quick Attack, Screech
*	Lv34 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Poison Fang, Air Cutter, Bite, Supersonic
*	Lv36 Murkrow: Dark/Flying
o	Drill Peck, Night Shade, Astonish, Faint Attack

Suggested Lv: 38
Advice: You will have a tough time dealing with these guys. 1. They’re 
fast. 2. They have annoying moves and 3. He has a Sneasel and Sneasel’s 
are unbelievably fast. You’ll need a pretty fast Fire or Fighting type 
against Sneasel. Golbat can be taken down by a Psychic or Electric. 
Murkrow is also an annoying S.O.B. that you have to deal with. Use an 
Electric or Rock move on him for a quick win.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After your battle, Cyrus will disappear and the old woman will give you 
the Surf HM. Go to Jubilife and take a left to Route 218.

-----------------------

Once your in Canalave heal up and go to the bridge. Your rival will 
meet you there for another match.

o	Fire Spin, Stomp, Tail Whip, Take Down
*	Lv37 Torterra: Grass/Ground
o	Razor Leaf, Bite, Mega Drain, Leech Seed

Suggested Lv: 39
Advice: Hmm…Since when did he get Heracross? Ah well…Heracross has 4x 
weakness to Flying so this should be a cinch. Staraptor can be killed 
by a Rock or Electric move. Roserade and Torterra can be dealt with by 
a Fire or Flying move. Rapidash and Infernape are weak to Water and 
Ground and Infernape now has a weakness to Flying. Empoleon and 
Floatzel can be killed by an Electric or Grass move and Empoleon is now 
weak to Fighting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the lower-right part of the Gym and see a man close to a boat 
that will take you to Iron Island. Once you’re there, talk to a guy 
named Riley who will give you the Strength HM. Now you can train here 
to, but to go far inside the cave you’ll need to beat the Gym.

------------------------
9.5: Canalave Gym
------------------------

The layout is the same as the one in Diamond and Pearl so make your way 
to Byron for your battle.

(--Boss 14---Canalave Gym Leader Byron--------------------------------)
*	Lv37 Magneton: Electric/Steel
o	Flash Cannon, Tri-Attack, Thunderbolt, Metal Sound
*	Lv38 Steelix: Steel/Ground
o	Flash Cannon, Ice Fang, Earthquake, Sandstorm
*	Lv41 Bastiodon: Rock/Steel
o	Metal Burst, Stone Edge, Iron Defense, Taunt

Suggested Lv: 40-41
Advice: This battle is actually easier than you think. Use a Fire type 
to take out Magneton and use a Ground type to take on Steelix and 
Bastiodon. Pretty simple match.
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

Once you win, you’ll gain the Mine badge and TM91 Flash Cannon-a strong 
special steel type move.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
10.0: Candace’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------
10.1: Canalave City
------------------------

When you leave the Gym, you’ll see your rival and he will lead you to 
the Canalave library. Go to the top floor and you will see Professor 
Rowan and his assistant and you will talk about the Lakes but will be 
interrupted by an explosion that occurred at Lake Valor so investigate.

---------------------
10.2: Lake Valor
---------------------

When you see what’s happened in Lake Valor, you’ll see that the 
Magikarp are flailing helplessly on land. Go to the center of what was 
a lake to find the third Galactic Commander.

--Boss 15---Galactic Commander Saturn----------------------------------
*	Lv35 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Air Cutter, Bite, Toxic, Supersonic
*	Lv35 Bronzor: Psychic/Steel
o	Gyro Ball, Shadow Ball, Rock Tomb, Iron Defense
*	Lv37 Toxicroak: Poison/Fighting
o	Poison Jab, Mud Bomb, Revenge, Mud Bomb

Suggested Lv: 41
Advice: Psychic and Electric moves can destroy Golbat. Bronzor can only 
killed by Fire thanks to Levitate. Toxicroak will have a 4x weakness to 
Psychic and a weakness to Flying. Pretty simple battle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you beat Saturn, he’ll hint an operation on Lake Verity which is 
close to Twinleaf Town so fly there.

----------------------
10.3: Lake Verity
----------------------

Once you’re their, you’ll see Rowan and his assistant battling Team 
Galactic. You’ll also see a familiar face: Commander Mars.

--Boss 15---Galactic Commander Mars------------------------------------
*	Lv38 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Air Cutter, Bite, Toxic, Supersonic
*	Lv38 Bronzor: Psychic/Steel
o	Gyro Ball, Extrasensory, Confuse Ray, Iron Defense
*	Lv40 Purugly: Normal
o	Slash, Faint Attack, Hypnosis, Fake Out

Suggested Lv: 41-42
Advice: Same tactics for Golbat and Bronzor. Purugly just needs a good 
Fighting move but be careful of Fake Out, it flinches and it goes first.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mars will leave after you win and Professor Rowan will tell you to go 
see your Rival in Lake Acuity. You’re going to need  Pokemon that now 
Rock Smash, Strength, and Defog. Go to Celestic Town and go in Mt. 
Coronet there.

----------------------
10.4: Mt. Coronet
----------------------

Go up and use Strength on the boulder blocking the path, then keep 
going up and turn to the stairs to get to the basement of Mt. Coronet.

This place is riddled with trainers and snow making running difficult. 
Keep going left and if you see a small house then you can rest up your 
team there. Up North is Route 217.

Keep going up and behind the house you will find HM08 Rock Climb, now 
keep going North to get to the Acuity Lakefront.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You’ll see your rival at the top of a hill and you need the Rock Climb 
HM to get up there but you need to get the badge from Snowpoint so turn 
left.

--------------------------
10.8: Snowpoint City
--------------------------

Heal up and do a little training before taking on the Gym.

---------------------------
10.9: Snowpoint Gym
---------------------------

Destroy the snowballs in the way by running into them from levels 
further up. Now get ready for your next Gym battle.

(--Boss 16---Snowpoint Gym Leader Candace-----------------------------)

*	Lv42 Abomasnow: Ice/Grass
o	Avalanche, Wood Hammer, Water Pulse, Focus Blast
*	Lv44 Frosslass: Ice/Ghost
o	Blizzard, Double Team, Shadow Ball, Psychic

Suggested Lv: 43-44
Advice: Okay, for this match Fire types are quite useful, especially 
against Abomasnow. A Steel type is also useful—or in Piloswine’s case—a 
Steel type with levitate is useful. Kill Frosslass quickly or you will 
be sorry. Frosslass will use Double Team to annoy you like crazy. 
(/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

Once you beat her, you get the Icicle Badge and TM72 Avalanche that 
powers up if you’re the first to be hit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
11.0: Volkner’s Gym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------
11.1: Lake Acuity
----------------------

Use Rock Climb on the ledge you seen your rival at earlier. Then use it 
again to get to the entrance of the Lake. Once you’re their, you’ll 
find that your rival lost to Jupiter and is going to the HQ in 
Veilstone. Follow her.

-----------------------
11.2: Galactic HQ
-----------------------

Go to the HQ up north of the city and talk to the Grunt next to the 
satellites and he’ll run off. The Detective will then come and talk to 
you, then go to the warehouse on the left side of town and examine the 
doors. The Detective will then come to open the doors for you. Go 
follow him downstairs in the basement. Keep moving left until you see 
some stairs, head up two flights to find to warp pads. Take the pad on 
the left and go down to the basement to get the Galactic Key. Now leave 
the warehouse and go back to the HQ. Once your in, use the key on the 
door and go up the stairs until you see a guy watching TV. Take the 
warp pad in the TV room and you’ll see a cutscene in what looks to be 
an assembly area where Cyrus is having a speech and the Detective 
quietly listening. When the speech is over follow the Detective and 
take the warp pad and you’ll be in a room with beds to rest your team 
in. Go up the stairs and take the warp pad on the left will get you to 
Cyrus.

 --Boss 17---Galactic Boss Cyrus---------------------------------------
*	Lv44 Sneasel: Dark/Ice
o	Slash, Ice Punch, Quick Attack, Screech
*	Lv44 Crobat: Poison/Flying
o	Poison Fang, Air Cutter, Bite, Supersonic
*	Lv46 Honchkrow: Dark/Flying
o	Drill Peck, Night Slash, Astonish, Faint Attack

Suggested Lv: 45
Advice: Use a Fighting move to end Sneasel quickly. Honchkrow and 
Crobat can be destroyed by an Electric, and Rock. They’re still a 
pretty quick bunch so be careful.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, you will be given the greatest poke ball: the Master 
Ball. Now go to the warp pad on the far right of the room, go past the 
research pods and go to the back room. You’ll find the legendary 
Psychic trio trapped by Saturn. Talk to him and you will battle.

--Boss 18---Galactic Commander Saturn----------------------------------
*	Lv42 Bronzor: Steel/Psychic
o	Gyro Ball, Extrasensory, Shadow Ball, Confuse Ray
*	Lv42 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Poison Fang, Air Cutter, Bite, Confuse Ray
*	Lv46 Toxicroak: Fighting/Poison
o	Poison Jab, Brick Break, X-Scissor, Faint Attack

Suggested Lv: 45-46
Advice: This isn’t so bad compared to Cyrus. Use a Psychic move against 
Toxicroak and Golbat, which should take care of them easily. As for 
Bronzor, just hit him with a Fire Attack. The thing you’re going to 
need to look out for is their Confuse Rays witch will make you angry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you win, press the red button to set the Pokemon free. Then go 
back to where you battled Cyrus and go on the green warp pad that will 
get you out of the HQ. Buy some supplies and head to Oreburgh, then go 
inside Mt. Coronet from there. You’ll need a Pokemon that knows Rock 
Climb, Rock Smash, Surf, and Strength.

Use Surf on the Water a little North from the entrance. Then use Rock 
Climb on the cliff at the end of the narrow path and take the stairs to 
get to the second floor. The third floor is further up so keep going up 
and the Detective will catch up to you to give you a Black Flute.

11.4: Spear Pillar
---------------------

You’ll face a couple of Grunts in a Double Battle. After this, SAVE! 
SAVE DARN YOU! Next you will be roped in a battle between Mars and 
Jupiter and your rival comes right on que to help.

--Boss 19---Galactic Commanders Mars and Jupiter-----------------------
Commander Mars’ Pokemon
*	Lv44 Bronzor: Steel/Psychic
o	Gyro Ball, Extrasensory, Light Screen, Confuse Ray
*	Lv44 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Poison Fang, Air Cutter, Bite, Confuse Ray
*	Lv46 Purugly: Normal
o	Slash, Shadow Claw, Aerial Ace, Hypnosis
Commander Jupiter’s Pokemon
*	Lv44 Bronzor: Steel/Psychic
o	Gyro Ball, Extrasensory, Rock Slide, Reflect
*	Lv44 Golbat: Poison/Flying
o	Sludge Bomb, Air Cutter, Giga Drain, Mean Look
*	Lv46 Skuntank: Poison/Dark
o	Night Slash, Flamethrower, Poison Jab, Smokescreen

Suggested Lv: 50
Advice: Don’t be afraid to blast like crazy because you’ll be healed 
after this battle. The rival makes poor decisions in this battle and 
the only good thing about this is that he can take some hits too. The 
thing about this battle is that Mars will hand out Confuse Rays and 
Jupiter will clean up. Both Bronzors need to be hit by Fire because 
they have Levitate and that makes us all mad. The Golbats can be killed 
by a Psychic, Electric, or Ice move. Purugly can be killed by a 
Fighting type and Skuntank can be killed by a Ground.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your rival will heal you and run off. Cyrus will summon Dialga and 
Palkia and that will cause Giratina to arise from the Torn World. Cyrus 
will disappear into the World and Cynthia will come, so jump in the 
vortex.

----------------------
11.5: Torn World
----------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the place that’s more evil than the IRS 
Headquarters. This place and Giratina’s new form is probably the reason 
you gotten this game. Follow Cynthia through some pretty crazy terrain. 
Jump the ledge to get to her and walk on a sunken patch to activate an 
elevator. Then follow her across the floating pieces of land and you’ll 
see Mesprit so go towards him and you will fly onto the wall. When you 
get to the elevator with the two rocks, stand on the patch in the 
middle to activate its movement. Then go to the patch on the next 
platform and the left patch after that, and you’ll fly onto a wall were 
Cynthia’s waiting. Go right as far as you can, then down left into 
another set of moving platforms. Take the top patches to the next two 
platforms and you will meet up with Cyrus. Now the patches can make 
visible platforms invisible and vise-versa. Now head down, take a right, 
then go up and you’ll make a platform appear. Cross it then take the 
path going down to your right. Now cross that and keep going right 
until you get to a platform with five rocks. Activate it and cross the 
floating platforms to the left. Jump the ledge and use Strength on a 
boulder and push it down to the lower level, now go on the elevator but 
don’t use it yet. Go left and Mesprit will appear, telling you to drop 
the boulder into the chasm below and head to the elevator with five 
rocks on it and will ascend to the level above you. Head left and you 
will be on a platform with disappearing objects so stick to the outside 
while you make your way through. Go on the elevator with four rocks and 
you’ll be taken back to the magic platforms. Now hop across, go down 
and turn right to another elevator with four rocks on it, which will 
take you to Cyrus. Keep going and head up the wall and keep going 
upward. Surf the waterfall and you’ll end up right of where Uxie and 
Mesprit were. Drop the boulder into the gap Azelf is hovering over. Go 
left and take the elevator down. When the elevator stops moving, use 
Strength on the boulder and drop it close to the hole next to Uxie, and 
do the same for Mesprit and Azelf. Talk to Cynthia at the bottom level, 
and an elevator will appear to take you to Cyrus. Talk to him and 
battle.

o	Cross Poison, Air Slash, Confuse Ray, Toxic

o	Giga Impact, Water Fall, Ice Fang, Earthquake
*	Lv48 Weavile: Dark/Ice
o	Night Slash, Ice Punch, Fake Out, X-Scissor

Suggested Lv: 50-51
Advice: Don’t be afraid to hold back because Cynthia will heal your 
team when this battle is over. A Fighting type can take out Houndoom 
and Weavile easily, while the rest can be killed by an Electric type. 
Notice that Cyrus has many status afflicting moves which can be quite 
an annoyance. The biggest problem will be Weavile and his dangerous 
speed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, Cyrus will leave and you will be healed. Continue 
going up to meet Giratina and if you want capture him, I advise you to 
save before this.

Origin Form
Ghost/Dragon
Lv47
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*	Ominous Wind
*	Ancient Power
*	Dragon Claw
*	Shadow Force

Advice: Don’t use the Master Ball on him, and if you beat him, he’ll 
leave forever. Shadow Force makes Giratina invisible for one turn and 
strikes at the next so be prepared. Having a Pokemon with a high 
Defense out would be a good idea for this and having Giratina sleeping 
or paralyzed can help too.
(---------------------------------------------------------------------)

Cynthia and Cyrus will talk a little, then examine the portal and 
you’ll be sent to the Spring Path near Route 214.

Keep going right to get to Sunnyshore and don’t be afraid to get some 
training done.

---------------------------
11.8: Sunnyshore City
---------------------------

The Fire-user from the Elite Four known as Flint will come to you 
saying that the Gym leader has lost his “spark” for battling so talk to 
him at the Lighthouse at the lower left corner of the city. Once you 
talk to him, go to the Gym at the other side of town and you’ll see 
Flint again. Talk to him and he’ll move aside from the Gym.

-----------------------------
11.9: Sunnyshore Gym
-----------------------------

The layout of the Gym is just like the one in Diamond and Pearl’s and 
it’s very easy to navigate through so let’s beat the last Gym leader.

(--Boss 22---Sunnyshore Gym Leader Volkner----------------------------)
*	Lv46 Jolteon: Electric
o	Thunder Wave, Charge Beam, Iron Tail, Quick Attack
*	Lv46 Raichu: Electric
o	Charge Beam, Focus Blast, Signal Beam, Quick Attack
*	Lv48 Luxray: Electric
o	Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, Fire Fang, Crunch
*	Lv50 Electrivire: Electric
o	Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, Quick Attack, Giga Impact
Suggested Lv: 53
Advice: Torterra or any Ground type can make a Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
in this battle. But watch out for Luxray’s Ice Fang because that can 
cause trouble. Jolteon’s Iron Tail and Raichu’s Focus Blast can do 
serious damage to Rock types so hit them fast and hard.

You’ll need to cross this Route to get to Victory Road so get some 
supplies and get ready to leave. Before you go on the route, talk to 
Jasmine and she’ll give you the Waterfall HM which you’ll need to get 
to Victory Road. So just keep going North.

------------------------
12.2: Victory Road
------------------------

Before going into Victory Road you’re going to need a Pokemon that 
knows Rock Climb, Rock Smash, Surf, Waterfall, and Strength. It also 
wouldn’t be a bad idea to get some training done. Let’s start going 
into the cave.

*	Golbat-Cave-5%-Poison/Flying
*	Steelix-Cave-5%-Steel/Ground
*	Gabite-Cave-5%-Dragon/Ground
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the Bridges and if it seems like a dead end, use Rock Climb, go 
left but don’t jump the ledges or you’ll be forced to start over, climb 
the stairs and keep going past the trainer and you’ll see the path to 
the next floor.

--Victory Road 2nd Floor Wild Pokemon----------------------------------
*	Graveler-Cave-15%-Rock/Ground
*	Magneton-Cave-30%-Electric/Steel
*	Onix-Cave-5%-Rock/Ground
*	Golbat-Cave-5%-Poison/Flying
*	Steelix-Cave-40%-Steel/Ground
*	Gabite-Cave-5%-Dragon/Ground
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Rock Smash and Strength on the boulders in your way. You’ll need 
your bike to get over some ramps to get a Max Elixir. Now go down from 
the entrance and use Rock Smash on the rocks in the way. You’ll see two 
boulders, push the one furthest away and use Rock Smash on the rock in 
the way and go right. You’ll then see three rocks, push the top one to 
the right then go up to the first floor again. Keep going right and 
you’ll be in the basement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once your down, use Surf on the right and then Waterfall, then follow 
the path to another Waterfall but don’t descend it, just keep going 
left, go past the trainer and go to the stairs to the first floor ahead. 
Now on the path when it turns T-shaped head down and use Rock Climb on 
the ledge on the right, the ledge on the left has the Dark Pulse TM. 
Now once you’re up, cross the bridge and you are at the exit. Once 
you’re out, use Surf then Waterfall up to the Pokemon League.

----------------------------
12.3: Pokemon League

Whew, the Pokemon League, finally made it. This place has a Pokemon 
Center and Mart mixed together. Don’t buy heal items yet because you’ll 
be tempted to use them on what happens next. When come to the woman 
guarding the entrance to the Elite Four, your Rival will come for one 
last battle.

Suggested Lv: 55+
Advice: Staraptor with Close Combat will give you a bit of trouble, so 
shock it into submission with an Electric type. Heracross has 4x 
weakness to Flying so be quick about your attacks. Snorlax can and will 
be trouble with its high Defense and Rest, barrage it with Fighting 
type moves. You should be familiar with the last three by now so hit 
them where it hurts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once that’s over, heal up and start shopping, when you feel your ready 
go and fight the Elite Four. (It is quite possible to beat the Elite 
Four with Pokemon at least 50 but you’ll need plenty of heal items and 
Revives to get the job done.)

Elite Four Aaron
(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
*	Lv 49 Yanmega: Bug/Flying
o	Air Slash, Bug Buzz, U-Turn, Double Team
*	Lv49 Scizor: Bug/Steel
o	Iron Head, X-Scissor, Night Slash, Quick Attack
*	Lv50 Vespiquen: Bug/Flying
o	Attack Order, Defend Order, Heal Order, Power Gem
*	Lv51 Heracross: Bug/Fighting
o	Megahorn, Close Combat, Night Slash, Stone Edge
*	Lv53 Drapion: Poison/Dark
o	X-Scissor, Cross Poison, Ice Fang, Aerial Ace

Advice: Use Rock-Type moves for Yanmega and Vespiquen, Fire for Scizor, 
and Flying for Heracross. It confuses me how a Poison/Dark Type Drapion 
made the cut in this team but it sure is dangerous. Use a strong Ground 
move to kill him quickly because you will not like how strong it is.

12.5
Elite Four Bertha
(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
*	Lv50 Whiscash: Water/Ground
o	Earth Power, Aqua Tail, Zen Headbutt, Sandstorm
*	Lv53 Gliscor: Ground/Flying
o	Earthquake, Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, Fire Fang
*	Lv52 Hippowdon: Ground
o	Earthquake, Crunch, Stone Edge, Yawn
*	Lv52 Golem: Rock/Ground
o	Earthquake, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, Sandstorm
*	Lv55 Rhyperior: Ground/Rock
o	Earthquake, Rock Wrecker, Megahorn, Avalanche

Advice: Grass is going to be your friend in here but the majority of 
Pokemon in Bertha’s team have a move that can destroy Grass types so do 
this as quickly as possible. Water and Ice moves can also help with 
Gliscor but be mindful of the elemental Fang moves he has.
(---------------------------------------------------------------------) 

(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
12.6
Elite Four Flint
(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
*	Lv52 Houndoom: Dark/Fire
o	Flamethrower, Sunny Day, Sludge Bomb, Dark Pulse
*	Lv55 Flareon: Fire
o	Overheat, Giga Impact, Quick Attack, Will-o-Wisp
*	Lv53 Rapidash: Fire
o	Flare Blitz, Solarbeam, Bounce, Sunny Day
*	Lv55 Infernape: Fire/Fighting
o	Flare Blitz, Thunder Punch, Mach Punch, Earthquake
*	Lv57 Magmortar: Fire
o	Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Solarbeam, Hyper Beam

Advice: A Fighting type can take care of Houndoom. A Flying type has 
Infernape covered. Water or Ground types can take care of the rest but 
be careful of the Sunny Day-Solarbeam combo. If Sunny Day is still out, 
Solarbeam can be used whenever.
(---------------------------------------------------------------------) 

(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
12.7
Elite Four Lucian
(---------------------------------------------------------------------)
*	Lv53 Mr. Mime: Psychic
o	Psychic, Thunderbolt, Reflect, Light Screen
*	Lv55 Espeon: Psychic
o	Psychic, Shadow Ball, Quick Attack, Signal Beam
*	Lv54 Bronzong: Steel/Psychic
o	Psychic, Gyro Ball, Earthquake, Calm Mind
*	Lv56 Alakazam: Psychic
o	Psychic, Energy Ball, Focus Blast, Recover
*	Lv59 Gallade: Psychic/Fighting
o	Drain Punch, Psycho Cut, Leaf Blade, Stone Edge

Advice: Dark and Bug type moves are key in this fight, especially since 
Dark is unaffected to Psychic. But I wouldn’t use a Dark type on Espeon 
because of it’s Signal Beam move. Bronzong needs to be hit by a Fire 
move quickly before he uses Earthquake. Gallade has every weakness 
covered so you’ll need to work fast on this one.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
*	Lv58 Spiritomb: Ghost/Dark
o	Dark Pulse, Psychic, Silver Wind, Shadow Pulse
*	Lv58 Roserade: Grass/Poison
o	Energy Ball, Sludge Bomb, Toxic, Extrasensory
*	Lv60 Togekiss: Normal/Flying
o	Air Slash, Aura Sphere, Water Pulse, Shock Wave
*	Lv60 Lucario: Fighting/Steel
o	Aura Sphere, Extremespeed, Shadow Ball, Stone Edge
*	Lv58 Milotic: Water
o	Surf, Ice Beam, Mirror Coat, Dragon Pulse
*	Lv62 Garchomp: Dragon/Ground
o	Dragon Rush, Earthquake, Flamethrower, Giga Impact

Advice: Let me start by saying congrats on getting this far, but this 
will be a little more difficult than advertised. Spiritomb is one of 
two Pokemon that doesn’t have a single weakness and has a good amount 
of immunities so hit him hard with a special attack. You should know 
how to take down Roserade by dealing with your rival this whole time. 
Togekiss is the replacement of Diamond and Pearl’s Gastrodon, it’s weak 
against Electric and Rock type moves. Apparently Lucario is all the 
rage with female trainers. Lucario is weak against Fire and Ground 
moves. Milotic has a weakness for Grass and Electric moves but be 
careful of Mirror Coat because it’s dangerous when you use a special 
attack on her. Lastly, we have the big dragon himself, Garchomp. 
Garchomp will mage a massacre out of your Pokemon easily. Use an Ice 
move and it will spell disaster for Garchomp.

There you go, you have officially beaten Pokemon Platinum, now enjoy 
the credits.

13: Second Run
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you defeated the Elite Four, here’s a chance to have a rematch 
with the Gyms and Elites, stronger than before. I won’t give advice on 
this for one reason: This is totally optional and you don’t have to 
fight them again, but it’s good training so this is all on you. Alright 
lets get started.

14. Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s the end of my Walkthrough; I thank you for choosing mine. I like 
to thank Psypoke’s website the most for most of the information on 
there that I put on here.
