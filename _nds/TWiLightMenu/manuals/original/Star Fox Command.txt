Version 0.1: Submitted August 31, 2006- First version of the guide,
Introduction, Controls, General Tips and Strategies, Training Missions and 
First Playthrough finished. Character section and Enemy section started

Version 0.25: Submitted September 1, 2006- Added some enemies, bosses, FAQs,
credits, endings 2 and 3. Fixed the bottom of my maps. Apparantly GameFAQs 
doesn't use Unicode, so my overscores came out as question marks. Fixed a 
couple of minor erors throughout the guide. Added ASCII banner to the top. 
Cleaned up enemy section by arranging them in alphabetical order. Added sites
with permission to host the guide

Version 0.4: Submitted September 6, 2006- Some more enemies, bosses and pilots
added. Ending #4 also added. I realized that I forgot to put the multiplayer
guide in the last version so I added it here. More polishing.


================================2. Introduction===============================

Years ago, a scientist named Dr. Andross became obsessed with controlling the
Lylat system. He launched wave after wave of attack fighters from the remote 
planet of Venom and ordered them to strike Planet Corneria -- the heart of the 
Lylat system.

However, four brave pilots who made up a squadron known as Star Fox finally put
an end to the doctor's mad ambitions. Andross himself was defeated by the
leader of Star Fox, a brilliant pilot named Fox McCloud.

In the time that followed, Venom became known as a quarantine planet. Due to
that reputation -- and the frequent patrols carried out by members of the 
Cornerian military -- it has been years since anyone set foot on the planet's 
surface.

But after a period of quiet, Venom struck back with devastating attacks on the 
Lylat system. Any and all attempts at resistance were brushed aside, and soon
all cities came under the grip of this new, terrifying enemy.

The occupiers were known as the Anglars, and operated under the control of the
Anglar Emperor. Their headquarters were located in the toxic Venom Sea, a vast
ocean so inhospitable that it was believed no living thing could survive there.

The members of Star Fox, the heroic and famous squadron that had come to Lylat's
aid in her hour of need, had disbanded. Each pilot was living a new life, and it
would prove a difficult task to bring the former team members back together.

Fox McCloud, the team's leader was wandering the galaxy with his friend ROB, a
navigation robot that he inherited after his father's passing. Fox used this
time to tie up a few loose ends and also ponder the course his life had taken.

The Cornerian military hero General Pepper fell ill, and could no longer lead as
he once did. He recommended that Peppy Hare, Star Fox team member and father
figure to Fox, be promoted and given command of all Cornerian forces.

Brash pilot Falco Lombardi lived as a loner. He drifted from job to job,
searching for the same thrill he felt as a member of Star Fox. But his 
existence was mostly an empty one... something that annoyed him more than he 
would admit.

The technical brains behind the team, and Fox's closest friend, was the good
natured Slippy Toad. Slippy met and fell in love with a girl named Amanda, and
decided to leave the world of flying and start a new life with his beloved 
fiancee.

Star Wolf, the true rivals of Star Fox, continued to be involved in dirty 
dealings. Their work soon caught the attention of the Cornerian military, who 
put a massive bounty on their heads.

And finally, Krystal. The lone female of the group, she had fought beside Fox
and fell in love with him -- much against her better judgement and professional
concern. Her love was returned, however, and the two promised to remain together
always.

But Fox was quite wary of the danger that haunted pilots in the elite Star Fox
squadron, and he eventually forced Krystal to leave the team. Heartbroken and
ashamed, she fled from Fox and vanished soon after. No one knows what became of
her...

Now, the past has come to haunt them all. Unwilling or unable to face his former
team, Fox has chosen to take on the entire Anglar armada by himself. Can he do
it? Will the team put aside their differences and reunite? All Lylat waits for
the answers...

=========================4. General Tips and Strategies=========================

Basics:

Battles are divided into 2 parts, strategy on Map Mode, and dogfighting in
battle mode. During each "turn", you are given the ability to move each of your
fighters a certain distance on the map, with the object being to intercept
enemy fighters and missiles before hitting Great Fox, and to reclaim allied
bases from enemy Motherships. After moves have been made by you and the
computer, any encounters will be listed and you can choose the order in which to
fight them.

On the map, you can see bases and enemy icons. Your squadron is represented by
small versions of their ships and typically start near the Great Fox. Enemy
ships are represented by small red dots. Red boxed areas represent impassable
terrain which can't be flown over, but missiles may be shot over them. You will
see small arrows next to enemy blips, representing their speed. One < is a
slower enemy that won't move as far per turn. Two << are faster enemies that can
move a fair distance in one turn. Three <<< are very fast enemies that you
should watch for.

Enemy missiles are represented by large red missiles, which have a dotted line
in the path of their trajectory. When strategy choices are made and entered, the
missile will end up at the end of that dotted line unless you intercept it along
it's path. Missiles will be launched occasionally from enemy missile launchers.

Enemy Motherships have attacked and occupied many allied bases. They can either
produce new units, or launch missiles at Great Fox. Taking these bases gives you
additional turns to accomplish the mission with. Enemy controlled bases are
shown with red pyramids, and friendly, unoccupied bases are shown with blue
pyramids.

Powerups are littered across the map. Circles made up of triangles pointing
inward are Supply items. They recharge your shields. Yellow missiles allow you
to stock Great Fox with missiles which allow you to wipe out a group of enemy 
fighters without having to dogfight them. 

The other part is battle mode, which is the result of an encounter. In this 
mode, you fly your ship around a small area which has enemy units all around.
There are also missile encounters, which have you fly through a series of 
beacons to destroy an enemy missile before it hits Great Fox.

You will have a timer which represents the fuel used when dogfighting. As you
encounter more enemies and spend more time dogfighting, you lose fuel. If you
run out of fuel, you lose a fighter. Killing 5 enemies or flying through rings
while in battle help replenish your fuel and there are often fuel powerups on
the map screen


Defeating Enemy Motherships:

First, you must clear the area of core enemies. These are shown on the screen
before you enter the engagement. Watch out for the beam shot from the
Mothership, as it can cause quite a bit of damage.

After defeating core enemies and acquiring their cores, ROB will message you 
saying that you must fly through the beacons and execute a roll to destroy the 
Mothership. Make sure to fly through each of the red boxes and perform a barrel
roll before hitting the Mothership. I find it easier to roll at the beginning
of the sequence, because rolling here doesn't deplete your boost gauge, and the
first few beacons are easier to fly through.

Flying through the crosshairs of the red squares gives you 1 extra second to 
your timer for each beacon.


Destroying Enemy Missiles:

To catch the fast moving missiles, you need to follow in the missile's "slip
stream", the area of space where the missile has passed through, in order to
catch it. Fly through the red squares until you are within range of the missile.

Once in range, either lock-on until the bracket turns into a diamond, or fire
away if your ship has no lock-on feature. Be careful to continue flying through
the red boxes as you shoot the missile down. Hurry up though, because each red
box increases your speed, and soon it will be nearly impossible to hit each box.

If you fail to catch the missile, it gets an extra boost of distance to the
Great Fox, so be careful not to lose track of it.



===============================5. Character Guide===============================

This section is incomplete right now

This game took a step away from the previous Star Fox games by letting you fly
as many different characters. Their profiles can be viewed in-game after you fly
a mission using that character and complete the game with any ending after that
mission.


-----------------------------------Fox McCloud----------------------------------

"The leader of the Star Fox squadron. His bravery and sense of justice is 
strong, although he can be too serious at times.

Ship: Arwing II
Laser: Single
Lock: Single
Bomb: 2
Shield: 6 squares
Boost: 4 squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

Fox McCloud is the main character of the Star Fox series. He made his debut on
the SNES in 1993 and has starred in 3 other Star Fox games (64, Adventure and
Assault) as well as being a fighter in both Super Smash Bros. games.

He was orphaned as a teenager when his father, James McCloud died fighting the
forces of the evil Andross with Pigma Dengar and Peppy Hare as the original Star
Fox team. Pigma betrayed James and Peppy, but Peppy managed to escape and took
care of Fox. After that, Fox took the reigns of the Star Fox team by recruiting
Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. They took on and defeated Andross' forces in
the original Star Fox.

Star Fox 64 was a remake of the original game which helped expand on the story
and include the rival squadron Star Wolf.

Fox's GameCube debut took place 8 years after the events of Star Fox 64. After
4 years an incident on Titania saw Andross reincarnated and Falco left the 
group. 4 years after that, the events of Star Fox Adventure took place, with
Fox and company saving the planet Sauria from Andross' evil scheme. Krystal
joined the team, and Falco came back during these events and the group was
once again a force to be reckoned with

Shortly after, Andrew Oikonny rounded up the remainder of Andross' army in a
last ditch effort to conquer Lylat, starting off the second GameCube title
Star Fox Assault. Fox would soon discover that Oikonny was the least of their
troubles after discovering a new alien threat that had the potential to
destroy civilization entirely! Star Fox eventually defeated the Aparoid queen
with the help of Star Wolf, but payed the price of losing their flagship, the
Great Fox.

In the years following the Aparoid invasion, the Star Fox team gradually
started to break up, with Falco heading off on his own again, Peppy
replacing General Pepper as leader of the Cornerian army, Slippy finding
a soul mate in Amanda and Krystal being kicked out of the group by Fox to
keep her away from the dangers of the job. This is where we begin Command.

Fox's ship is a good choice as it is versatile. It is a very average ship, which
means that it can be used effectively for a variety of tasks. His single laser
is pretty weak, so charged shots are the way to go. He has pretty decent shields
and a large boost gauge. He can also hold 2 bombs. Fox is suited best to fast
enemies, and enemies that shoot alot of lasers and require alot of rolling.

-----------------------------------Slippy Toad----------------------------------

"A member of the Star Fox team, and Fox's close friend. Known for his brains
rather than his flying, he develops most of the team's weapons."

Ship: Bullfrog
Laser: Dual Plasma
Lock: N/A
Bomb: 3
Shield: 8 squares
Boost: 2 squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

Slippy is a veteran of the Star Fox team, and has been in it since Fox took 
over. He isn't the greatest pilot, but is good in a scrap. His main
contribution to the team has been his technical skills. He functions as the
team's mechanic and weapons developer. He designed the Landmaster tank and the
Blue Marine submarine.

He is a loyal friend to Fox, and always willing to help out. Sometimes his
eagerness to please gets him in trouble, but his friends are always there to
bail him out. He recently fell in love with Amanda, and is planning to marry 
her.

Slippy's ship is a powerful, but slow ship that can take a beating, but can't
get away from one. His plasma guns more than make up for his lack of laser as
they really pack a punch. He also has a capacity for 3 bombs, which makes him an
ideal choice against slow-moving enemies or bosses. Be careful of his low boost
bar, as it means that you only have a limited barrel roll.


---------------------------------Falco Lombardi---------------------------------

"A member of Star Fox. He's brash and headstrong, but his peerless piloting
makes him irreplaceable"

Ship: Sky Claw
Laser: Single
Lock: Multi
Bomb: 1
Shield: 4 squares
Boost: 4 squares
Time Bonus: 3 seconds

Falco has been in Star Fox since Fox took over the group, and has been a key
asset to the group since then. His piloting skills are on par with Fox's, but
his brash, headstrong nature make him a bit of a liability. He has been in all
of the Star Fox games, and also made an appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee.

Falco's ship is best suited to taking out groups of enemies. It's multi-lock
makes up for the lack of bombs and firepower, and can make short work out of
swarming enemies. His boost also makes him a good choice against nimble enemies.


-------------------------------------Krystal------------------------------------

"A former member of Star Fox. She's strong and kind, but at times too stubborn
for her own good."

Ship: Cloud Runner
Laser: Twin
Lock: Single
Bomb: 1
Shield: 6 squares
Boost: 3 squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

Krystal made her first appearance in Star Fox Adventures as a powerful yet kind
telepath who wanted to help the dinosaurs living on Sauria. She met Fox and soon
fell in love with him. She replaced Peppy as the fourth pilot in Star Fox
Assault and worked with the group for some time, before Fox forced her to quit
in order to keep her out of harms way. Krystal felt hurt and angry by this and
disappeared. She has a friendship with Lucy, and has Panther of Star Wolf
vying for her affections whenever they meet.

Krystal's ship is a good multi-purpose fighter, with average stats. Her twin
lasers and single lock allow her to take out a variety of enemy ships and her
above average shield can help her get through these encounters.


-----------------------------------Lucy Hare------------------------------------

"Only daughter of peppy Hare. She doted on her father and longed to be a pilot.
Currently teaches astrophysics on Fichina."

Ship: Sky Bunny
Laser: Dual Plasma
Lock: Single
Bomb: 1
Shield: 4 squares
Boost: 3 squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

Lucy makes her Star Fox debut here. She is the daughter of original Star Fox
member Peppy Hare. Her mother died when she was young, and she longed to follow
in her father's footsteps. When she grew older, she gave up that dream and began
teaching astrophysics on the planet Fichina. She is friends with Krystal.

The Sky Bunny is probably my favourite ship. It has the Bullfrog's strongest
asset, Plasma guns, but avoids the Bullfrog's greatest weaknesses by including
a single lock and better boosts. It only has 1 bomb though, so you need to use
bombs wisely with her.


-------------------------------------Amanda-------------------------------------

"Slippy's girlfriend. The met two years ago, and she fell in love with Slippy at
first sight. Or so the story goes..."

Ship: Tadpole
Laser: Single
Lock: Multi
Bomb: 1
Shield: 6 squares
Boost: 2 Squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

This is Amanda's first appearance. She met Star Fox member Slippy Toad and fell
in love with him shortly after. Right now they are engaged and planning to get
married soon.

The Tadpole is similar to Falco's ship, except trading low shields and high
boost for higher shields and low boost. It is best used against enemies that
attack in groups.


----------------------------------Katt Monroe-----------------------------------

"A former colleague of Falco, she's still smitten with him. Katt secretly wants
to join Star Fox so she can be near him."

Ship: Cat's Paw 2
Lock: Single
Bomb: 2
Shield: 4 squares
Boost: 3 squares
Time Bonus: 2 seconds

Katt made her debut in Star Fox 64, helping out the team in a couple of crucial
missions. She's known Falco for a long time and seems to follow him around. Katt
was responsible for finding out about the project designed to reincarnate 
Andross and contacted Falco for assistance 4 years after the events of Star Fox
64. She's resourceful and playful with Falco, constantly toying with him and
teasing him.

The Cat's Paw 2 is nowhere near as sleak as the original, but still performs
nicely. The stats are for the most part, extremely average, making it one of the
most balanced fighters in the game. Having 2 bombs is nice. Her curve shots are
unique in that they home slightly when fired at an enemy. This makes her a good
choice against fast moving enemies that like to evade.


----------------------------------Peppy Hare------------------------------------

"A general in the Cornerian forces. He's a former member of Star Fox and father
figure to Fox. He was great friends with Fox's father."

Ship: Arwing
Laser: Twin
Lock: Single
Bomb: 2
Shield: 6 squares
Boost: 4 squares
Time bonus: 3 seconds

Peppy is one of the original members of Star Fox. He and James McCloud were best
friends. When Pigma betrayed them, Peppy escaped Andross' wrath to return to
Corneria and take care of James' son Fox. Peppy was a mentor to Fox as he grew
up, and joined the new Star Fox in order to continue teaching Fox how to be a
great pilot.

Peppy was an extremely skilled and valuable member of the team during the Lylat
wars. He was the experienced member of the group and would always offer advice
to the other pilots. After the Lylat wars, he retired as a pilot in order to
take a tactical role aboard Great Fox for the team. During the Aparoid invasion,
Peppy saved General Pepper after his infested ship was shot down by Fox and was
about to crash land. Peppy then played a key role in the destruction of the
Aparoid queen by crashing the Great Fox into the force field protecting the
queen as it was about to close, destroying the original Great Fox. He survived
the crash and escaped with ROB in one of Great Fox's escape pods.

Peppy's Arwing is very similar to Fox's, but it features twin lasers all the
time and a 3 second time bonus instead of 2. The twin lasers all Peppy to do 
more damage against heavy enemies than Fox.


-----------------------------------Bill Grey------------------------------------

"A pilot who plays a vital role in the Cornerian forces. A childhood friendship
with Fox led Bill to also become a pilot."

Ship: Cornerian Fighter
Laser: Twin
Lock: N/A
Bomb: 2
Shield: 6 squares
Boost: 3 squares
Time Bonus: 3 seconds

Bill also made his debut in Star Fox 64 as the leader of the Cornerian army 
group based on the planet Katina. Fox and his crew helped Bill fight off an
invasion from Venom and Bill repayed the favour by helping Fox in other missions
against Andross. Bill is an ace pilot and natural leader who always pays back
his debts and is more than willing to help out a friend in need.

The Cornerian Fighter is actually pretty crappy. Like the Bullfrog, it can't
lock on, but unlike the Bullfrog, it doesn't have enough firepower to be really
effective. His higher shielding makes up for this though. My advice would be to
try and get behind an enemy and just plug away with the twin lasers.


===================================6. Enemies===================================

The enemy list is incomplete right now.

Below are the given stats, and a quick synopsis on all of the core enemies found
through the game


Ammonite I- Weapon [][][]
            Shield [][][][][][][][]

These guys are like flying shrimp of some kind. They fly around aimlessly until
you get close, then they open up their shells and shoot lasers at you. Watch
your boost meter as you're barrel rolling, and be ready to pull away when it's
about to run out.


Angel Fish- Weapon [][][][]
            Shield [][][]

These guys fly in groups of 3. Try to get in behind them and let loose with 
lasers. Otherwise, they are easy prey for bombs. They shoot lasers in any 
direction.


Assault Laser- Weapon [][]
               Shield [][][][][][][][]

These guys can be a pain as well. Their attacks consist of throwing about 6
bombs in the air that creat a pillar of fire, much like the Bomber Birds. Watch
out for these pillars and avoid as necessary


Balloonist- Weapon [][][][]
            Shield [][][][][][][][]

Basically a box being supported by several balloons. Have someone with 
multilock tear through this enemy by targetting all the balloons. Alternatively
just fire away at the ballons


Bee Fighter- Weapon[][][][]
             Shield[][][][][][][][]

This version of the Bee Fighter launches a large ring of energy towards you.
Fly through the middle of the ring to avoid damage.


Bee Fighter II- Weapon [][][]
                Shield [][][][][][][][]

This thing will fly backwards as you approach it, and when it lifts up its 
stinger, you know it's going to attack. Attack the stinger to kill it, and
when the stinger is pointed at you, do a barrel roll.


Bomber Bird- Weapon [][][]
             Shield [][][][]

Bomber Birds will carry beneath them, 2 orbs, which create large towers of fire
when dropped. If you're behind a Bomber Bird, expect them to drop these orbs
and avoid them when you see the orbs dropped. After they drop their payload,
they will always turn left. Use this to your advantage and take them out.


Bozoid- Weapon [][][][]
        Shield [][][][][][][][]

Stronger version of the Assault Laser, use the same tactics.


Commander- Weapon [][]
           Shield [][]

The Commanders are a little bit more difficult than the Swarm Fighters, mainly
because they are stronger, and aren't grouped closely together. The best trick
is to get behind one and let loose with charged shots while avoiding fire from
the rest of them.


Devil Shark- Weapon [][][][]
             Shield [][][][][][][][]

Devil Worm- Weapon [][]
            Shield [][][][][][][][]

Just blast away at the head while avoiding it's shots and being careful not to
crash into the tail.


Elite Fighter- Weapon [][]
               Shield [][][]
Elite Fighters can shoot in any direction, but are pushovers. Just lock on and
fire when fully charged.


Fire Wheel- Weapon [][][]
            Shield [][][][][][][][]

Fire Wheels will open up when approached, then fly in front of you while turning
3 lines of fireballs and bouncing up and down. Then they will close and try to
crash into you. They have alot of health, so fully charged shots are your best
bet.


Flash Bomber- Weapon [][][][][]
              Shield [][][][][][][]

These guys are slow, and their only attack is dropping 3 mines as you're chasing
them. Just lock on to them from a distance and you can destroy them before they
even have a chance to drop the mines.


Flip Bots- Weapon [][][]
           Shield [][][]

Pretty basic enemy, beasically a Commander that can perform loops. If you're
chasing one and it pulls a loop, either brake or loop to stay on its tail.


Giant Spindly Fish- Weapon [][][][]
                    Shield [][][][][][][][]

These guys are a major pain, and I suggest missiling them if you can. They have
6 fins which shoot lasers at you, 3 on top and 3 on the bottom. It takes 2 bombs
to kill 1 of them, and charge shots don't work. If you can, try to take Slippy
against these guys or someone else with powerful single shots. Barrel roll alot.


Invader III- Weapon [][][][]
             Shield [][][]

These guys fly around in groups of 5. They shoot lasers in all directions. Try
to use charge shots from a distance against these guys, or use a bomb if need
be.


Jellyfish- Weapon [][][]
           Shield [][][][]

The Jellyfish are relatively easy to beat. They come in large groups of 5, and
stay together making them easy targets. They shoot lasers at you from any
direction so don't forget to barrel roll.


King Dodora- Weapon [][][][]
             Shield [][][][][]

Same as the regular Dodora, except stronger. Will also cause stone pillars to
rise out of the sand if you are chasing it.


Mega Spindly Fish- Weapon [][][][][]
                   Shield [][][][][][][][]

Similar to the Giant Spindly Fish, but stronger. I recommend you missile them
whenever humanly possible. If you are forced to fight, I reccomend attacking
the fins on its top and bottom from the side.


Moras- Weapon [][][][]
       Shield [][][][][]

Node- Weapon [][][]
      Shield [][][][][][][]

An orb that flies around with a trail of tiny orbs behind it. Drop a bomb on
this sucker and watch the screen fill up with powerups from the little things.
Then just attack the head with lasers while avoiding it's ring lasers.


Puffer- Weapon [][]
        Shield [][][]

These guys are pretty weak. They like to fly around in swarms and shoot lasers
at you. Blast away with lasers, multi-lock or bombs to dispatch them quickly.


Pylon- Weapon [][]
       Shield [][]

You may remember these guys from the original Star Fox. The trick here is to
take out one of the three parts at a time. This is best done by using charged
shots.


Shuriken- Weapon []
          Shield [][][][][][][]

Don't let the lack of firepower fool you, these guys can be a pain. Watch out
for their rear-mounted lasers and barrel roll when needed


Spin Devil- Weapon [][][][][][]
            Shield [][][][][][][]

Stationary enemy that shoots a series of beams out of it's 8 parts. 2 bombs will
take it out. Otherwise, use someone with multi-lock, or just pound away at them.


Spinning Cores- Weapon [][][]
                Shield [][][][][][][][]


Starfish- Weapon [][]
          Shield []

The Starfish enemies are pretty easy to take out. Lock on, and wait for them to
open up their tentacles, then release your charged shot to finish them off.


Swarm Fighter- Weapon [][]
               Shield []

These guys tend to fly in groups, making them easy targets for a barrage of
lasers or charged shots. They have one laser cannon on the front and a
relatively slow speed.


Todora- Weapon [][][]
        Shield [][][][][][][][]


Web Ship- Weapon [][][]
          Shield [][][][][][][][]

Web Ships only have one attack, and that is to create a trail of plasma behind
them as they move. Just be careful to avoid flying directly behind them and you
should be fine


Web Ship II- Weapon [][][][][][][]
             Shield [][][][][][][][]

Just like the Web Ship 1, except it can move up and down making it a tougher
target. Attack from the side for best results.


=================================7. Boss Guide==================================

This section is currently incomplete

Arrow Head (Asteroid Belt):

- Choose a pilot that has the most bombs and shields
- Drop the bombs onto the Arrow Head to easily take out the tail parts
- Now just pound the crap out of the head while dodging the attacks to win.


Arrow Head (Venom):

- Little bit harder this time
- Will fly into the tubes on the ceiling and floor occasionally
- Attack the pieces of the snake between the head and tail
- Destroyed pieces will fall to the ground and start shoot at you
- Once all middle pieces are destroyed, the head will attract them around
it. Just fire away at the head while dodging the attacks
- For an easier time, use a bomb on it as it is entering/leaving a tube


Death Crab:

- Choose whoever has the most health/bombs
- In The first part of the battle, the crab is on the ground. Drop all of your 
remaining bombs and shoot the pincers
- Next, the crab starts flying. Now you must take out its legs and pincers
- Avoid his ring lasers by either dodging or barrel rolling
- He also has an attack similar to the Assault Laser, where he launches several
bombs in the air that create towers of fire that do heavy damage
- After all the legs and pincers are shot off, attack the crab's face for 
massive damage until he goes down


Emperor Anglar:

- Anglar is protected by a forcefield generated by 3 orbs
- His attack is a stream of shots that can be easily deflected
- Shoot the orbs until they turn grey
- Anglar will charge up a shot and you need to roll and reflect this
shot back to him
- After the reflected shot hits him, his antenna will turn red. Get
as many shots on it as you can
- When at half his life, he will swim offscreen, leaving the orbs
to be destroyed. During this phase, large solid beams will fly in from
every direction
- After the 3 orbs are destroyed, Anglar returns to the screen and
uses some attacks he seems to have learned from Andross
- First he will suck in air. Use your brakes to avoid being eaten
- After he sucks in, he will blow out debris that can be deflected with
your roll
- During this time, just pound away at his head until he dies


Grunner:

- Pick whoever has the most health and has a charger on their lasers
- Grunner itself has no attacks. Rather, he calls up a pair of pillars that
shoot rocks at you and create an electrical barrier between them
- The best method is to have someone with a charge ability fly behind Gunner
and above the range of the stone towers' electrical barriers.
- You can only hurt him from behind


Pigma Dengar:

- He can be a confusing boss at first
- He is composed of 4 cubes and a central orb protected by the cubes
- Each time you shoot one of the cubes, the face changes
- The pattern goes Red-Yellow-Green-Pigma
- The object is to make all 4 squares compose Pigma's face to reveal the orb
- The Red face launches multiple pillars of flames
- The Green face launches 3 volleys of 6 missiles. Shoot them down or boost away
- The Yellow face shoots a barrage of fireballs
- When all 4 are Pigma's face, the cubes move away and reveal the orb, but not
before a laser image of Pigma's face is launched at you. Shoot the orb while
avoiding the laser-face
- Lather, rinse, repeat


Splitter:

- Choose whoever has the most health
- This boss has 3 sections
- You need to kill the sections one at a time
- It has a beam similar to that on Motherships that will attack below it
- It launches a barrage of slow moving shots periodically
- Get behind it and shoot the flashing part on the rear piece while barrel
rolling to deflect the shots
- Repeat for the other 2 parts
- Use charged shots unless you are using Lucy

Star Wolf:

- Choose someone with alot of health and preferably someone who can charge
- Try to focus on one enemy at a time
- If you see an oppurtunity to use a bomb, take it
- Watch out for the mines they drop
- Shoot the mines to get additional fuel if needed
- If you have one on your tail, loop or barrel roll
- Keep one eye on the radar to prevent one of them from getting behind you


===============================8. Multiplayer Guide=============================


Here are some tips to help you climb the ranks of Nintendo's Wi-Fi ladder:

- Items are a good thing. In any 3 or 4 person game, try to grab items as they
appear. Plasma guns should be your first priority.
- Never go head to head with someone that has plasma guns. Similarly, if you 
have them and a decent amount of health, feel free to go head to head.
- Cloaking is an excellent way to sit back and watch as other people kill each-
other, then swoop in for the star
- Bombs have a large number counting down above them and create a loud noise
when dropped, but can be an excellent tool against dogfighting enemies that may
be too occupied to notice
- Remember, in multiplayer games, your own bombs will hurt you if you are in
range
- Keep track of the messages ROB gives you. They will tell you who picks up what
items, who gets kills, and who is in the lead. Try to target the person in the
lead to prevent them from scoring.
- Don't waste your boost meter by rushing towards an enemy. Save at least half
your meter for rolling at all times.
- Don't kill someone unless you are sure that you will get the star.
- Only loop and u-turn when you are as high as you can fly. This makes you a
more difficult target as you perform the manouver.


==================================9. Walkthrough================================

Each mission in my walkthrough is broken into 3 parts. The first part is a
detailed map which describes enemy locations, powerup locations and natural
obstacles. Here is a legend for the various symbols used in my maps:

Great Fox- Represents the starting location of the Great Fox

(Character Name)- Represents the starting location of the specified character

E (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents a group of enemy craft that are detailed on the
outside of the map

EB (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents an enemy controlled base that will produce new
enemy ships if left in enemy hands. Reclaim these to recieve additional turns.
Every time you finish a mission with extra turns, they are added to a counter.
After 5 extra turns, you recieve an extra ship (1-up).

RL (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents an enemy controlled base that will launch rockets
at the Great Fox. They operate the same way as enemy bases do.

C (1, 2, 3 etc.)- C represents friendly bases. While moving on the map, you can
fly over these cities, and gain a large distance bonus to continue your flight
path. These can be extremely important in some missions

EM (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents enemy missiles that are on the map at mission 
start. Additional missiles created during the missions are unlabelled due to the
randomness of their appearance

S (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Show the location of Supply power-ups, which replenishes the
shields of whoever picks them up

F (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents the location of Fuel-Cell power-ups, which add +25
to your timer when picked up

M (1, 2, 3 etc.)- Represents the location of Missile power-ups, which add 1 
missile to the Great Fox's arsenal. A maximum of 3 missiles can be held at once

. - Areas covered in .'s represent places on the map that are shrouded by the 
fog of war. You cannot see enemies or powerups that are surrounded by this fog 
unless you uncover them using your Fog Dispersal Device or have one of your
characters move through the fog.

+ - Areas with + signs represent Asteroid fields. These fields hinder your
movement on the map by severly decreasing your distance as you pass through 
them. Try to avoid getting stuck in an asteroid field and leaving the Great Fox
open to enemy attacks

= - Areas covered by = signs are "No-fly zones", areas where enemy or friendly
ships cannot pass through. Missiles can pass over these zones, so watch out.
You will have to fly around these zones

The second part is a turn by turn walkthrough of the mission, which will give
you a rough idea of how to succeed. Keep in mind that there are some variables,
such as enemy ship and missile launches from occupied bases, that may make your
mission play out differently than mine did. This is just meant as a guide and
won't be 100% accurate every time.

The third part is a brief synopsis of how to successfully complete the combat
portions of each mission.


=========================9.1) Ending 1 (Default Path)===========================

You start the game by reading the Prologue, which gives you an idea of the 
current state of the Lylat system, and Team Star Fox's former members.

Fox decides to help out the citizens of Lylat by taking out the Anglar threat by
himself. ROB sets course for Corneria, but asks Fox if he wants to do some
training first. I recommend you accept the training offer as the controls can be
quite awkward at first.


=====================9.i) Level 1: Controlling the Fighter======================

Just fly through the rings in any order to complete this mission. It helps give
you a feel for the stylus controls of the game.


=======================9.ii) Level 2: Combat Techniques=========================

Thirty weak fighters occupy this stage. They tend to group together making them
easy targets. Take this oppurtunity to get used to firing controls, charge shots
and bomb usage. Don't forget the ever mighty barrel roll.


=========================9.iii) Level 3: Barrel Rolls===========================

Here you have 5 turret towers scattered across the map. This level teaches you
how to attack stationary targets, and the importance of the barrel roll. As you
approach the enemy turrets, barrel roll to deflect their shots and attract
their cores. Just open up with your lasers to destroy them. If you want, you
can use your 2 bombs to destroy the turrets from a very safe distance. It will
help you to learn bomb usage. I also recommend that you play around learning the
advanced flight manouvers such as boosting, braking u-turning and looping.


========================9.iv) Level 4: The Time System==========================

This level teaches you the basics of the time system by pitting you against 15
weak fighters with only a certain time limit. Here you will learn tricks to
increase your fuel for other encounters, such as flying through loops for
bonuses or getting a bonus for every 5 enemies killed.

TRAINING COMPLETE!

After training, ROB states that you have arrived at Corneria and are ready to
take the fight to the Anglar forces


=====================9.11) Mission 1: The Adventure Begins!=====================

Planet: Corneria
Characters: Fox

Your first combat mission is a fairly simple one, designed to give you a feel
for the controls and command system.

Turn 1:

- Fly towards E3
- All 3 enemy groups will fly towards Great Fox

Turn 2: 

- Fly Northwest
- E3 and E2 will engage Fox

Turn 3:

- Fly towards E1 and engage

Combat tips:

- This level is easy as there are no secondary enemies
- Against the Swarm Fighters, just charge up and release on approach and finish
off the remainder
- Against the Commanders, try to get behind them and fire off charged shots.
Barrel roll if necessary.
- Remember to barrel roll after killing enemies to attract powerups and cores

MISSION COMPLETE!

Back aboard the Great Fox, you discover that the Anglar ships are made of chrome
and aluminum, perfectly designed to function in the acidic Sea of Venom. Fox
decides that he needs help, so he contacts Slippy. After some catching up,
Slippy decides to help Fox out.


=======================9.12) Mission 2: Reunion With Slippy=====================

Planet: Corneria
Characters: Fox, Slippy (arrives during turn 3)

This mission has you starting off with impassable terrain between you and Great
Fox. Enemy ships will beat you to the Great Fox, unless the Great Fox fights 
back. This mission teaches you how to use missile powerups to your advantage.

Turn 1:

- Have Fox move to M2 by going through M1
- All enemies will close in on Great Fox

Turn 2:

- Launch missiles at E4 and E5
- Move Fox to M4 going through M3 and F1
- Remaining enemies will move towards Great Fox

Turn 3:

- Launch missiles at E3 and E2
- Slippy joins the fray. Have him engage the last group of enemies

Combat Tips:

- You should only have to fight once here, and it's just a group of 6 Swarm
Fighters
- Slippy's lasers can't charge, but pack more of a punch than Fox's
 
MISSION COMPLETE!

After clearing Mission 2, you learn from Slippy that our old pal Peppy Hare has
been named as General of the Cornerian army, replacing General Pepper who is
confined to a sick bed. ROB interrupts saying that an emergency message has
been sent by someone named Lucy, who Slippy explains is Peppy's daughter. You
set course for the planet Fichina to help Lucy out.

When you arrive at Fachina, you learn a little bit about Lucy, including how she
was a tomboy as a child and is now teaching astrophysics. You also learn that
she was good friends with Krystal before Fox cuts the conversation short.


=========================9.13) Mission 3- Fog of War============================

Planet: Fichina
Characters: Fox, Slippy

In this mission, you are introduced to the "Fog of War", which is a cloud of 
fog that obscures your radar and hides enemies and powerups.

Turn 3:

- Launch your missile at E1
- Uncover the base
- Send Fox straight for the enemy base
- Fox will engage E4, then fight the Mothership

Combat advice:

- This map features many different extra enemies, including those barrier
creating enemies, boats with a laser mounted, laser turrets and these weird 
bubble shooting octopi
- As usual, focus mainly on eliminating the enemies with the cores in them
- Against the Shurikens, watch out for their rear laser and barrel roll as
needed
- Against the Bomber Birds, just watch out for the column of fire as they drop
their bombs. Try to keep a bit of distance and use charged lasers
- Against the Assault Laser, watch out for the columns of fire as they launch
their scatter bombs. Once again try to keep a distance
- In the engagement with the Mothership, destroy the Shurikens protecting it,
get their cores, then follow the red boxes to the Mothership and execute a quick
Barrel Roll as you are about to hit it. That is how to defeat the boss.


BOSS! Star Wolf:

After you clear the level, Star Wolf and his gang will arrive. They think you're
after the hefty bounty on their heads and will engage you. Choose one person to
fight Star Wolf with. Pick whoever has more shield.

Star Wolf advice:

- Try to focus on one enemy at a time
- If you see an oppurtunity to use a bomb, take it
- Watch out for the mines they drop
- If you have one on your tail, loop or barrel roll
- If you are running out of fuel, shoot some of the mines for additional
powerups

After battle, Lucy boards Great Fox and asks whether Peppy got her message or 
not. Fox explains that they intercepted the message and Slippy reassures her 
that Peppy will not go down so easily. Lucy then tells Fox that she knows who's
responsible for the invasion of Fichina: Andrew Oikonny, former member of Star
Wolf and nephew of the late Andross. You then find out that Oikonny is working
on a dangerous super weapon.

Slippy suggests that you visit his father in the asteroid field.

Choose option 1 to fight Oikonny now. Option 2 is locked.


=====================9.14) Mission 4- Oikonny Strikes Back!=====================

Planet: Fichina
Characters: Fox, Slippy and Lucy

Oikonny messages you saying that he's ready to exact his revenge for all the
times you've foiled him in the past. Fox taunts Oikonny and Oikonny cuts the
transmission.

BOSS! Death Crab:

Oikonny decides to finally fight his own battle, and comes out with the Anglar 
superweapon, the Death Crab. Don't be too scared though, this boss isn't so 
tough.

- Choose whoever has the most health/bombs
- the first part of the battle, the crab is on the ground. Drop all of your 
remaining bombs and shoot the pincers
- Next, the crab starts flying. Now you must take out its legs and pincers
- Avoid his ring lasers by either dodging or barrel rolling
- After all the legs and pincers are shot off, attack the crab's face for 
MASSIVE DAMAGE!

After Oikonny is defeated, you return to Great Fox to celebrate the liberation 
of Fachina. Slippy compliments Lucy's flying and Lucy chides Fox for "Really
screwing up" with Krystal. Lucy then leaves to find her father on Corneria.

Slippy asks Fox to visit the ocean planet Aquas so he can pick up his fiancee.
ROB then gets a message saying that the sunken city on Aquas is under attack. 
Fox sends out a message to Falco Lombardi to meet them at Aquas. You leave for
Aquas.

When you arrive at Aquas, Slippy tries to contact Amanda but fails. He begins
to worry until Falco arrives and teases him. Faclo says he has interesting
information but they decide to clear the area first.


=======================9.15) Mission 5- Beneath the Waves=======================

Planet: Aquas
Characters: Fox, Slippy, Falco, Amanda (comes during turn 2)

This mission introduces you to enemy rockets. You have to intercept them before
they can reach Great Fox.

|____________________________________________|

Turn 1: 

- Uncover RL1, RL2, E2 and M1
- Move Falco towards the missile upgrade
- Have Fox intercept E2
- Move Slippy towards the City
- EM1 will move closer to Great Fox
- E2 will engage Fox
- E1 will move towards Great Fox
- If you have a missile from last mission, I suggest using it on E2, as the
Giant Spindly Fish can be a pain to kill

Turn 2:

- Uncover what needs to be uncovered
- Have Fox pick up F1 and move towards the Rocket Launching base RL1
- Have Falco pick up M1 and intercept any missiles shot by RL1
- Have Slippy intercept EM1
- Reclaim RL2 with Amanda
- E1 will engage Slippy

Turn 3:

- Uncover the important locations
- Have fox take out RL1
- Move Amanda towards RL3
- Falco and Slippy are on anti-missile duty

Turn 4:

- Pick up F2 with Fox
- Take out RL3 with Amanda
- Falco and Slippy will take care of any more stray missiles

Combat Tips:

- Giant Spindly fish are a royal pain. They take alot of hits, and can dish out
a good laser barrage. Avoid fighting them by using missiles from Great Fox if
you can. If not, try to do as much damage as you can using bombs and attack the
fins where they connect to the body
- Against the Jellyfish, just go in guns a blazin' or use a bomb to wipe out the
whole group if you're feeling lazy
- The Puffers will fall easily to fully charged shots. Try to kill them with
one charged shot to avoid damage entirely.
- The Manta Ray can be easily destroyed by just pounding on where its tail meets
it's body
- When chasing missiles, remember that you have to shoot them once you get close
enough. Don't miss any beacons or else you'll lose track of the missile. For
chargers, just try to get a full charge while paying attention to the missile.
For Slippy, just let loose on the missile and watch it go down quickly.

MISSION COMPLETE!

After the battle, Slippy and Amanda have an emotional reunion. Falco decides to
tell Fox the important news he had before the battle. Now here's a bit of a
shocker, Krystal has joined up with Star Wolf! Not only that, but they are
planning to take Venom by themselves!

Peppy then sends a transmission stating that a large Anglar armada is heading
to Corneria and is planning to cut through the Asteroid Belt. You set a course
for Sector Z to intercept this fleet.

When you arrive at Sector Z, ROB informs you that there are multiple Anglar
fighters on the scanners. Krystal then transmits that she's safe. Fox asks her
to meet up and help take out the Anglar fleet.


==========================9.16) Mission 6: We meet Again========================

Planet: Sector Z
Characters: Fox, Falco, Slippy and Krystal

In this level, you have to watch out for the asteroid field (+ on my map). If
you pass through it, it will slow you down and you won't be able to cover as
much distance.

|____________________________________________|


Turn 1:

- No fog of war in this level!
- Send Krystal to E1 through M1
- Send Fox to E4
- Send Slippy towards RL1
- Send Falco towards E3
- E1 will engage Krystal
- E2 will move towards Krystal
- E3 will engage Falco
- E4 will engage Fox

Turn 2:

- Have Krystal move by E2 then continue towards RL3
- Keep Falco near Great Fox and fend off any missiles
- Send Fox towards RL2 through S1
- Move Slippy towards Great Fox to help with missiles after collecting F2
- Falco will engage EM1
- E2 will engage Krystal

Turn 3:

- Have Fox pick up F1
- Have Krystal hit RL3
- Falco and Slippy should take care of any stray missiles

Combat Tips:

- Against Angel Fish, just try to get behind a group of 3 and fire away
- Against the Spin Devil, just launch 2 bombs at it as it will not move
- Against the Ammonites, be very careful to watch your boost meters and pull
away when your barrel roll runs out. Krystal's ship is pretty weak here.
- Against the Bozoid, use the same tactics you used against the Assault Lasers,
attack them from behind, but watch out for the towers of fire
- Against the fighters at RL1, attack them and take out a group of them at once
- Against the dancers at RL2, use lock-on shots to waste the groups of enemies,
or use bombs if you're having trouble
- Against the bee machine at RL3, attack the "stinger". When it lifts the
stinger up, that means it is going to attack with a barrage of shots. Barrel 
roll to avoid damage.

MISSION COMPLETE!

After the mission, Krystal and Fox settle their differences and agree that 
Krystal should help with the fighting. Krystal tells about how her and the Star
Wolf team attacked the Anglar HQ on Venom and how the sea corroded their ships.
They agree that they should end the conflict by taking out the Anglar Emperor.
You set course for the Anglar armada which is in the Asteroid belt.

You are shown a scene where Emperor Anglar and one of his men are discussing the
destruction of their unit in Sector Z and their future plans. They decide to
wait in the Asteroid Belt for Star Fox before advancing on Corneria.

Back on the Great Fox, the crew prepares for battle


=============================9.16) Mission 6: Anglar===========================

Planet: Asteroid Belt
Characters: Fox, Slippy, Falco and Krystal

This is the final level of the first mission path. Not too challenging either.
If you have any missiles going into this level, feel free to use them at your
discretion.

a bomb
- Use lock-on shots against the Ammonites
- Just drop 2 bombs on the Spin Devil
- Against the enemies at EB1, just use charge shots to easily wipe them out

- EB1's defenders can be easily taken out with charged shots
- RL1's defenders can be destroyed by using charged shots when the shells open
- RL2's defenders can be destroyed by using charged shots.

BOSS! Arrow Head:

Anglar has decided to take things into his own hands and took his personal ship 
out to fight you himself.

- He's actually pretty easy. Take someone in who has a few bombs, try to drop
the bombs in his path and most of the tail parts will be destroyed. Repeat
if necessary
- Now just pound the crap out of the head while dodging the attacks to win.

MISSION COMPLETE!

After defeating the final boss of the first path, Star Wolf contacts you
expressing his anger that you were the ones who took out Emperor Anglar. Falco
assures Wolf that the bounty will be removed from their heads. They reassure
Krystal that they got away from Venom safely, although Panther is disappointed
that she left. They say goodbye and leave.

Peppy then sends a congratulatory message to Fox, telling him that he is a great
leader like his father.

- Each time you shoot one of the cubes, the face changes
- The pattern goes Red-Yellow-Green-Pigma

- The Red face launches multiple pillars of flames
- The Green face launches 3 volleys of 6 missiles. Shoot them down or boost away
- The Yellow face shoots a barrage of fireballs
- When all 4 are Pigma's face, the cubes move away and reveal the orb, but not
before a laser image of Pigma's face is launched at you. Shoot the orb while
avoiding the laser-face

Turn 1:

- Uncover the enemy bases
- Send Fox to RL2 through C1 and C3
- Send Peppy to EB1 through C1
- Send Falco North through C1 towards C2 to intercept EM1
- Send Slippy through C1 and C2 to attack EB2
- E1 will engage Falco or Slippy

- Send Fox to RL1 through C4
- Send Peppy to intercept E2 and EM1
- Send Falco to pick up M1 and intercept any other missiles there may be
- Send Slippy to RL1 through EB2 and F2

Combat Tips:

- Use bombs against the King Dodora before using lasers
- The mini Grunners go down easily to bombs
- The ships at RL1 shoot the ground with lasers causing towers of fire. Charge
shots from the side work best on them

After the map is cleared, you recieve a message from the ghost of Andross
saying that you will never retrieve the device from his bio weapon. A boss fight
begins with his bio weapon.

BOSS! Grunner:

- Pick whoever has the most health and has a charger on their lasers
- Grunner itself has no attacks. Rather, he calls up a pair of pillars that
shoot rocks at you and create an electrical barrier between them
- The best method is to have someone with a charge ability fly behind Gunner
and above the range of the stone towers' electrical barriers.
- You can only hurt him from behind

MISSION COMPLETE!

After completing the mission, your team taunts Andross as they pick up the
device.

Back on board Great Fox, the team ponders how the device works and decides that
it is the only way to complete their mission. Fox then announces that this will
be his final mission, so he can spend the rest of his life with Krystal.

You arrive at Venom and watch a short dialogue between Emperor Anglar and his
henchman Zazan where they discuss how to fight back the invasion mounted by
Star Fox. Fox then gives the final order to launch and the battle begins.

- For an easier time, use a bomb on it as it is entering/leaving a tube

After the Arrow Head is destroyed, Emperor Anglar himself will escape
through one of the tubes.

BOSS! Emperor Anglar:

- Anglar is protected by a forcefield generated by 3 orbs
- His attack is a stream of shots that can be easily deflected
- Shoot the orbs until they turn grey
- Anglar will charge up a shot and you need to roll and reflect this
shot back to him
- After the reflected shot hits him, his antenna will turn red. Get
as many shots on it as you can
- When at half his life, he will swim offscreen, leaving the orbs
to be destroyed. During this phase, large solid beams will fly in from
every direction
- After the 3 orbs are destroyed, Anglar returns to the screen and
uses some attacks he seems to have learned from Andross
- First he will suck in air. Use your brakes to avoid being eaten
- After he sucks in, he will blow out debris that can be deflected with
your roll
- During this time, just pound away at his head until he dies

===================================10. Endings==================================

Ending 1: Emperor Anglar

"The members of Star Fox had reunited once more! Again they put differences to 
one side and took the fight to the enemy. And when the dust cleared, peace had 
once again returned to Lylat. Yet Fox is still troubled by complicated
feelings...

Months pass. One dark day, Krystal makes a startling confession: "I'm sorry,
Fox! I can't do this anymore. I'm going back to be with Panther and the rest of
Star Wolf." Fox was overcome with grief and begged Krystal to stay... but her
mind was set.

Once again, Fox McCloud was forced to wander the world alone... and unloved. But
Krystal has no such regrets. She is perhaps the toughest of all the pilots, and
she proves it by starting a new life in the elite Star Wolf squadron..."

Ending 2: Pigma's Revenge

"Falco is consumed with rage. If all had gone to plan, he, Fox, and all the rest
would be heroes, writ large upon a galactic stage, reveling in endless 
retellings of their voctory. Instead, fate has seen fit to ostracize Falco from
the Star Fox squadron.

And then, just when things were bleakest, Falco got a message from Katt Monroe.
'Forget those losers! Grab a couple of friends and form a new squad!' Falco was
usually too stubborn to heed advice, but this message came at the right time.

Falco took Katt up on her offer, and they went hunting for a third pilot,
eventually finding their man--an elite Cornerian pilot named Dash! Together the
three of them formed Star Falco, a unit that rivaled even Star Fox."


Ending 3: Lucy and Krystal

"With the battle over and the day won, the entire team chips in to prepare a
huge celebratory feast. Everyone stays up eating and drinking and telling
stories long into the night.

Peppy and Lucy slip away to reminisce about Vivian Hare, the wife and mother
they lost to illness many years ago. Bringing up memories both joyful and
bittersweet, father and daughter sit and talk until the morning light.

And Krystal and Fox, reunited after so long, are finally able to speak of their
true feelings for each other. With new hope for the future, and a pledge of
eternal love from Fox, Krystal decides to rejoin team Star Fox."


Ending 4: Good-bye, Fox

"The Star Fox members vote to disband the squadron, and Fox promises to spend
his days living a quiet life with Krystal. But if a new threat threatens the
peace, will Fox keep his promise? To never fight again is a hard thing to ask of
a warrior...

Their son, Marcus, grows into a fine young pup, and the Fox family enjoys a
happy life together. Marcus enters the Cornerian Academy and follows his 
father's path. The apple does not fall far from the tree, as Marcus is gifted
with unbelievable flying skill.

Marcus soon forms an elite squadron to defend peace wherever it is threatened.
He teams up with Slippy's son and Peppy's granddaughter, and tracks down
legendary pilot Falco Lombardi. And with that, a new Star Fox is born"
