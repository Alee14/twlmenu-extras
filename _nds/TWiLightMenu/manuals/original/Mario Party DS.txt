Welcome back to another installment of the popular Mario Party game series! 
This time, the series has gone into the dual screen avenue, supporting the use 
of the touch screen and stylus for more minigames variety!

For those of you who do not know what kind of game Mario Party is, let me 
briefly explain it to you. The premise of the game is very simple. The main 
mode of Mario Party always involves a huge board where the character you choose 
to play as moves around, collecting some stuff to win the game while avoiding 
traps that are scattered around the board.

When you are ready to start the game, firstly, you need to choose which 
character out of the 8 classic Mario characters you would want to play as. You 
then choose one of the boards where you want to play at. Every step on any 
board is filled with many different attributes, including bonus spots giving 
you a few coins, item spot, shop spot, Bowser spot and many other things. Each 
board also has a unique set of features only available on that board, such as 
quick-game spots (to win a lot of coins or to avoid traps), transportation and 
even some annoying obstacles that will take your coins away! As you play 
through the Story Mode, you will unlock more boards for you to play at.

When the game starts, you would need to roll a dice to determine the order in 
which the characters will go. Next, to move around the board, you would need to 
roll the dice again, and shift your character a number of steps in the pre-
determined direction (you get to choose if the route is split up into two) 
according to the number shown on the dice.

Yes, you guess it right; Mario Party is played very similarly to our favorite 
board game, Monopoly... but with a twist! In Mario Party, you don't try to get 
as much money as you can like in Monopoly, but you are trying to become a 
superstar of the group in order to get a chance to defeat the "boss" you will 
face after all the turn on the board has expired.

The main objective of each play on the board is to collect as many STARS as you 
can during the specified number of turns you have been assigned at the very 
start of the play. To collect the stars, it is important that you have enough 
coins so that you can "purchase" the star! Moreover, with more coins, you can 
buy more items in the tunnel shop that is available on specific spot on the 
board. You need to use these items strategically so that you can outwit your 
opponents and steal the star before they get it first! Player with the most 
STAR at the end of all turn wins the game! If two or more characters have the 
same amount of stars, the coins would then become the determining factor.

After each turn, all the characters will be given a chance to battle it all out 
in a random minigame - it can be a 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, or 1 vs 3 minigame. Try to 
win in these minigames as these are your best chance to get more coins so you 
don't run out of coins when you need them the most!

The quality of the board is pretty high and the visual shown in this game is 
aesthetically pleasing. You would not get bored with the atmosphere presented 
in this game (but you may get bored due to the repetitive nature of the game).

There are many different modes in this game. Each mode is different, so there 
are a lot of things you can do in this game. You will love this game if you 
like any of the previous Mario Party titles as this game stays true to its 
roots! Enjoy the game, and perhaps try to beat some of the Staff Best records!

                             |    GAME MODES    |                        [0211]
                             o------------------o

There are 5 main game modes + gallery in Mario Party DS:

1. Story mode
   You may want to play this mode first in your first playthrough. Completing
   the story mode once will gain you access to many unlockables, such as
   Boss Bash mode, Sound Test and a new puzzle game. The story mode consists
   of 5 boards in which you have to win in order to fight the boss at the end
   of each board play. You are allowed to choose any one of the 8 main
   characters to play the story mode before you begin the mode. Completing
   the story mode with that character gives you the badge of that particular
   character. Therefore, if you are planning to get all the badges, you have
   to play the story mode (from the beginning to the end) at least 8 times!
   This guide will focus mainly on this mode.

2. Party mode
   In this mode, you can free play in any board with any of the characters
   against anyone. However, this mode is for single player only, despite the
   name "party" as the mode. You can play Mario Party in the following style:
   - Battle Royale
   - Tag Battle
   - Duel Battle
   You can also choose to learn how to play Mario Party game if you do not
   already know how to play the game.

3. Minigame mode
   In this mode, you can free play all the minigames you have unlocked in
   either story mode or party mode. You can choose to play in the following:
   - Free Play
   - Step It Up
   - Score Scuffle
   - Boss Bash
   - Rocket Rascals
   Many of this sub-mode can be accessed after you have completed the story
   mode at least once. You can then practice your minigame skill and try to
   set a new high score record in this mode.

4. Puzzle mode
   This mode consists of two types of puzzles: Classic puzzles, i.e. puzzles
   that can be played by using the DS buttons, and not the stylus and the
   exclusive puzzle, which required the stylus in order to play one of the
   sub-modes of this new puzzle. You can unlock this secret puzzle by
   completing the story mode one time.

5. Multiplayer
   By entering this mode, your DS will immediately start searching another
   player to join your Mario Party game. Your friends can join the game for
   a session by using DS Download Play. You only need one cartridge for your
   friend to join your game (but of course, your friends need to have their
   own DS!). You need to connect using this mode so you can play with real
   people (not only computers). You can play any of the above mode while
   connected to your friend. Note that if you play the Party Mode with your
   linked friend before you unlock all of the minigames, all minigames will
   become available for you to play even after you disconnect!

6. Gallery
   In this mode, you can check all sort of things you have done in this game.
   You can check all the item collection you have gained throughout your
   playthrough, view all the story scenes you have encountered in the story
   mode, view all your records in any applicable minigames. Play music and
   sound used in Mario Party DS, and check all minigames you have unlocked!


There are 8 characters you can choose in Mario Party DS:
1. Mario      5. Peach
2. Luigi      6. Daisy
3. Wario      7. Waluigi
4. Yoshi      8. Toad


There are 5 boards you can choose in Mario Party DS:
1. Wiggler's Garden
2. Toadette's Music Room
3. DK's Stone Statue
4. Kamek's Library

HOW TO PLAY: Catch the bomb seeds that the Piranha Plant spits out, then drop
             them back in the boss's open mouth!

CONTROLS: Use the directional buttons to move left or right.
          Press A to go up faster.
          Press B to catch or throw the bomb seeds.

TIPS: The Piranha Plant's suction will slowly grow stronger. Tap A repeatedly
      to struggle upward and avoid being swallowed.

STRATEGY
--------
The Piranha Plant is at the bottom screen and your character is at the top 
screen. There are 6 bomb seeds at the top screen, 3 on each side. Your 
character is tied to a balloon which consistently moves downward. You would 
need to press the A button a few times in order to stay at the top screen and 
avoid to be munched by the Piranha Plant at the bottom.

The Piranha Plant will start sucking the bomb seeds. Avoid the falling bomb 
seeds while mashing the A button repeatedly so that you don't get suck as well 
(if you touch a bomb seed, it will push you down a lot but you don't lose a 
life). After the Plant munches on the bomb seeds, it will throw all the bomb 
seeds back to the top screen. You don't need to mash the A button here as the 
Plant doesn't suck you in. Avoid all but one of the bombs. Move close to one of 
the bomb seeds, then press the B button ONCE to catch the bomb so it doesn't 
explode on you. Note that if you already take one bomb, you cannot catch 
another bomb, and if you hit another bomb while carrying a bomb, you will lose 
a life plus your bomb as well. Therefore, you may want to catch the latest bomb 
if possible.

Hold onto the bomb for a while. The next time the Piranha Plant opens its big 
mouth to suck more bomb seeds, quickly press the B button again to release the 
bomb. It will automatically fall into the Plant's mouth and explode inside it, 
causing the Piranha Plant to lose one life! If you don't release the bomb at 
this time, the bomb will explode and hurt you instead!

Do this three times and you are well on your way to beat the Piranha Plant. 
Remember, the number of seeds the Plant sucked increases for each life it 
loses. At first, the Piranha Plant will only take and throw 2 bomb seeds. Next, 
it will take 3, and on its last life, it will take 4 bomb seeds.

HOW TO PLAY: Memorize the tune that Hammer Bro plays, then repeat it before
             his music notes strike you.

CONTROLS: Use your stylus to beat the drums.

TIPS: Even if you hit the wrong drum, you can try again if the music note
      hasn't reached you yet. Take your time, despite the danger!

STRATEGY
--------
The easiest boss on the game. You should be able to beat Hammer Bro in under 
30 seconds if you have a pretty good memory. One minute max if your memory is 
kinda failing...

There are four colored drums each at the top and bottom screens. Hammer Bro 
will then start hitting the drum in some order. Memorize the order, then use 
your stylus to touch the corresponding drum with the same color (in order of 
course) as fast as you can. If you are too slow (very very slow), some music 
notes will kick you, causing you to lose a life! If you are fast enough, the 
music notes will be reflected back to Hammer Bro causing him to lose a life!

Do this three times and you are well on your way to defeat the Hammer Bro. 
Remember, the number of drum you would need to touch increases for each life 
Hammer Bro loses. At first, you will only need to remember 3 sequences. Next, 
it will be 4, and lastly, it will be 5.

HOW TO PLAY: Search for the fire icons that appear above the magic switches,
             then ground-pound them all to release a fiery blast at Dry Bones!

CONTROLS: Use the directional buttons to move around.
          Press A to jump. Press A again while on air to ground-pound.
          Press B to punch.
          Press the L or R button to move the camera focus.
          Press X to focus the camera on the boss (Zoom out).

TIPS: Dry Bones will soon go nuts, throwing bones and berries. If you punch a
      berry, it'll fly at him and he'll be stunned. Use the time to hit a
      switch!

STRATEGY
--------
Dry Bones is a pretty annoying boss. You would need to cast some magic spell 
from some magic stones on the ground in order to paralyze and wipe out Dry 
Bones. To activate the spell, you need to stomp on the correct magic stone(s) 
by pressing A, then A again while on the air, while in while trying to avoid 
the crazy Dry Bones.

The map at the top screen is really helpful to determine your position, Dry 
Bones location and the next magic stone you would need to stomp on. You may 
also find it helpful to zoom out the camera and focus it on the boss by 
pressing the X button once. If you don't like it, just press the X button again 
at anytime to return to the default camera and you can then rotate the view to 
the left or right at anytime by using the L or R button.

Dry Bones will throw you all assortment of random stuff, such as a big red 
berry, bones and something like small tornado. Dry Bones will also jump high, 
then aiming to fall right on top of you. Most of these attacks are from your 
behind or somewhere unseen if you have the default camera view and you don't 
try to adjust the view! Run blindly as fast as you can to your destination and 
stomp stomp. This will work most of the times, but why not just utilize the 
superior zoom out view (by pressing the X button)?

On the later stage, you need to stomp on the magic stones in the correct order. 
Otherwise, they won't work. The order is shown on the map at the top screen 
right after you hit the Dry Bones, and then this order will be repeated on the 
overhead map (the cycle will pause for a while after it ends, so you know where 
it starts).

Cast the magic spell three times and you will defeat the Dry Bones safe and 
sound. Remember though, the number of magic stones you would need to stomp 
increases for each life Dry Bones loses. At first, you will only need to stomp 
on 1 stone. Next, it will be 2, and on the last life, it will be 3.

o-----------o

HOW TO PLAY: Survive a flight down Kamek's library hallway, then take on the
             henchman. Shoot ink blobs at Kamek's face until he's totally inky!

CONTROLS: Use the directional buttons to move up/down and left/right.
          Press A to fire ink blobs.

TIPS: Flying books and sliding bookcases will keep you on your toes. So keep
      an eye out for surprises on your way to fight Kamek.

STRATEGY
--------
This is a long battle against Kamek. You first start the battle on the entrance 
of the corridor to Kamek's room. You will then need to evade all the flying 
books and random bookcases in the corridor. Remember that you can shot the 
books down, but if you are not fast enough, the book will eat your head out or 
something like that that caused your character to lose one life. You can also 
sometimes destroy upper or lower half of the bookcase obstacles, so you can get 
past through them without getting hurt.

Good tips for preserving your lives in your flight to Kamek's room are to stay 
on the lower part of the corridor and keep shooting by mashing the A button no 
matter what. This is necessary because some bookcases may suddenly appear in 
your face. While some of the lower part of the bookcases can be tore down, some 
of them can't be destroyed with your ink, so you just have to have a good 
reflect and move to the side. The bookcases can only be in three spots anyway: 
left side, middle and right side - not anywhere else in between. I don't think 
the placement of these things is random, so if you lose too many lives here on 
your first couple of tries, you may want to try to memorize where some of the 
indestructible bookcases are, and move away from them.

Once you reach Kamek's room and see Kamek dancing while shooting you with his 
"triangle square circle" magic spell, aim at his face. Keep shooting until he 
goes "Oh no!" and start firing the magic spell in random direction. Many green 
books will also randomly start falling down to the sides/corners of the room. 
Ironically, you don't need to move at all while Kamek is doing his crazy 
ordeal. Just stay at the bottom middle part of the screen and watch the show. 
Once it's all said and done, a big book will fall on Kamek's head causing him 
to lose a life and NOW your safe zone is not so saved again, so you need to 
move to the side to avoid the big book.

Now with two lives left, Kamek will start aiming TWO "triangle square circle" 
magic spells at you and then send a green blocks tower to protect his face and 
coming crashing into your character, so you need to fly high or very low on the 
left or right side to avoid these blocks. Keep shooting ink on Kamek's ugly 
face until he goes mad and firing his spells randomly again. Stay on your safe 
zone and wait until you see another big book smacking Kamek's head. Move to the 
side a bit to avoid this biggie just like you did before.

On his last life, Kamek introduces you to three life-reducing obstacles! First 
is the same, still the "triangle square circle" magic spell, but now with THREE 
spells and they are more difficult to avoid (still pretty easy though if you 
watch the direction...)! Next is the green blocks stuff. This time the safe 
area forms an "H" in the middle of the screen. The last one is two books on 
your left and right side moving up and down following your character. They will 
come closing in on you, so move in the opposite direction (up or down) 
immediately when you see the book vibrating, ready to take your life. In here, 
while avoiding the books, is your best chance to shoot Kamek's face with your 
ink until he goes crazy! Watch the show again and a very very big book will 
finally fall on Kamek's head - giving you a victory!

| Bowser's Block Party |
o----------------------o

HOW TO PLAY: Avoid Bowser's attacks after he transforms into Blockhead Bowser,
             then wait for your chance to strike his golden weak spot!

CONTROLS: Use the directional buttons to move around.
          Press A to jump. Press A again while on air to ground-pound.
          Press B to punch. Press A then B while on air to kick.
          Press the L or R button to move the camera focus.
          Press X to focus the camera on the boss (Zoom out).

TIPS: Bowser will stack his blocks in different ways, and each of his forms
      has a different attack. Study his forms carefully to know his attacks!

STRATEGY
--------
Kick the golden block 5 times to take out each one of Bowser's 3 lives. On 
Bowser's first form, he will fire 4 fires in four different directions. These 
are very easy to avoid as they don't target you. He will then spin around the 
battle arena for a short while. When he stops spinning, this is your chance to 
kick the golden weak spot! One life down.

Next, Bowser will transform into a box. It moves around one step at a time 
while firing 4 fires in different directions again! However, this time, you 
have to kick his weak spot on the go when you have the chance. Kick a couple 
times, move on to avoid the fireball, and then repeat until you kick him 5 
times. Two lives down.

On his last life, Bowser will be in the form of a snake. You cannot kick his 
weak spot (which is the snake's head) when he is moving around the border of 
the arena. Just stay in the middle and move a bit to avoid the fireballs that 
are targeting your character. When the head moves to the middle of the arena, 
the steam around the head will be no more and this is your chance to kick the 
weak spot! Be careful though, as the head will fire 3 fireballs and push you 
back. Check the timing and you will know when these fireballs will be shot out. 
Then move away from the head as it starts to spew out the steam again. Repeat 
this until you kick the weak spot 5 times!

If you are having difficulty seeing where Bowser and his attacks are, you may 
want to switch the camera focus by pressing the X button once.

When you beat Bowser, you have finally completed the story mode of Mario Party 
DS! Now go play another modes you have unlocked by finishing the story mode 
once, and maybe play the story mode again with another character to earn their 
badge while collecting more MP Points and collectibles!

                           oo---------------------oo
                           |  4-PLAYER MINI GAMES  |                    [0411]
                           o-----------------------o

01 - Goomba Wrangler
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Capture Goombas by circling them using your stylus.
               Brown Goombas are worth one point.
               Golden Goombas are worth three points.

  TIPS: Don't circle Bob-ombs. If you do, you'll lose half your points.


02 - Rail Riders
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Build speed for a long jump. You'll go farther the more you
               slide your stylus up the screen before the jump.

  TIPS:  As you slide your stylus rapidly, use the full height of the screen.


03 - Dress for Success
----------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Select the body cards that match the face cards using your
               stylus. To win, score three points first, or score the most
               points by the end of the minigame.

  TIPS: When shown the four different cards, take note which character design
        is the correct one, then keep track of it while the cards are shuffled!


04 - Camera Shy
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Take a photo of everyone else in the maze. Your target must be
               in focus, so take the photo only when the frame turns green.
               Use the directional buttons to move around, and press the A
               A button to snap a photo.

  TIPS: Your flashbulb needs time to recharge after every use, so make sure
        you have a shot in focus before you shoot.


05 - Hedge Honcho
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish by throwing leaves out of your path using
               your stylus. Shoo off ladybugs with your stylus, but don't
               touch the bees at all. They'll soon buzz off themselves.

  TIPS: If a bee stings you, you'll be stunned for a while, so wait for it
        to fly off. Shoo off a ladybug by rubbing it with the stylus.


06 - Study Fall
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Plunge down the magnetic board as far as you can. Stop as close
               to the red line as possible, but don't hit the erasers at the
               bottom. To stop, press the A button.

  TIPS: You'll get a score of zero if you overshoot the red line and hit the
        erasers, so be careful.


07 - Domino Effect
------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Leap across the board tops by pressing the buttons as they're
               shown (either A, B, X or Y). Stay ahead of the boards as they
               topple behind you.

  TIPS: Press only the shown button to make each next leap. You'll lose time
        if you press a wrong button.


08 - Cherry-Go-Round
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Build up a great distance throw with your pair of cherries.
               You'll throw it farther the more you swirl your stylus before
               the throw.

  TIPS: The arrows show a clockwise swirl, but you can actually swirl in
        whichever way is best for you.


09 - Trace Cadets
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Build upon your corner by tracing the outlines of any bordering
               shapes. Here's a complication: you must sketch each shape
               without lifting your stylus!

  TIPS: You can't trace just any shape on your field. The only pieces you can
        trace are those that are outlined in your character's color.


10 - Soccer Survival
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Dodge the Goomba's soccer balls. There are two ways to win:
               outlast the timer or be the last player standing. To move
               around, use the directional buttons. To jump, press A.

  TIPS: The Goomba may kick the ball at you in a variety of ways, including
        a crazy zigzag motion. Watch the ball carefully!


11. Hot Shots
-------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Draw your bow with your stylus and aim for a target. Bowser is
               worth 100 points. Kamek is worth 20 points. You'll lose 30
               points if you hit Toadette.

  TIPS: Shoot quickly, but watch out for all the Toadette targets!


12. Call of the Goomba
----------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Listen to the tempo of the intro tune, then turn the crank
               using your stylus to re-create that speed as closely as
               possible. The better you do, the more Goombas you'll lure.

  TIPS: Your music box will emit colorful notes when you're cranking at the
        perfect speed.


13. Pedal Pushers
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish by alternating the pedals. The faster you
               do so, the faster you'll go. Use any direction of the
               directional buttons to press the left pedal, and use either
               A, B, X or Y button to press the right pedal.

  TIPS: When you reach a slick area, don't alternate quickly or you'll spin
        out. Do it slowly until you cross the slick.


14. Roller Coasters
-------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish by pushing your ball with the stylus.
               Avoid the obstacles along the way.

  TIPS: You'll rebound from any obstacle you hit, and it will take time to
        recover your momentum. Move carefully.


15. Get the Lead Out
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Push your mechanical pencil's lead out as far as you can. You'll
               have 10 seconds to hit the extender button as many times as you
               can. Press the A button rapidly to extend the lead.

  TIPS: The more you press the button, the farther you'll extend the pencil
        lead, so press it quickly!


16. Shortcut Circuit
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Grab as many coins as possible. You'll travel in the direction
               of path arrows, so drag the bridge pieces to make paths that
               carry you through coins.

  TIPS: Each bridge piece can be crossed only once. So lay pieces down
        strategically so you reach them before others do.


17. Big Blowout
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish by running along the tips of candles. Blow
               them out by blowing into your DS microphone to clear the way.

  TIPS: How many candles go dark depends on how long and hard you blow into
        the Mic. Try to blow out as many as you can to clear a long path.


18. Trash Landing
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Pick a rope, then watch carefully as all players glide across
               the garage. Jump off at the right time to fall onto the
               garbage platforms. Use the directional buttons to choose
               which rope to use, then press A to grab the rope. Press the
               A button again to let go off the rope.

  TIPS: The platforms for each rope are different sizes, which affects how
        difficult it will be to land safely. Do your best, no matter which
        platform you're stuck with!


19. Cheep Cheep Chance
----------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Haul up a Cheep Cheep to be among the winners. When it's your
               turn, select a line by using the directional buttons and the
               A button to grab the line. You'll then see if you're lucky
               enough to have hooked one.

  TIPS: It's a game of chance, so select a line, then hope that you nab a
        Cheep Cheep!


20. Whomp-a-thon
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Survive among the falling Whomps until the timer runs out to
               win, or just be the last one standing. Use the directional
               buttons to move around.

  TIPS: A Whomp will shake before it falls flat. That's your signal to get
        out of its way!


21. Twist and Route
-------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish in your windup car. You'll have to wind it
               up often using your stylus, because driving the car and running
               across obstacles will use up its power. Use the left/right
               directional buttons or Y/A buttons to steer the car.

  TIPS: Your car is out of power when you see arrows on the Touch Screen. You
        can wind it up only when the arrows appear, so give it a good crank.


22. Crater Crawl
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid getting hit by lava eruptions until the timer runs out
               to win, or just be the last one standing. Use the left/right
               directional buttons to move to the side, and use the A button
               rapidly to go above the other characters.

  TIPS: A lava gush will bubble before it blows. That's your signal to get
        out of its way.


23. Boogie Beam
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Strike the correct pose with your stylus when the big beats
               hit. Watch if the spotlight shines on you. If it does, strike
               the left pose. If it doesn't strike the right one.

  TIPS: The spotlight doesn't have a regular pattern. Watch carefully before
        you strike a pose button.


24. Parachutin' Gallery
-----------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Skydive through the panels that match those shown on the top
               screen using the directional buttons.

  TIPS: Each type of target has a unique color. You may be able to reach
        faster if you watch for colors, rather than patterns.


25. Boo Tag
-----------
  HOW TO PLAY: Keep the Boos off your back. Tag a rival to lose your Boo.
               After time runs out, whoever has spent the least amount of
               time with the Boos is the winner. Use the directional buttons
               to move around.

  TIPS: If you have a Boo on your back, chase other players until you tag 
        someone to transfer your Boo.


26. Dust Buddies
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid getting sucked up by the vacuum until your reach the
               finish, or just be the last one standing. Use the directional
               buttons to move, and use the A button to jump.

  TIPS: Sidestep the buttons and balls. Be careful when you step on ribbons
        or film strips, because the vacuum will quickly suck those up.


27. Cyber Scamper
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish or just be the last one standing on a course
               full of holes and chasm crossings. Use the directional buttons
               to move, and use the A button to jump.

  TIPS: When the lights go out, you can't tell where the gaps are. Memorize
        where the safe footing is when the lights are on!


28. Soap Surfers
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Knock all rivals out of the sink as you surf on a soap bar using
               the directional buttons. Avoid getting knocked out before the
               time runs out, or be the last one standing.

  TIPS: Stay on the move and change direction often as you try to stay
        in the middle area.


29. Sweet Sleuth
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Give Shy Guy the candy he craves by using your stylus to drag
               the correct candy out of the dish, then drop it in front of
               the Shy Guy.

  TIPS: Study the dish selection closely before you select a candy. You want
        to pick the correct ones, and many candies look similar.


30. Tidal Fools
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Grab as many coins as you can, but don't get hit by the waves.
               Red coins are worth five times as much as the normal ones.
               Use the directional buttons to move around.

  TIPS: You'll be stunned for a while if you're hit by a wave. Time your
        runs carefully to avoid the waves.


31. Raft Riot
-------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to the finish in your rubber raft. Jump the ramps to get
               a short burst of speed. Use the directional buttons to move.
               Hold the A button to accelerate; hold the B button to brake.

  TIPS: Running into an obstacle or a racer will make you bounce around, and
        it'll take time to regain your momentum. Steer carefully.


32. All Geared Up
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Climb the gears and platforms to reach the goal. Some platforms
               may rotate or disappear after some time. Use the directional
               buttons to move around, and press the A button to jump.

  TIPS: Head for the goal by the least crowded path you can find. If you get
        stuck near someone, you'll waste time trying to make your way upward.

                           o-----------------------o

1. Power Washer
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Wash all your rivals off the plate by rotating the water
  (as 1)       sprayer using your stylus. Defeat all three to win.

  TIPS: You can rotate the plate in either direction, so keep an eye on where
  (as 1)   your opponents are, then catch them off guard when you can.

  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid the water jets as you try to survive on the plate. If
  (as 3)       even one of the three plate runners outlasts the timer, all
               three win the challenge. Use the directional buttons to move
               around, and press the A button to jump.

  TIPS: Be prepared to change your course, because the plate can change
  (as 3)   direction at any time. After a while the second water jet will
           also spray.


2. Peek-a-Boo
-------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Tap as many Boos that match the target type as you can using
               your stylus. You'll have to shift your view of the floor as
               you scan the crowd for them by using the directional buttons
               or the A, B, X and Y buttons.

  TIPS: Your view is much larger than the other team's views. But there are
  (as 1)   three of them and only one of you!

  TIPS: The single player's view is much larger than your team's views.
  (as 3)   Fortunately, there are three of you, so divide up the floor
           for your search!


3. Fast Food Frenzy
-------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Trip up your opponents by throwing food in their way using
  (as 1)       your stylus. Ice-cream dishes may freeze them, and pancake 
               syrup will slow them. Defeat all three to win.

  TIPS: Don't just throw food randomly. Create a course that makes your
  (as 1)   opponents run farther. They may fall behind as they try to
           outrun the belt.

  HOW TO PLAY: Dodge food and avoid falling off the conveyor belt. If even
  (as 3)       of you survives, you'll all win. Use the directional buttons
               to move around, and press the A button to jump.

  TIPS: You can't leap over the burger or the shake. You'll freeze if you step
  (as 3)   on the ice-cream dish. You'll be slowed if you step on the pancakes.

  (as 3)       pressing either left or right directional button in the hopes
               that the train goes down the other one. You can outrun the
               train by pressing the A, B, X and Y buttons.

  TIPS: Don't run down the same track as your teammates if you can help it.
  (as 3)   Only one of you needs to survive for your team to win.


5. Shuffleboard Showdown
------------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Trip your opponents by throwing chips at them using your stylus.
  (as 1)       Chips will rebound from walls or other chips, so take
               advantage of that for surprise attacks.

  TIPS: Bank your shot off walls and other chips to catch your opponents
  (as 1)   off guard.

  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid getting hit by chips. Watch them carefully, because
  (as 3)       they'll rebound from walls and other chips. If even one of
               you survives, you'll all win. Use the directional buttons to
               move around, and press the A button to jump.

  TIPS: In the last few moments, watch for chips that fall from above. They'll
  (as 3)   cast shadows on the table, so steer clear of those spots.


6. Flash and Dash
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid being caught in the flashlight beams cast by your three
  (as 1)       rivals as you all run through a dark maze. You'll win if you
               outlast the timer. Use the directional buttons to move.

  TIPS: More of your warning lights will go on the closer your opponents
  (as 1)   get to catching you in their beams.

  HOW TO PLAY: Catch your opponent in your flashlight beam as you and your
  (as 3)       teammates run through a dark maze. Use the directional buttons
               to move.

  TIPS: More of your warning lights will go on the closer you come to your
  (as 3)   target. So cooperate with your teammates to track down your target.


7. Rubber Ducky Rodeo
---------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Steer wildly so your tethered rivals are thrown from their
  (as 1)       duckies. Throw them all into the water to win. Use the left
               and right directional buttons to steer.

  TIPS: Swerve quickly to have the best chance of knocking your opponents
  (as 1)   off their duckies.

  HOW TO PLAY: As your rival drives wildly, keep your balance so you don't
  (as 3)       fall off your ducky! If even one passenger stays seated, you'll
               all win. Use the left/right directional button to balance.

  TIPS: Keep an eye on your rival's ducky. When the driver turns, change
  (as 3)   your seating to stay balanced on your ducky.


8. Plush Crush
------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Avoid the toys that your opponents try to drop on you by using
  (as 1)       the directional buttons. Watch for shadows that appear just
               before a toy crashes down on the spot.

  TIPS: Don't let yourself be cornered. Stay in the most wide-open area to
  (as 1)   to give yourself the best chance of escape.

  HOW TO PLAY: Drop a toy on your opponent to win! Work with the other players
  (as 3)       to trap and squish the target using your stylus.

  TIPS: It takes time to drop a toy, so work with your teammates to cut off
  (as 3)   your target's escape routes.


9. Rotisserie Rampage
---------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Spin your opponents off of the hunk of meat by turning it
  (as 1)       unpredictably using your stylus.

  TIPS: Change the rotation unpredictably to have the best chance of
  (as 1)   catching your opponents off guard.

  HOW TO PLAY: Keep your balance by pressing the up or down directional button
  (as 3)       so you don't fall off the rotating hunk of meat. If even one
               of you survives, you'll all win.

  TIPS: Don't run too far in one direction as you try to stay on, or you might
  (as 3)   get caught off guard when your opponent turns it the other way.


10. Nothing to Luge
-------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race down the hill on your spool sled! Scraping a corner during
               a turn will slow you down, so take corners smoothly! Press the
               L button to turn left, and press the R button to turn right.

  TIPS: You'll lose speed if you scrape the sides of the chute. Watch the
        course ahead so you know when and how to swerve.


11. Penny Pinchers
------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Grab the coins that spill from the chest, but don't get hit by
  (as 1)       beads. Red coins are worth five times as much as the normal
               ones. Use the directional buttons to move around, and press
               the A button to jump.

  TIPS: You'll be stunned for a while if you're hit by a bead, so be careful
  (as 1)   when you're running for coins.

  HOW TO PLAY: Use your grabber to get the coins that slip past your opponent
  (as 3)       on the top screen by using your stylus. Red coins are worth
               five times as much as the normal ones.

  TIPS: Divide up the lower-screen area with your teammates so you don't
  (as 3)   let any coins slip by you.


12. Gusty Blizzard
------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Blow on your DS microphone to chill your three opponents until
  (as 1)       they are fully frozen.

  TIPS: The strength of your deep freeze depends on how long and hard you blow
  (as 1)   into the Mic. Try to cause the deepest freeze you can.

  HOW TO PLAY: Stay warm in the freezing blizzard by rubbing your character
  (as 3)       with the stylus. If even one character remains unfrozen, all
               three win the challenge.

  TIPS: Rubbing your character with the stylus a little here and that is
  (as 3)   the best way to stay warm!

                           o-----------------------o

1. Soil Toil
------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You spin one front wheel of a car, and your teammate spins
               the other one. Cooperate to race your car to the finish.
               Use your stylus to spin the wheel.

  TIPS: Your car will swerve in the direction of whichever wheel is
        spinning more slowly. So coordinate spins with your partner
        to move where you want.


2. Double Vision
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You and your partner share tracing duties as you re-create an
               image. Trace only lines that match your color using the stylus.
               You'll earn points for good tracing.

  TIPS: You can trace more accurately to get more points by going slowly.
        But if you go too slowly, you may not finish in time, and your
        score will be lower.


3. Memory Mash
--------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Flip cards to find pairings by ground-pounding them. The team
               that finds four pairs first wins. Use the directional buttons
               to move around; press the A button to jump; press A again
               while jumping to do the ground-pounding.

  TIPS: Watch the cards that other players turn over as well, so you can
        remember their location and content.


4. Cube Crushers
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race to escape the ice maze with your partner. Both of you must
               hit the exit buttons in each section to open the way forward.
               Use the directional buttons to move around, and press the B
               button to punch the ice blocks and exit buttons.

  TIPS: If you hit a ? Block, you'll find either an invincibility Star or a
        spiky ball that will freeze you. You can punch a frozen partner to
        free your partner.


5. Mole Thrill
--------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You and your partner must dig to the finish first, while staying
               ahead of Monty Mole. You'll dig upward if the upper player digs
               faster... and vice versa! Press A button rapidly to dig.

  TIPS: Don't get caught behind rocks. To go above them, the top player should
        dig faster. To go under them, the lower player should dig faster.


6. Sprinkler Scalers
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You and your partner must match button-press actions to scale
               up the pipe to the top first, turning to avoid any obstacles
               along the way by pressing the A button to rotate right or
               the Y button to rotate left. Press the X button to climb up.

  TIPS: If your button presses don't match your partner's, you'll slide back
        down the pipe. Coordinate your efforts closely.


7. Cucumber Jacks
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You and your partner must slice down the full length of the
               cucumber by attacking the veggie from both ends using your
               stylus.

  TIPS: Slicing quickly is key, but do it with longer movements to whittle
        down the cucumber at top speed.


8. Hanger Management
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Balance your weight on the wire hanger to assist your partner
               as you both zing through a clothesline course. Shift left
               and right using the directional buttons to avoid obstacles.

  TIPS: You should stay in the middle to move the fastest. But shift position
        quickly when you see an "!" to avoid collision.


9. Book It!
-----------
  HOW TO PLAY: Race up the stairs with your partner by taking turns pressing
               the noted buttons (A -> B -> Y -> X twice) to lift your partner,
               then to shift him or her to another platform.

  TIPS: Reduce your time by doing your part at just the right time. Watch
        the action closely so you can make a smooth trade-off each time.


10. Airbrushers
---------------
  HOW TO PLAY: You and your partner each take one wing as you flap toward
               floating coins. Red coins are worth five times as much as
               the normal one. Press the A button to flap wing.

  TIPS: To get the higher coins, you and your partner must each repeatedly
        flap your wing at the same time.


11. Toppling Terror
-------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Blow onto your DS microphone to startle Whomp into falling on
               the other team. Whichever team blows the most over five seconds
               will be victorious!

  TIPS: Blow as long and hard as you can. And make sure that your partner
        does the same!


12. Crazy Crosshairs
--------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Shoot as many Scuttlebugs as you can. Golden ones are worth
               three points. You and your partner split the aiming into
               horizontal and vertical control! Use the A button to control
               your crosshair.

  TIPS: The first player to press a button locks in aiming control. The second
        player then fires. The first player has vertical control (left right),
        and the second player has horizontal control (up down).


13. Shorty Scorers
------------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Work with your partner to get as many balls into the other
               team's goal as possible. The goalkeepers move left and right
               automatically. Use the directional buttons to move; press A
               to jump, B to punch or shot and Y to pass the ball.
 
  TIPS: You can punch other players to get the ball away from them. And they
        can do the same to you!

               A button repeatedly to paddle away from the water vortex!

        repeatedly to attempt an escape.


2. Star Catchers
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Be the first to tap each new star as it appears in the sky
               using your stylus. Whoever scores more stars is the winner.

  TIPS: Stars will appear one after another in the night sky. When you see
        one flash into place, be the first to claim it!


3. Short Fuse
-------------
  HOW TO PLAY: All players take turns blowing on the bomb fuse, hoping to make
               the bomb blow up for the next player. If you're caught in a
               blast, you're out! You need to blow into your DS microphone to
               do this.

  TIPS: You must blow on the bomb at least a little, or else the bomb will
        blow up anyway! So blow just a little, even if the fuse is very short!


4. Globe Gunners
----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: Run around on the world globe, trying to score the most blast
               hits on your opponents. Use the directional buttons to move
               around, and press the A button to shoot.

  TIPS: Check your opponents' positions by looking at the map on the top
        screen. Try to close in on your opponent from the side, then shoot!


5. Chips and Dips
-----------------
  HOW TO PLAY: In a game of chance, select a card in each round to win the
               chips shown. If you pick a Bowser card, however, you'll lose
               half your stack. Use your stylus to pick a card.

  TIPS: It's purely a game of chance, since all the cards are facedown. Just
        hope you don't pick a Bowser card!
