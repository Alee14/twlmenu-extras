                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Hello everyone, and thank you for clicking the link to view this guide. I hope 
that this will be a helpful tool for you while playing Revenant Wings. Use the 
glossary numbers to find what you need.

The game is a sequel to its PS2 predecessor, where we last saw our heroes on 
Sky Fortress Bahamut to prevent a war from occurring. They succeeded, and 
Ivalice fell into an era of peace. However, as what inevitably happens in any
sequel, new problems arise. Vaan and Penelo stand up to these challenges.

Before I speak further I must warn all who read this that there will be some
spoilers throughout, both for this game and the previous one. I assume you have
played the first game, and if you didn't, the portable version won't make too 
much sense otherwise.

I'll note that I WILL mix storyline missions with optional/melee missions. I 
will cover these as soon as they become available, not in a different section.

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This section will give a quick explanation about each element of the game, if 
you are a beginner or if you happen to be confused about something and would 
like to understand more.

031 - Game Controls

        Select: ...I haven't seen it do anything in the game so far.

        Touch a tab once to select the entire group. Touch a tab twice to select
        only the leader. Pull down a tab to select units within a group. Drag 
        the stylus to select multiple units. To close a tab, push it up or touch
        the up icon at the bottom right of the drop down.

        touching them with the stylus. Drag the stylus to select multiple units 
        at once. Touch the Deselect icon (the red X) in the upper-right corner 
        of the bottom screen to clear all selections.

      - Moving: Touching an open space on the battlefield while a unit is 
        selected will change the cursor to a pair of boots. Lift the stylus to 
        order the selected unit(s) to move to that location. You can drag the 
        stylus to select an off-screen destination.

      - Attacking: Touching an enemy while a unit is selected will change the 
        cursor to a pair of crossed swords. Lift the stylus to order the
        selected unit(s) to attack. You can drag the stylus to select an off-
        screen enemy.

      - Healing: Healers cannot attack, but instead use a magick to restore 
        their allies' HP. Touching an ally while a healer is selected will 
        change the cursor to a heart. Life the stylus to heal.

034 - Gambits

Gambits allow group leaders to automatically use a single magick or ability 
they've previously learned. You can set gambits from the Equip Screen or at any 
time during battle. 

Unfortunately in this FFXII game you can only equip one gambit per character in
any given moment. Make good use of which one you choose. It is up to you and 
what you value best--however, your preferred setup can change depending on the 
battle you wish to complete.

Here is a complete list of each character's gambits:

035 - Quickenings

Quickenings are powerful abilities that can instantly turn the tide of battle. 
Using quickenings consumes a unit's Mist charge, which accumulates as you defeat
enemies. Defeating certain boss monsters unlocks new quickenings.

Here is a complete list of each character's quickening:

Vaan: Pyroclasm
        - Deal heavy damage to all foes in range.
        - You obtain this after beating Belias.

Penelo: Dance of Rapture
        - Fully restore all allies' HP and remove all debuffs.
        - You obtain this after beating Ultima.

Kytes: Nature's Wrath
        - Deal heavy elemental damage to all foes in range. 
        - You obtain this after beating Chaos.

Filo: Wind Soul
        - Allow allies to act immediately.
        - You obtain this after beating Mateus.

Lluyd: Fanfare
        - Fortify all friendly Espers (granted an additional level).
        - You obtain this after beating Hashmal.

Balthier: Element of Treachery
        - Deal heavy damage to one foe.
        - You obtain this after beating Shemhazai.

Fran: Gaze of the Void
        - Remove buffs from all foes.
        - You obtain this after beating Exodus.

Ashe: Empyrean's Edict
        - Prevent all foes from summoning Espers.
        - You obtain this after beating Famfrit.

Basch: Apocalypse Shield
        - Nullifies all damage to leader's team in a short while.
        - You obtain this after beating Zalera.

036 - Attack Types

There are three types of attack, which act in a rock-paper-scissors
relationship.

Melee units attack at a close range. While effective against ranged units, their
attacks have difficulty reaching flying units.

Ranged units attack from a distance. Though very effective against flying units,
ranged units are little use against foes in melee range.

Flying units attack from the air. Although they can pick off melee units with 
ease, they're extremely vulnerable to ranged attacks.

037 - Natures

All attacks and Espers have a nature associated with the damage they deal. Each
unit is vulnerable to attacks of a certain nature. Attacks of this nature will 
deal additional damage. You can view each unit's weakness from the Status Screen
before battle.

Here is a list of all the different kinds and their weaknesses:

                               Nature | Weakness
                              --------+----------
                               None   |   None
                               Fire   |   Water
                               Water  |  Thunder*
                              Thunder |  Ground**
                              Ground  |   Fire
                              Healing |   None

* The exception is Shivan, Shivar, and Shiva, who are weak to fire. There are 
also enemies with a water (but ice really) nature who are weak to fire.

** The exception is Remora and Ramih, who are weak to water.

038 - Summoning 101

Groups
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before we talk about summoning, it is important to know about group leaders. 
Party members who accompany you in battle are referred to as group leaders. Up 
to five group leaders can join a mission. Some missions may require that certain
party members be present.

A group is made up of its leader and the Espers under his control. Each group
leader can control up to eight Espers.

Gates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now to summoning gates. These are portals that open on the World of Illusion. 
These gates enable their controller to summon Espers. You must control a 
summoning gate in order to use it. Blue gates are gates that you control, red 
gates are controlled by your enemies, and colorless gates are neutral gates that
have not been captured.

Move a group leader to a neutral or enemy-controlled summoning gate to capture 
it. Espers cannot capture summoning gates. Be aware that enemies will try to 
capture gates as well.

Touching a blue summoning gate will bring up the following commands: Summon, 
Fortify Espers, and Queue. Certain requirements must be met before the Fortify 
Espers command becomes available.

Commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select Summon and choose the group to which the Esper will be assigned. Then, 
select which Esper to summon. Touch the Summon command repeatedly to summon the 
previously selected Esper.

Select Queue to view the Espers being summoned through the gate. Touch an Esper
in the queue twice to cancel the summon.

Select Fortify Espers to temporarily raise the level of all allied Espers. Each
fortification raises the Espers' levels by one, up to a maximum of five. Each
successive fortification requires more Astral Power (AP). AP can be used to
fortify your Espers, temporarily raising their level. The first fortification 
consumes one unit of AP, the second two, etc.

Some Espers can use magicks and abilities. A list of each Esper's magicks and 
abilities can be found on the Status Screen. Select an Esper to bring up the 
Magicks/Abilities command.

Select an Esper and use the Dismiss command to return the Esper to the World of
Illusion. The battle party's Affinity determines the number of Espers you can 
have summoned at once.

Affinity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The battle party's Affinity is the total of each group leader's Affinity. If the
Affinity bar is full, you cannot summon more Espers. Controlling higher-ranked 
Espers costs more Affinity. This is an Esper's summoning cost. Balance the 
strength and cost of Espers when forming your battle party. When an Esper falls 
in battle or is dismissed, the Affinity used to control it becomes available 
again after a short time.

Pacts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to summon a particular Esper, you must make a pact with it. Forging 
a pact with an Esper requires an amount of auracite equal to its rank. There is
no particular benefit to amassing auracite, so it is best to forge pacts early 
and often.

Espers with which pacts can be formed glow yellow on the Ring of Pacts. You can 
form a pact with an Esper once the Esper adjacent to it is enlisted, moving from
the inside of the ring outward. Some Espers only become available once certain 
conditions are met.

Troupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regardless of how may pacts you've forged, you cannot summon more than five 
types of Espers in a battle. That set of Espers is an Esper Troupe. New Espers 
must be assigned to a troupe using the Modify command before you can summon 
them. You can create up to three troupes for use in different situations.

At the start of battle, group leaders are assigned Espers from the selected 
troupe that match their attack type. Starting Espers are indicated by a crystal 
icon on the Battle Party Screen.

039 - Other Basics

Here are some more game elements that will be helpful to review:

Foraging: Some battlefields contain Foraging Points, locations at which a group 
leader can forage for food to restore the HP of all members of his group.

Scavenging: Many valuable resources lie strewn across the battlefields you 
discover. Group leaders can scavenge these resources, recovering items for later
use.

Soul Crystals: Possess the power to revive fallen group leaders. Destroying 
enemy soul crystals is often the key to victory.

World Map: You can access menus and functions using the icons in the bottom-
right corner of the World Map Screen.
      - Menu Icon: Opens the Party Menu. You can also open the Party Menu by 
        pressing the X button.
      - Tomaj Icon: Talk to Tomaj to undertake an expedition. Functions 
        identically to the notice board on the airship's bridge.
      - Airship Icon: Opens the Airship Menu, from which you can board or
        disembark the airship.
      - Named locations on the World Map mark battlefields and other points of
        interest. Locations containing missions that advance the story are 
        marked with a flag.

Melee Battles: Entering a location not marked by a flag allows for melee battles
with unbound Yarhi or freebooting sky pirates. If you reach an encounter where 
enemies are too powerful, use melee battles to raise your characters' levels.

                              040 - General Tips
                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This section contains helpful advice for beginner players while completing the 
missions. I really hope my list will assist you for some battles:

- Always review the stats, attack types, and nature of all your opponents before
  battle. This is because you may a) realize your characters are not a high 
  enough level to win, b) your characters could be emphasized on one attack type
  that the enemy is strong against, and c) you may be weak to the nature that 
  the majority of the enemies are under.

- Always check areas around before proceeding to the next storyline fight in 
  case there is an optional battle available! That way you can obtain auracite, 
  extra leveling, and miscellaneous items.

- Also, be SURE to talk to everyone on the airship before completing another 
  storyline mission. If you have, talk to them twice. This is because they can 
  trigger new missions and cutscenes.

- If you have extra materials from scavenging that you will probably never use, 
  then sell it. Especially the low grades. At some point you will run out of 
  room in your inventory, and instead of being able to sell the item you will 
  have to discard something. I would say no more than three of any low grade 
  material should be carried around by you.

- Before you approach a "boss" or the hardest enemy in the area, don't forget to
  give your characters a quick buff-up using Penelo's dances, etc. This can make
  all the difference during a tough battle. Although sometimes you will not have
  a window of opportunity to do this, so don't bother if it means costing you a 
  few seconds or a precious heal with Penelo.

- Check Tomaj's missions! You can find all sorts of things, including the Espers
  from the first game and more auracite. It makes the game run longer as well, 
  so you'll play more for your money with these optional missions.

- Instead of buying weapons, try to craft them as much as you can. This is 
  because they are made differently (usually better), it's fun to rename a 
  weapon if you wish, and also some missions only appear once you have crafted a
  certain number of items. Don't hesitate!

- Although the battlefield can often become very hectic, sometimes it is better 
  to have your party split into two groups to fight two different fronts. Use 
  the stylus to maneuver a group together. Usually it is better to stick 
  together, but there are a few occasions where separate is good, which I will 
  point out when the time comes.

- Pay attention during the starting screen before a battle where it gives the 
  info about whether or not a summoning gate is provided on the field. If not, 
  change a rank III Esper down to a rank II.

- Most attacking characters will have multiple excellent attack abilities. Since
  you can only set one as a gambit, don't forget about the others. This is 
  especially true for Kytes, whose abilities are mostly magick attacks.

- Try not to have too many melee attackers on the field. This is because many 
  times they will be left trying to walk over to the enemy between a crowded 
  field, which wastes important attack time. The game is bad with not allowing 
  them room to fit in with the rest there. Ranged attackers do not need to worry
  about this problem. Keep in mind that this tip is mostly for boss fights.

- Always take your time picking off minor enemies before going for the MAIN 
  guy. The minor enemies can be VERY annoying when you're trying to focus on the
  main boss and the Espers keep wanting to focus their attention elsewhere.

- Before you battle, check out the enemy list to see if any can give you certain
  status effects. If you fight something and die because of these effects, 
  consider buying one of Tomaj's accessories that deal specifically with this 
  matter. It can make all the difference.

- Check carefully how many enemy leaders there are supposed to be before you 
  start the battle. If one is mysteriously gone and you don't remember killing 
  him or her, s/he could have possibly performed a Vanishing spell.

- Do NOT complete the Ring of Pacts for one or two groups of natures. Spread it 
  out to keep the variety between your party. You'll never know which nature 
  type you'll need next.

- I strongly, strongly recommend always having Lluyd in your party. This is 
  because he is the only other person than Penelo who can Raise someone (though
  for a small HP sacrifice). If he is not in your party and Penelo dies, you're
  in big trouble there.

- If you forget how to do something, or if you're not sure what a certain term 
  means, remember that the Primer in the menu offers helpful advice and also an
  explanation about certain game elements.

Not too complicated, in most cases. Well, that's about all the beginning stuff
I have, let's get one with the rest already...remember, although I said it 
before I'll say it now too--I will explain side/melee missions in the chapter 
section they appear, not in a separate place.

| Here we find Vaan wandering by himself. A flan approaches, and a tutorial of |
| the game begins. "You must get past the flan to proceed." Then the game      |
| launches into details about controlling, moving, and attacking. Anyway, do   |
| what it instructs. Vaan will be quite proud of his accomplishment of killing |
| the lone flan. Whatever. Next, find Penelo. She's straight ahead. You will   |
| need to kill another flan first. Yay, we found her. The game will go on to   |
| explain that Penelo heals only in this version and a short explanation about |
| handling multiple units.                                                     |

| Time to find Balthier and Fran. You will have to kill THREE flans (=o!) Then |
| after a little bit more of walking Vaan finds them. They will enter together |
| and the mission is completed. Vaan and Penelo will level up.                 |
|                                                                              |

Now we reach a cutscene. The crew has found some treasure. But oh noes, there's 
trouble. Seems as though Ifrit decided to show up...

| Here we go. This battle is so easy you don't even have to do anything except |

After the battle our heroes quickly realize the whole place will soon cave in. 
This leads to the separation of Balthier and Fran from Vaan and Penelo, and also
the beginning of the first chapter.

Here we are introduced to Milo, Kytes, and Tomaj. Then a cutscene involving a 
falling airship. Hmm. Sounds like mission time.

| Treasure is all well and good for sky pirates, but it meas little enough     |

| Ugh, another stupid tutorial battle. Oh well. This is good practice. Now we  |

| Kytes, and the Alraune by Filo. They'll fall quickly. You pretty much don't  |

| This battle can be hard for beginners. First of all you may summon one extra |

For obvious reasons everyone leaves the room. Vaan takes off after Penelo and 
Tomaj meet up with the rest. Ba'Gamnan seems to tag along too. Once they reach 
the sky, a new chapter begins.

Chapter 1 complete!

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
                               200 - Chapter Two
                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Time to name the new airship. You can pick whatever you want. The default is The
Galbana. Then a tutorial will explain things about talking and shopping--just 
interaction in general. Try it out now. Talk to Penelo twice to hear different
things. Then talk with Filo twice to take off.

Yay, another tutorial about piloting the airship. -_- This is in case you are a 
total airhead who's never played a game ever. Once you land, a cutscene will 
occur. It's off to a place called:

The Bosco Pampa - Verdant flatland broken by patches of sky. Well-preserved 
ruins dot the plain, attestation to an ancient civilization that survives to 
this day.

So yeah, as it turns out this guy's name is Lluyd. From now on he is a permanent
member of the party. Another cutscene with him explaining stuff. You may equip 
the vest and the rod. Fane of Gucuma Qul has become available. In case you're 
wonder what the manual is for, we'll get to that shortly. First another tutorial
about world map navigation. Also don't forget to equip the new guy's gambit.

Before we head over to the new area, let's go back to where we just completed 
the previous mission. A Monster Melee fight has become available. Head back to 
areas frequently to see if you missed a free fight.

Now it's time to examine newest place:

Fane of Gucuma Qul: August temple enshrining auracite, stones held sacred above 
all else on Lemures. Carven wings soar above the temple, catching the sun and 
instilling peace and awe on all who make pilgrimage here.

You will now be able to use the Ring of Pacts. Very important. Anyway, the job's
not done yet. Equip the sword, staff, and pouch, enlist the White Hare into 
your party using the Ring of Pacts along with two others, adjust your Troupe 
accordingly, and enter the same place once again.

| No summoning gates for this battle. I should note that once you open some of |

| Defeating the area with the mage moogle is tough, I'd say it's better to     |
| take out his surrounding Espers first. You will probably lose an Esper in    |
| the process. Finishing that, heal, and unlock the yellow wall. Fight the     |
| Alraune, take the treasure, then go back to eventually bring down the blue   |
| wall. Fight the sky pirate here. Examine the green switch. Go back and down  |
| the hall to fight the white mage-looking guy. After that, battle more of the |
| Sagittarius to find the final treasure. Then make your way to the flag.      |

| ...Only to find that it was a trap! Great, Espers are gone. You'll have to   |
| do this the old fashioned way. It's too bad you can't use Bombs, as Titan is |
| weak against Fire. At least there's still Kytes. Make use of his Firaga move |
| while fighting. Not long into battle, Ba'Gamnan will show up...and help! He  |
| will make the fight much more beatable. If someone falls, have Lluyd perform |
| his Revive move, which he should have learned by now.                        |

| on your Esper amount and replenish when they die (because they will).        |
| Eventually you should just be at the point to where you must try and rush    |
| the enemy crystal. If the whole party is there, healers and all, you will be |

Equip your new found Medallion. Unlock more Espers, blah blah blah. Now launch 
the airship and head over to the next storyline place. Which is:

The Kisne Rise: The roots of the great skystone jut from this gently sloping 
hill. The skystone's Mist tempers the climate, and in spring the hillside is a 
riot of color as its rich grasses give way to a sea of flowers.

him. The Sky Saloon is still not available at this time. In addition, you should
already have all of the weapons and armor he offers. The only thing new is the 
Accessory tab, which should be: Winged Boots, Corsage Bracelet, Traveler's 
Pouch, Gold Earrings, Gauntlets, and Mythril Gloves. Check my Tomaj's Shop part 
of the guide to see the full list available at this point and their prices.

Back to the Rise again. It's time for another Melee.

Okay, it's time to take the trip towards our next goal. Which happens to be:

Fane Of Tehp Qul: Central shrine on the Isle of the Megalith. A natural cave 
leads to the dais holding the auralith within, the sole auralith whose location 
is known to the aegyl.

|                   Rendezvous Round Back - Fane Of Tehp Qul                   |
|                                                                              |
| After saving the aegyl, the party heads for the shrine holding the auralith, |
| but a watch has already bee posted outside! How does Vaan plan to sneak      |
| past?                                                                        |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|               !--Sneak into the temple; Vaan must survive--!                 |
|                                                                              |
| This is a...different kind of mission. I won't bother listing the enemies    |
| and their stats. You shouldn't try to take them on. PLEASE, PLEASE remember  |
| that there are several Viera archers throughout who will cast vanishing      |
| spells on themselves. Try your best to memorize where they are before you    |
| start moving.                                                                |
|                                                                              |
| Secondly, some people forget about Vaan's abilities. I had on his Sprint     |
| Shoes when I did this, also you can set his Gambit under Sprint. This will   |
| help you. I'm sure a lot of people will be tempted by the treasure chests    |
| sprinkled throughout, but as you can see at the bottom here you'll find      |
| better things soon enough. Still, I managed to do this after casting Sprint. |
|                                                                              |
| If you don't want treasure you can make a dash towards the entrance and the  |
| mission will be completed. If you want all three of the chests then you will |
| probably be caught, so be prepared to lose some health. If you did what I    |
| told you by completing everything else (aka training) up until this point,   |
| you will last.                                                               |

| So as far as the first half of this goes...the Judge will approach you fast. |
| Therefore, it is probably better to stay where you are and wait. This way    |
| you won't have other enemies to deal with. Then we need to take care of the  |
| rank III Esper Shiva. She is weak to fire, so...keep that in mind. The other |
| enemies will approach throughout, so I would wait until the coast is all     |
| clear before approaching Shiva. Save Kyte's Firaga spell.                    |

Immediately after you will read a quick explanation of AP. You can now powerup 
your Espers once you have battle enough enemies. Neat.

Unfortunately we have yet another battle to undergo before the end of this 
chapter. It seems as though our loveable Bangaa has met up with his group...

Gijuk will give a tip, saying that the Judge of Wings went to the "Skysea." 
Whatever that means. At least we can leave this place now.

Chapter 3 Complete!

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
                               400 - Chapter Four
                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

We begin this chapter with Tomaj showing you around the newly accessible Sky 
Saloon. There are four shops around here. Check their sections of my walkthrough
to learn more. When you can control Vaan, fiddle with the Ring of Pacts.

Now let's look around. To the left is Penelo's shop, above her is Llyud's shop 
where you can purchase materials for crafting, right of him is a funky little 
dude called Namingway who can rename the airship, to the right of THAT is Cu 
Sith's craft shop, and below is Tomaj's weapon, etc shop. If you speak to Lluyd
after Tomaj explains what he's doing there he'll say something funny ( I thought
so anyway).

These are the new weapons etc. he has that you shouldn't right now: Flametongue,
Rod of Lightning, Rod of Ice, Ruby Chestplate, Bard's Tunic, Hermit's Robes, 
Survival Vest, Steel Gorget, Battle Boots, and the Goblin Pouch. I recommend you
at least buy the pouch.

The material shop Lluyd runs sells low-grade only right now. You shouldn't have 
just the Pink Silver and Peridot at this point. Don't buy anything though, you 
will be desperate later on to sell all the crap...

I will also advise you to begin crafting things. Certain missions will only 
unlock after you have crafted a certain number of weapons, in addition to there 
being a chapter requirement. So start now. Craft everything you can.

For now, we head back to the Fane...

| This is a very tough battle at this stage of the game. First, take care of   |
| the enemy right above you. Then go east and attack there, sealing everything |
| on the way and getting the scavenge items. Then return to the first summon   |
| gate and defend, gathering your troops again and fortifying them. Make sure  |
| you have plenty of White Hares for this one. There are a variety of natures  |
| but the majority are weak towards fire. Summon Espers that correspond.       |
|                                                                              |
| When you reach the top things become a bit tricky. Try to reach the third    |
| gate as soon as you can after taking care of the first wave of Golem. You    |
| need to seal that off. After that, recover again and rush over to the soul   |
| crystal. Don't bother trying to seal the last gate. This will probably take  |
| several tries. Utilize Kytes' abilities as much as possible. Keep summoning  |
| fresh Espers to aid you in the fight.                                        |
|                                                                              |
| If I were you, I would summon Bombs and Lamia for this battle. Not only are  |
| the Lamia fire in nature, but they can confuse enemies. As for Bombs, you    |
| can self-destruct them once you reach the third summon gate and quickly      |
| summon them again. Very handy...                                             |

| I hope you all read the enemy info correctly--the Minotaur is at twice the   |
| level of everything else. Sooo proceed with extreme caution. Obviously units |
| that are flyers will be of big help. First take care of the Rock Wolf to the |
| right and gather the items found nearby. Once you kill the Green Wyrms...a   |
| lone Minotaur should approach, which triggers a whoooole group of them to    |
| shortly follow. All I can say is that it reallly helps to have at least one  |
| type of rank II flyers here. I also really like Lamia to confuse them and I  |
| also had Golem to immobilize.                                                |

| That aside it should be fairly straightforward...there is another group of   |
| high leveled Minotaur next to the timber, but I just avoided those, so try   |
| not to attract their attention as some of your Esper will be down for the    |
| count. Gather the remaining materials.                                       |

Acquire an Esper or two from the Auracite you should have just gained. There are
no more of Tomaj's side missions, so now we need to tackle a storyline mission. 
Board the airship and travel to the skysea.

Port Marilith: Breathtaking port overlooking the skysea. It is customary for the
aegyl to travel the skysea by ship rather than fly, and the port bustles with 
travelers.

Make your way over to Rikken and speak with him. Once the dialogue is over, 
return to Penelo and speak with her. More cutscenes, and it seems as though you 
will be participating in the contest. Now canoe over to:

Isshu, Jewel Of The SkySea: Island paradise where aegyl crossing the skysea 
often sojourn. The crystal-blue waters and shimmering white beaches offer 
welcome to the weary wayfarer.

| Yeah...the main thing to worry about is grabbing the treasure. The others    |
| should be okay--in fact, they'll be your rivals for this. What will REALLY   |

| and making them fight those things. I would also suggest splitting up into   |
| two separate groups at some point. Maybe one person mine the bones while the |

| mined the crystal. And then my other person traveled to find the Emerald.    |

Hmm, seems as though we received one piece of auracite after the battle, along 
with another crafting book. So go back to the Sky Saloon and check out what Cu 
Sith has to offer.

Now it is time for another Monster Melee battle.

Forge a new pact with an Esper and equip the new wand if it is not better than

Now we must move on to the next mandatory mission. Prepare by forging what you 
can, if you have not done so already. It will be of great help.

Yapih Caverns: A scalding cavern of lava and flame rising from a rocky 
outcropping extending to the southeast of the skysea. Ruins fill the cavern, 
forming a crude trail to the temple hidden deep within.

| Yeah so your three favorite allies will be helping you here. Personally I    |

Equip the armlet if you would like and take care of the auracite you received if
you can.

If you haven't already I suggest buying the Ruby Chestplate for Vaan.

| stays alive so that once everything dies down he can revive people. Before   |
| you confront Belias Penelo should perform a dance to increase strength and   |
| Kytes should have Blizzaga ready for the group surrounding him.              |

For the time being you cannot access the saloon or any of the newest of Tomaj's
missions. Add a new Esper to your collection if you can. Three new areas will 
become available. Although you cannot return to the airship you can still buy 
things from Tomaj at the camp. New equipment is available. Let's begin a Melee 
to start things out.

Zwaua Rainwood: Rare and splendid Yarhi crawl through the dense tropical brush 
in the hidden depths of the wood. They do not readily welcome outsiders.

| We have a general weakness towards fire here. Avoid Titan for now and try to |

| the beginning you can also have your flyers go over to take the summon gate  |
| as a bit of a shortcut. Don't need to, though. Make your way back to Titan   |
| after grabbing the scavenge items, etc. Prep everyone with Penelo's dances   |
| and attack. Vaan's Quickening might appear, so take advantage if it does.    |

A new area is now available on the map.

Gugoza Falls: Majestic waterfall set at the heart of the Greendeep. The water's 
misty spray refreshes and revitalizes, but the direct force of the cascade can 
be crushing.

| Yeah, this one is tough. Basically what you need to do is stay in the middle |
| of the area and wait for the monsters to come to you (or you can go to them  |
| if there's time, but that isn't recommended for too many occasions). Use all |
| of Kytes's spells when he can. Have Penelo increase magick and strength. You |
| must continuously fortify Espers and summon new ones. Heal Velis if he is    |
| under attack and never, ever leave him for too long. If all else fails, try  |
| to have Vaan's Quickening ready once the Great Malboro appears.              |
|                                                                              |

| Ugh...no Penelo for this mission. That means a few things. First, you cannot |

| will give back much needed HP. Secondly, you should dismiss at least one or  |
| two of your Espers and replace them with a White Hare (Carbuncle?). Lastly,  |
| The Judge of Wings will NOT attack you, so long as you do not approach her.  |
| Wait until Velis comes towards you. If you fight the lesser enemies with     |
| Vaan a lot you might just gain his Quickening. You don't even need to take   |
| away all his health, the battle will end before that point. There is no way  |
| to take back Penelo's health unless you summon a healing thing. Watch her    |
| carefully because the enemies will keep trying to attack her.                |

A cutscene begins. Tomaj is excited because the airship has finally been fixed. 
How he knew how to fix an airship that is from another place I'll never know.

Chapter 5 Complete!

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
                               600 - Chapter Six
                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Talk to Cu Sith and Tomaj at the beginning of this chapter. If you've been 
crafting things Cu will have a new mission for you to complete. Tomaj will also 
have one for you. If you talk with Lluyd he'll mention the first price discount 
of the game. Things will now cost five percent less than before. Lastly, speak 
with Penelo to unlock yet another mission (involving food).

Go to the Bridge for a cutscene. After that, launch the airship. There are many
different things we can do at this point, but right now I wish to have those 
pesky melee missions out of the way.

Time to move on. There's a newly unlocked area by the skysea.

Oghu, the Veiled Isle: Mysterious island revealed by the skysea's destruction. 
The aegyl dare not approach for fear they should disturb the Lord of the Seas 
said to dwell thereon.

Gee, I wonder who this Lord of the Seas could be. >_>

| In case you haven't noticed, most of the enemies are weak towards lightning. |

| you. He'll cause more trouble later. Seal off his gate. Then go after the    |
| Ninja, who will be in the area, and the Warmage, who will approach. Go to    |
| her gate and seal that off too, collecting the crystal items. You probably   |
| have noticed by now that Flyers have an easy time cutting across paths. So I |
| used this to send Filo and Lluyd to scavenge the northwest bones. After you  |
| seal off the other western gate this should become easier. Don't forget to   |
| fortify. Thunder-nature Espers, again, will really, really help you.         |

Okay, it is at this point in the game that I would recommend selling certain low
grade materials. Otherwise you'll end up discarding them with no money back. 
Sell enough so you have only 4 or 5 of something (the low grade). After that go
a bit northeast of the skysea.

Underfane of Huin Qul: Sister of the shrine destroyed with the skysea. The 
balance of auracite held within the shrines--one of fire, one of water--
preserved the balance of the skysea. With one lost, the skysea could not long 
last.

For the moment, if you choose to craft some weapons with the Everburn, to hold 
off on equipping them. This is because we'll be facing a water enemy soon. It is
not essential to have these new weapons until then. On the other hand, you can 
craft them and equip it for other fights, but just be sure to switch for another
thing if you are not that powerful.

|             !--Defeat Ultima; at least one ally must survive--!              |
|                                                                              |
|                        Mandatory Characters: Penelo                          |
|                                                                              |
| This is a very, very hard battle. It is also the first I recommend using     |
| Carbuncles. If you fail within the first few tries I would recommend going   |
| to different missions available and leveling up some more. Set both Penelo's |
| Raise and Lluyd's Revive as gambits! And be sure to have Penelo cast her     |
| spells that increase strength and magick right before you encounter Ultima.  |
| And if you attack behind Ultima you will be able to avoid her very powerful  |
| attack, although that is very hard to maneuver. My recommended Espers are:   |
| Shivan (meh), Cuchulainn, Carbuncle, and Siren. The last one can be whatever |
| you want, really. Don't bother with Vaan's Quickening, there's not enough    |
| time, usually. It'll only happen if you can survive for long enough, or if   |
| you equip the Germinas Boots (maybe, haven't tried that).                    |
|                                                                              |
| Lastly, there is one "trick" I have learned that can help you greatly. There |
| are two summoning gates to either side. Ahead of the downward-right one is a |
| rock. Hopefully you can see what I'm talking about. If you stand just so     |
| behind it then Ultima's attacks will not be able to reach you. Obviously     |
| you'll need to use Melee people as bait while your Ranged fighters hammer    |
| away. This can take a little time to perfect. I managed to beat Ultima using |
| characters in the 27 level range with this trick.                            |
|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                              |
| Final Items: Healing Armlet, Auracite                                        |
| Goblin Pouch: Fire Magicite, Fire Crystal                                    |

You can now use Penelo's Quickening. Additionally, Ultima is an Esper you may 
summon. She is of the healing type of course. Return everyone's gambits to the 
way they were and equip the Armlet if you so choose. Reform your Espers to face
Water-natured things...

| Ramuh is a recommended Esper to summon here (obviously). This is a GREAT     |

| have Lluyd Jump and Wyvern/Kytes perform their far-away fire moves to get    |
| rid of a good chunk of the Golems' HP. Also once you see Hashmal approaching |

Cool, we now have Lluyd's Quickening. And Hashmal is unlocked on the ring. Neat.
Well, that's it for optional missions right now. We've put off the inevitable. 
It's time to tackle those storyline things.

Heaven's Vigil: The aegyl stage their watch of the Ymir Qul from this quiet 
village. Legend holds that the sacred mountain lies at the foot of the heavens, 
the stairway fallen aegyl must ascend to reach the afterlife.

Enter the place and speak with Fran. A short dialogue will occur. After this 
move to the next place, which is...

The Ymir Qul Range: Holy peaks higher than aegyl wings can soar. Jagged skystone
claws at the sky along its twisting paths, while sheer cliffs stand their silent
watch, unforgiving of those who would trespass.

Yay, Fran joined your party! You're probably wondering right now whether or not 
you should kick someone else out and fit her in. Well I'd say yes, and I'd make 
it Filo. She doesn't really have anything special going on for her.

I'm glad that's over with. Let's continue on with the storyline missions. Head 
up on the world map.

Ymir Qul Underground: Cavern that descends to the foundation of the sacred 
mountain, attainable only by those who first conquer its heights. Within beats 
the very heart of the mountain.

| This is an...interesting battle. Not only do you have Fran/Balthier to worry |
| about, but that pesky Ba'Gamnan guy showed up. Since those two hate each     |
| other, they WILL fight one another. This means the best way to deal with his |
| team is to send Espers over to the left under Lluyd's Vanishga spell. The    |
| best is a rank III Esper. Lead Ba'Gamnan over to where Balthier is. After he |
| is out of the way you're free to take his summoning gate. After that it's a  |
| matter of dealing with Balthier and Fran. Vaan should obtain his Quickening  |
| somewhere in there, so make use of it. Lots of Sagittarius will show up. If  |
| you're not comfortable fighting that area yet send more Espers up to clear   |
| the field for you. And summon at least four Carbuncles just in case.         |
|                                                                              |

More scenes follow. Things become a little confusing.

Chapter 6 Complete!

                              700 - Chapter Seven
                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The End of Dreams: Currents of dense Mist coil and whirl here, where Vaan first 
awoke in this realm. Vespterine light stirs a longing for home.

Lots and lots of scenes. What you need to do and where you need to move is 
pretty self-explanatory. Watch Penelo, Kytes, and Filo. Move to where Lluyd is 
and speak to him. Approach Balthier/Fran. After another short scene approach the
Alraune. The world map will appear. Approach the left area.

Illusion's Home: Waves of Mist radiate from this secluded spring, lapping at the
blooming flowers of remembrance. Herein all creatures revisit their home. It is 
the place of birth and return for all Yarhi.

go to the right on the map.

The Neverwood: Dark forest of the Yarhi where shadow and shade chase through 
perpetual twilight. Shifting trees and softly flickering stones animate this 
surreal wood.

I'm happy we're finished with these for now. Vaan needs to return to the End of 
Dreams so we can return to the other world and all that stuff.

After a scene, approach the little Alraune group. Now go to Illusion's Home.

After several scenes the whole group will be back inside the airship. There's no
time to think, though. Gotta fight one more battle in this chapter. Go around 
the Sky Saloon and buy things if you wish. I also took this opportunity to sell
my excess materials. Go to the bridge and speak with Balthier.

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

A royal airship will approach. Lolz who could it be!? Once you gain control, 
head up to where the Leviathan is. If you touch that airship you can descend 
back down to Ivalice. Finally, all your party members are accounted for.

Talk to everyone on the airship. Penelo will have another mission available once
you speak with her. So will Cu and Nono. Lluyd will offer a discount and fresh 
materials. Tomaj has some new equipment worth looking at.

Let's begin with a simple summoning melee.

| Now I know I don't need to tell you that Ground Espers will be of help here. |
| Capture the left gate, summon your rank III Esper (I chose Hashmal). Vaan is |

| Shemmy until you have this. You'll also want to fight this boss near the     |
| upper-right summon gate, obviously. Have Penelo perform her dances whenever  |
| you can. This may take a few tries.                                          |

|______________________________________________________________________________|

Here's a hint, each time there's a mandatory character it means they're about to
earn their Quickening. >_> In this case Balthier. Neat. Also equip his armor 
because it's probably better than what you have. Let's acquire one more scion 
before we leave the skies...

Ring if you can. Time for a mandatory battle.

Dalmasca Estersand: Desert lying east of the Royal City of Rabanastre. Numerous 
trade routes cross the desert sands, but recent Yarhi attacks have made commerce

| Espers continuously and stop anyone who tries to approach your crystal.      |

Once back at the airship, speak with everyone to learn more about the situation.
Places will unlock for you to visit. Now speak with Cu...she should tell you 
about a new Tomaj mission if you've crafted enough things. Time to check that 
out before continuing.

...Also if you speak to Fran, you'll see a short scene with Ashe and Balthier.

Now that we've taken care of this we can concentrate on mandatory missions. I 
like to finish Giza Plains because it's annoying.

Giza Plains: Savannah to the south of the Royal City of Rabanastre, currently in
the Dry. Members of the Rabanstre watch have been dispatched to patrol the 
plains amid reports of Yarhi sightings.

| brief lull in the enemies, head over to Zalera. He doesn't have as much HP   |
| as you'd suspect. As for your party...you need at LEAST Penelo and Lluyd so  |
| that they can revive people. I like Kytes for his abilities and quickening,  |
| which can wipe out the Vampyr in front of Zally. Basch is mandatory, so the  |
| last character is up to you (Vaan's quickening is good). The rest is luck.   |
|                                                                              |

Now Basch has his quickening. Awesome. Now all we need is Ashe's...also, Zalera 
has been unlocked on the Ring. Check that out.

| I recommend taking the middle gate first. Things will just become chaotic    |
| otherwise. You NEED to take all the gates to make this mission run as best   |
| as possible. I suggest the center, then southeast, then southwest, then      |
| northeast, then northwest. For me Mydia always approached me when I was at   |
| the northwest gate, so save that until the very last. She has a move that'll |
| basically do massive damage, so be near a gate to immediately resummon your  |
| Carbuncles. And take care of her Lamia! They'll be a pain if left alone. I   |
| summoned as many Carbuncle as I possibly could, so you may try that. Also, I |
| recommend have Lluyd's and Penelo's gambit set to their revival abilities.   |
|                                                                              |

Now that we're done with that mission, you probably want to take on the rest of
the side missions, right? Wrong. You're not ready yet. The easiest fight is the
one against Bahamut and the like, and there's no way you can win that battle
unless you're a) really, really lucky, or b) you've trained and crafted the best
weapons you can at this point. I think we should opt for the latter choice.

First you should concentrate on gathering the highest grade craft materials, so
that you can train simultaneously. Don't waste time with weapons for people who
already have their ultimates, though. Here's a list of what you should have at 
this point for your characters:
        - Kytes (if crafted--to me that's the Zeus Mace)
        - Filo's Vortex
        - Balthier's Formalhaut
        - Fran's Sagittarius
        - Ashe's Volcano

That's not to say something you craft cannot turn out to be more powerful, 
however. So experiment around with things. For right now, I'd make the best that
you can with Cu's Forbidden Grimoire book. So train while hunting down materials
in various places. See materials section for more details.

I'd also recommend double-checking Tomaj's shop for any armor you may need to 
purchase that is stronger than what you may have currently.

|                                                                              |
|           !--Defeat the scions; at least one ally must survive--!            |
|                                                                              |
| I only listed the starting rank III Esper, but there are lots more. As we    |
| can see, the regular Espers have fire-weaknesses, so exploit that. I used    |
| Bomb, Shivan, Balasa, Carbuncle of course, and Zalera because...I just like  |
| him, I dunno. Next, let's talk characters. Basch is amazing with his Shining |
| Ray move. It'll pwn everything. I recommend that for a gambit. Kytes is also |
| very helpful, I set his gambit to Charge and then mainly kept my eye on him  |
| and what spells he could cast. Penelo and Lluyd should both be here, with    |
| their gambits set to their Revival abilities. The last char is up to you (I  |
| used Balthier because it's not good to have more than one melee character,   |
| they take up too much space and waste time).                                 |
|                                                                              |
| First I recommend taking the southern-east gate. After that, summon the rank |
| III and proceed as fast as you can to the west gate. Take care of the Goblin |
| things there (shouldn't be hard). And take the gate. Then the Shivan group   |
| should approach. After that, take care of the Carbuncle/Golem group (do NOT  |
| approach the Titan group yet, go around). If you don't, the Carbuncles are   |
| much more of a pain later. When you feel ready, Shell, Protect, and raise    |
| Strength and Magick.                                                         |
|                                                                              |
| BEFORE you defeat Titan, capture the gate. This is very, very important. And |
| then resummon when necessary. Fortify if you get the chance. Ramuh, Shiva,   |
| Ifrit, and Bahamut will appear, in that order. At some point you should have |
| quickenings appearing. Kytes's is very, very helpful for Bahamut's group of  |
| minions. Carbuncles are annoying, try to take them out. And keep your own    |
| supply of Carbuncles up. Fortify them before all the others.                 |
|                                                                              |
| Lastly, there's a little trick I'd like to mention to you. Titan will NOT    |
| approach you before you attack him. So this means you can be a little sneaky |
| using Lluyd. Have your whole party stay near the left gate. Then have Lluyd  |
| attack using his jump move and then RUN back to the party. Titan should walk |
| over to you here. If Lluyd is under immobilize, have Penelo close to get rid |
| of that. Being in this location can save you precious seconds of heal and    |
| recover time. I chose the left gate because Ramuh is not that bad, unlike    |
| Shiva. Have Kytes be a little daring in the beginning by leaving him under   |
| attack for a short while to build his quickening for Bahamut's group.        |
|                                                                              |
| When it was all said and done I managed to win with a level 55 party (barely |
| though). I don't recommend that however, try to train at least to 60.        |
|                                                                              |

|                                                                              |

| Goblin Pouch: Water Crystal, Water Gem                                       |

...And we now have Bahamut on the Ring. Not surprising. In addition we've been 
given several neat new weapons, armor, and an accessory that you may equip if 
you wish. Two more Espers left.

| ...It's too bad we don't have any dark masks to nullify that Final Eclipse   |
| move this time...sigh. Well, a lot of my character strategy is similar to    |
| Bahamut's fight--gambits and all. Check that so I don't repeat myself.       |
|                                                                              |
| Now the important thing to remember here is that Zodiark will never actively |
| seek you out and attack, so the first part of this battle should be pretty   |
| obvious in capturing the gates. Then, stay in the middle and wait for the    |
| enemies to approach you. Use this time to obtain quickenings and fortify the |
| Espers (I used Bahamut for this fight, naturally). I also recommend Golems   |
| and Lamias. This is a matter of personal preference though.                  |
|                                                                              |
| Now onto Zodiark himself. My strategy was as follows: have Bahamut be part   |
| of Basch's group. Then summon as many Golems/whatever under him so he has a  |
| total of eight things (maybe one Carbuncle as well). Then while the party is |
| in the center, send Bahamut and anything else Basch has in his group to      |
| Zodiark. Right before they attack, have him perform his quickening which can |
| make them totally immune to damage for a short period. While they are there  |
| and attacking things (hopefully mainly Zodiark), his quickening will quickly |
| build again. Rinse and repeat. If he doesn't obtain it again right away, you |
| only need to simply resummon and continue it again. Don't bring the main     |
| party near him. Using this strategy I defeated him around level 60.          |
|                                                                              |

| Gilgamesh - Greatest swordsman in all Ivalice. He insist he knows what he's  |
| doing.                                                                       |

| Bleh, this is so easy compared to the previous two battles. You may only     |
| have three characters and no Espers on the field. I chose Basch with Shining |
| Ray gambit, Penelo with her Curaga gambit, and Kytes with his Flare gambit.  |
| When it comes time to approach Gilgamesh, Basch should probably cast Protect |
| and maybe eventually use his quickening. My party was the same level as he   |
| was at this point, so no trouble at all.                                     |

I'm glad that's over with. Now to the longest battle in the game. Prepare your
weapons, armor, and accessories.

Note that you can save between each battle. I'd take advantage of that.

| This makes things hard because there are so many enemy leaders. What I did   |
| is I took the first gate to the left, then killed the center leader, and     |
| then I made a mad dash for their crystal.                                    |
|                                                                              |

| No summon gates here, so replace the rank III. I chose Golems and Shivars,   |
| but other things like Lamia can work well. Great Malboro will spawn in the   |
| center, first one, then two, and so on. I cast Shell each time (and also     |
| Bravery) before taking the bombs on just in case. You'll need to move quick  |
| around the place. It doesn't matter which section you chose first.           |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|         !--Defeat the War-chief; at least one ally must survive--!           |
|                                                                              |
| Uhh, this is hard. Your team will be separated and you'll need to battle     |
| your way to the Seeq leader. So basically all I did was ignore everyone else |
| and simply pressed X and dashed over to the Seeq. Seemed to work well.       |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|      !--Survive the enemy onslaught; at least one ally must survive--!       |
|                                                                              |
| No gates again. Get rid of the rank III. Odin will walk in a specific path   |
| around the circle. Whatever you do, do NOT save him until the very end. Kill |
| him when there are no enemies around.                                        |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|     !--Destroy the enemy soul crystal; your soul crystal must survive--!     |
|                                                                              |
| Here we face off against our characters' "evil twins" or something. They are |
| identical to your leaders in every way. I had one leader stay behind to take |
| care of the soul crystal (I chose Basch) and the rest made their way around  |
| to the enemy soul crystal. Summon lots of Carbuncle and this should work.    |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|     !--Open all the treasure chests; at least one ally must survive--!       |
|                                                                              |
| You may only have three leaders (I picked my same from Gilgamesh's battle,   |
| Basch, Kytes, and Penelo). So basically the things around the area will be   |
| patrolling around and you need to avoid them as best you can. You absolutely |
| MUST avoid Bahamut. As you can imagine. Also, the northeast group of Espers  |
| is hiding a treasure chest since their number obscures it on the map.        |
|                                                                              |

| Gem, Water Stone, Water Gem, Fire Stone, Fire Gem, Storm Stone, Storm Gem    |
|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|      !--Capture the summoning gates; your soul crystal must survive--!       |
|                                                                              |
| Here's how I did this one. I had one person capture the northeast gate while |
| the rest stood near the soul crystal and defended it. The important thing to |
| remember is that the Tricksters have the capability to cast Vanishing spells |
| on themselves and their group. This means you'll have to keep a mental note  |
| of how many Tricksters you've killed. After I had one gate captured and some |
| leaders started to go down, I had someone go to the other gates while the    |
| rest stood guard. And you'll have to be good about standing guard because if |
| not they only need one chance to destroy the crystal (especially the ones    |
| that can create the flameball, pay special attention to them).               |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|           !--Defeat all enemies; at least one ally must survive--!           |
|                                                                              |
| You'll need to have Espers that are immune to confusion. This means anything |
| that is the lightning nature. This isn't too hard, but it'll be much easier  |
| to have Penelo's quickening when the wolves come out.                        |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|       !--Defeat all enemy leaders; at least one ally must survive--!         |
|                                                                              |
| No gates to be seen. You can breathe easy with this battle, because you can  |
| actually take your time for once. I highly suggest going counterclockwise    |
| for this circle, because then the enemy leaders will be exposed. The last    |
| two groups will approach you, so think carefully about which ones you want   |
| left. I suggest the Ninja and Champion. I recommend taking care of the Aegyl |
| and like, then going in the center, then kill the Viera, then the Moogle at  |
| his back so you might have a chance of surviving him.                        |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|             !--Defeat Yiazmat; at least one ally must survive--!             |
|                                                                              |
| It figures this guy would show up. Sigh. As in FFXII, he knows a move called |
| Death Strike, which is pretty self explanatory. So have a revival gambit     |
| ready. Surprisingly, he's at only level 70. He's also weak to ground, so I'd |
| keep that in mind. Now before you freak out, you may use the same strategy   |
| we used for Zodiark, with Basch using his shield. This time, summon Zodiark, |
| plenty of Golems, and one or two Carbuncle. Your other characters should die |
| probably, but that's alright. Lastly, you should probably focus on killing   |
| the four surrounding Carbuncle of his before attacking him.                  |
|                                                                              |

After the battle Vaan's weapon, Anastasia, will power up. If you complete this 
dungeon nine more times, its stats will max out.

You should now have all of Filo's mementos back in the Sky Saloon. Neat. Well, 
it's time to confront the final villain.

|           !--Defeat Feolthanos; at least one ally must survive--!            |
|                                                                              |
| The enemy's level depends on how much you've completed the game. If you have |
| 100%, they'll all be at level 99. Yeeeah. Here's what I recommend: The Wing  |
| Wraiths are Melee, so have Wyverns in your troupe. Melee Espers will do you  |
| no good for this fight. Then Carbuncles and Bombs and one other random rank  |
| I Esper. You can go with Rabbits if you're daring but I would not suggest to |
| do that at all. Then the rank III should probably be Zodiark if you have him |
| or Bahamut if you have him, and if not then a ranged rank III of your choice |
| (it's best to have at least one good ranged...you'll see why soon).          |
|                                                                              |
| Character gambits should look something like this: Basch's set to Shell (at  |
| least in the beginning when the right arm is still there), Lluyd's set to    |
| either Revive or Jump, Vaan's set to Dervish, Penelo's to either Holy or her |
| Raise ability, Ashe's to Comet, Balthier's to Tri-Shot, Kytes's to Charge    |
| and then watch when his abilities become available, Filo and Fran...well     |
| let's just face it, by now you should know not to use them ever.             |
|                                                                              |
| So the first thing you need to do is take out the arm with the magic staff   |
| that can hurt you regardless of where you are on the battlefield. When the   |
| battle starts, summon two Carbuncles/Rabbits under Basch (USE him for this,  |
| you'll be sorry if you don't) and as many Wyverns as you can after that. You |
| should probably summon them from the left gate, not right. Next take care of |
| the Wing Wraiths that will approach or who are already in groups.            |
|                                                                              |
| Piece of advice--do NOT continue to attack his arms when the Wing Wraiths    |
| show up. Stop and take care of them before their number becomes too much to  |
| handle. Keep careful tabs on your Esper count. FORTIFY...and keep Basch's    |
| Shell gambit up when the right arm decides to attack. Use Lluyd's quickening |
| as much as possible. Once that arms falls, this fight becomes much more      |
| manageable for now. Once you start attacking the left arm, you should change |
| Basch's gambit to Protect, probably. You won't need to worry about magickal  |
| spells for now. Continue the pain until both arms are gone.                  |
|                                                                              |
| The core is left now...things become tricky. Here is where Basch's Shield    |
| quickening will start to come into play. Set his gambit back to Shell first  |
| of all. Have Espers under his command completely fortified before you make   |
| them approach Feolthanos. Send about three Carbuncles up, the rank III, and  |
| the Wyverns. Do NOT send Basch up with them because it's too risky.          |
|                                                                              |
| After this you should know the strategy by now...before Basch's group is     |
| attacked, use his quickening so they are immune to damage. Have them attack  |
| the core while the Wing Wraiths pummel them to gain Basch's quickening again |
| for you to repeat. Meanwhile, your main party should be clear on the other   |
| side of the room, away from the middle and by a gate. Bahamut will appear on |
| the top of the stairs once Feolthano's HP has been drained 60%. He will be   |
| 30 levels higher than you. So have Basch's group turn their attention to the |
| dragon now while he continues to use his quickening. Then once he's gone,    |
| return your concentration to the core and it won't be long.                  |
|                                                                              |
| Another way to do this is to have your ranged fighters stand by the stairs   |
| and damage him from there while not being hit by his beam...I don't prefer   |
| this method though, because it's hard to get them to stand there and hit him |
| at the same time and Bahamut kinda messes that up.                           |
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |
|                  !--Defeat Feolthanos; Vaan must survive--!                  |
|                                                                              |
| Yes, there's more. Now Vaan must fight him alone. Which sucked for me since  |
| I never used Vaan after my main party arrived on the scene. Anyway, running  |
| away from Feolthanos won't do any good, you need to battle with him before   |
| your allies appear to help. Once they do, get Vaan out of the way (even if   |
| he's not underleveled, you don't want to risk him being killed). This isn't  |
| a part to worry about or anything, the allies will arrive only after Vaan    |
| has lost a certain percentage of his HP.                                     |

                   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This part of the airship first opens up at the start of Chapter 4. There are 
many useful things here, and you should talk to people frequently (it can open 
up new missions by doing so). Let's examine the different places:

081 - Material Shop

This section includes at what point certain materials become available to buy, 
how much they cost, their grade, type, description, and where you can find them.
In other words, I'm putting all this stuff in one section. After each mission I 
list the possible scavenge items you could have gotten, so also consider using 
the search feature to find what you're looking for.

Note: More in-depth stuff on these materials can be found under Equipment.

091 - FAQs for Revenant Wings

Q: My Esper troupe ranks won't move up. Two of them are staying at rank I. What 
do I need to do to fix this?

        A: Once you unlock at least 3 rank II Espers, three of the five troupe
spots will upgrade to rank II. Two of the spots will always stay at rank I. When
you unlock a rank III Esper, one spot will upgrade to a rank III. So when you 
have Espers of all ranks there should be two rank I spots, two rank II spots, 
and a rank III spot in your troupe.

Q: Should I use low grade materials and save my higher grade materials when I
craft things, or should I ignore the low grade and use the higher ones?

        A: It depends how much you scavenge and how much you value using some of
the higher grade quality. Generally though, it's okay to at least go medium. See
above to know exactly how many times you'll need a certain group of materials.

Q: I've heard that there is a New Game+ mode in Revenant Wings. Is this true?

        A: No, once you finish the game there is no mode like that. The ending
screen will show like all the other Final Fantasy games.

Q: What is the significance behind the craft master's questions?

        A: That has to do with the assigned bonuses given to the weapon (i.e., 
a bonus in strength or agility, etc). I won't make a list of all the questions 
and the bonuses that go with them, but just so you know that's what it means.

Q: Does Penelo EVER sell anything in her shop?

        A: Not that I have seen. You do need to talk with her to unlock certain 
missions, though.

Q: Which characters should I use in my party?

        A: Well for awhile it won't matter because there's only five you can 
deal with anyway. Do NOT use Ba'Gamnan in your party when he is available since 
he'll be gone soon from the group. After this, try to really spread out your 
attack types. I leave it up to you what you value more. Also, this of course 
depends on the attack type of your enemies. Generally though: Basch, Ashe, 
Lluyd, Penelo, and Kytes is my recommendation. Ashe only for Comet, really, and
Combustion. Her gambit sorta sucks. :/

Q: Which gambits for ____ player should I use?

        A: See above. It depends on what you value most and what type of battle 
situation you are in.

Q: What happens if you complete all the mandatory and optional missions?

        A: When you reach a game completion of 100%, you will be able to see the
additional ending. Note that the final confrontation, if you choose to do this, 
will have enemies at level 99. Also keep in mind that some missions will NOT 
become available after awhile, so be sure to do everything.

092 - Contact Info

sparksmf@yahoo.com is the only e-mail address that I'm going to use for this 
guide. Here are the things that I will accept:

        - Game help questions regarding this game that haven't been addressed
        - Problems/incorrect information within this guide
        - Alternative strategies with bosses ONLY
        - Anything else in general with Revenant Wings that I may need to add

Versus the things that I won't accept:

        - Attachments
        - E-mail titles that are irrelevant to this guide
        - Flames/'your guide sucks' (well then let's see you write one!)

I'm assuming my readers will use good judgment, but I've also grown far too 
accustomed in the online world for listening to idiots. When/if you send me an 
e-mail, title it with something that I know is about this game. And again, I 
will be more than happy to answer any questions, or hear about any problems or 
mistakes that this guide might have. If you ask me a question that's already in 
this walkthrough, however, I'll probably just delete your message.

093 - Credits

Here is a list of people I would like to thank now that this guide is done:

 - gamefaqs.com/CJayC: For hosting this guide.
 - Those who gave me some questions to put in the FAQs section.
 - Sean Trout: For the strategy with Yiazmat.
 - Rick: For real no reason regarding the guide at all. Oh well.
 - Square: For making the game, duh.

094 - Disclaimer/Legal Stuff

It was very painstaking to write stuff for the missions down. With this in 
mind, I'd be very unhappy if someone takes this without asking. If one of you 
readers out there see it in another place, notify me immediately. This guide 
will only be found on Gamefaqs.com.

So if you see this walkthrough there, that's okay. Otherwise, it hasn't been 
authorized for anywhere else. Thank you, and I hope this guide has helped.
