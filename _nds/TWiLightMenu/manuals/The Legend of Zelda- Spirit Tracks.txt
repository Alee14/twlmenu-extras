 *    Welcome to my Spirit Track
   *  guide. This game is the se
    the first one to take a diff
a sequel to the first DS title,
Phantom Hourglass. It is,
however, set 100 years after PH,
in the new land that Link and
Tetra found. They named it
Hyrule and established a new
kingdom there. So yes, no more
boating. In exchange, technology
has advanced since then, and the
transportation system is now by
train. Some fans have expressed
discontent at this new era for a
Zelda game, but for all intents
and purposes, technology has to
advance sometime, and it's
actually quite an awesome theme.

For most who have played it,
Spirit Tracks is considered a
vast improvement over Phantom
Hourglass. It retains the same
stylus controls, but is fine-
tuned. It has a much better
soundtrack, better dungeons, and
a better overworld. It also is
the darkest toon Zelda out
there, as far as story content
is concerned. It is also
considered by some to be the
best handheld Zelda in a long
time, so if you're a fan, this
is a must-have. Of course, if
you're reading this, you most
likely already have the game and
want help. So...

Anyway, you should know the
drill for my guides by now. Main
walkthrough, spoiler-free
walkthrough, and seperate
sections for various things like
items and upgrades. At the end
of each section in the
walkthrough, there's an item
summary to help you know what
you should have at that time.
Keep in mind that this guide was
written with the NTSC (US)
version in mind, so a lot of
names will be different if
you're playing the UK version of
the game. This guide uses ASCII
art for some things, so it's
advised to view this guide with
a fixed-width font, like Lucida
Console.

CURRENT VERSION: The guide is
considered complete. Full, in-
depth walkthrough, spoiler-free
walkthrough, and various lists
and subsections for those who
want help in specific areas. The
only thing not completed is the
Multiplayer section. It will be
updated in time as I have more
experience with Battle.

The controls are pretty much the
same here, so I'll copy-paste
the descriptions used in my
Phantom Hourglass guide.

As mentioned in the intro of the
guide, this game is completely
controlled by the DS's stylus.
From moving, attacking, to using
items. I'll detail the game's
HUD (Heads-Up Display) and how
to do various actions outside of
how to use the game's items. If
you want to know how to use the
items, check the items section.
(NOTE: The HUD description is
for when the "right-handed"
option is picked, everything is
on the opposite side for left-
handed.)

Hold the stylus at a place on
the touch screen and Link will
follow it. How far the stylus is
from him determines how fast he
goes. To slash, simply slide the
stylus a direction in front of
him. To stab, slide the stylus
away from Link. You can
specifically target enemies with
slashes by tapping them. If
you're far away and do the
target slash, Link will most
likely do the powerful jump
strike. Slide the stylus around
Link quickly to do a spin
attack. To roll, double tap in
any direction. Don't roll or do
spin attacks too many times, or
Link will become dizzy for a
second or two.

ON-LAND HUD: On the top left of
the screen, you'll see your
health. Just below that, you
will see your current Rupee
count. On the top right, a
button shows your current
equipped weapon, including ammo
for certain items. Press the
Menu button to see a list of
your weapons and bottled
consumables, a save option, the
Collection screen, and the Map.
The Collection screen lets you
see all kinds of stuff as far as
your quest progress is
concerned. Bringing up the map
will let you write clues on it,
just like in Phantom Hourglass.

ON-TRAIN HUD: On the upper left
corner, you'll see a timer (if
applicable). Top right, you will
see your train whistle rope.
Putting the stylus on it and
pulling down will blow it, which
can move any wildlife that may
be on the tracks. Just below
that is the gearbox, which is
basically where you change your
speed. Just tap the handle and
push it on any speed. It can be
either normal speed, fast,
stopped, or reverse. While on
the train, you can tap and drag
the stylus anywhere on the
screen to look around. The Menu
button from when you're on land
is also here. To switch
directions on the track (a bell
will ding and the track will
turn red when you're close to a
fork), a small interface will
appear on the bottom of the
screen with two arrows. Tap the
arrow you want and you'll make
the switch when you arrive at
the fork. Be vigilant on the top
screen, be watchful of other
trains, and don't run into them!

Welcome to the walkthrough for
The Legend of Zelda: Spirit
Tracks! Ready to get on board?
Well, first you have to start up
a file. There's nothing to it,
really. Just pick one of the two
files, type in a name (whatever
you type is what Link will be
called in the game), then
confirm if you are right-handed
or left-handed. After that, pick
your newly-created file, enter
it, and you will have four
choices:

Adventure: Play the main game.
Battle: Play against three other
friends in wireless local
multiplayer. Tag Mode: Trade
items with other friends in
local wireless. Options: Display
and change options, such as
message speed, sound settings,
and hand settings, when desired.

Those should be fairly self-
explanatory. You might've
guessed from the Battle and Tag
Mode descriptions that
multiplayer isn't online in this
game. It's a shame, it was
actually pretty decent in
Phantom Hourglass, and the local
multiplayer here is even better.
Anyway, pick Adventure when
you're ready to start.

The game starts off with telling
of the settlers of New Hyrule,
100 years ago. At that time, an
evil entity simply called the
Demon King inflicted terror upon
the land. The settlers fought
the Demon King alongside the
spirits of the land, shedding
much blood. Eventually the good
side has won, sealing the Demon
King beneath the land with the
use of Spirit Tracks, building
the sacred Tower of Spirits at
the epicenter. Peace has reigned
for many years, but recently,
some of the Tracks have started
to disappear...

Oh hey, it's Niko! So he told
the story just like in Phantom
Hourglass...wait, Niko? Holy
crap dude, you must be insanely
old! Sorry for sleeping over
that... Anyway, eventually your
mentor arrives, named Alfonzo.
He's a big guy...he tells us
that we're gonna meet Princess
Zelda to get our engineer's
certificate. Well that explains
the outfit. Anyway, he's gonna
be expecting us at the train
station, so we'll head over
there.


Aboda Village
----------------
Get used to the controls, then
exit the house. This is Aboda
Village, a quaint little seaside
town with very few people living
around. Follow the path right
and up, and you may get called
over by a girl. Talk to her by
tapping the stylus on her (you
do that to talk to anybody).
She'll then tell you to remove
the rocks in front of her house
and tell you how to do it. Well,
do so, then talk to her again.
She'll give you a Red Rupee for
being so nice. Head up and
you'll see Alfonzo's house with
a bee's hive in a tree nearby.
There's also a guy there. He
tells you how to roll and to
test it out on the tree. Well,
go ahead. Unfortunately the hive
falls down and the bees start
swarming. Enter a house quickly
before they sting you to death.
Exit the house and approach the
train station in the upper
right. That same guy is there.
Talk to him, and as a
consolation for being a jerk, he
gives us a Treasure. Well, real
nice of him. Walk up onto the
station.

Alfonzo brings out the train
you're going to be using. Talk
to him and board the train. He
tells us that we need to get to
the Castle in 300 seconds. Seems
easy enough. Look at the top
screen to see the Rail Map. It's
a fairly straight-forward way,
we're at the bottom and we just
need to head to the upper right
corner. Let's take off! He also
tells you that there are other
trains on the tracks, so don't
hit them. He'll tell you
everything you need to know
about the train, so I don't need
to help you with that. Just
remember to get on your fastest
speed (tap and hold the gearbox
handle in order to move to
different speeds). You'll
eventually get to a fork in the
tracks. He'll tell you how to
switch for you. Also, keep an
eye on the Rail Map on the top
screen. There are other trains
moving about as well. Just
change the tracks in the way you
need to in order to avoid
collisions. Just make your way
to Hyrule Castle Town, and slow
your train speed to a halt when
at the station to stop there.


Castle Town
----------------
Castle Town is a pretty
interesting place. There's lots
of places to check out, but you
can't do much in any of them at
the moment. The shop near the
center holds some interesting
items, including a shield, but
we don't need it right now, plus
we don't have the money. Just
head north up towards the
castle, and you'll meet with the
game's Postman. Instead of like
in Phantom Hourglass, he just
hands you letters so you can
read them yourself. That's a bit
better, so your private life
won't be read out loud. Continue
to the castle. Follow the path
to some guards. Talk to them
until they'll let you in for the
ceremony. Keep going and talk to
the guard. He'll tell you to get
lost, then someone will arrive.
This Chancellor Cole fellow
tells the guard to let you
through, and also leads the way.
Follow him, then watch the scene
as Zelda gives you your
engineer's certificate!

She also hands you a letter in
secret, and tells you to beware
of the Chancellor. Huh. Well,
Cole sends you off and says with
a fanged grin that your train
will become useless soon
anyway...eugh..that guy gives me
the creeps. Anyway, now that you
have your certificate, read the
letter. She wants to meet you in
secret, and gives you a little
piece of map with the letter to
tell you where to go. Tap the
map icon and draw what's on
there onto your map. Now head
down to the first floor, and
take a right. Make sure not to
get spotted by the guard, and
take the nearby staircase up. A
guard will be up here and notice
you, but there's nothing to
worry about, just don't let him
see you cross the thin ledge to
the north. So, cross that, and
enter the door on the other
side.

Once inside, we can make your
way upstairs to the third floor,
where Zelda is. First, navigate
this seemingly empty floor. In
the southwest corner is a
treasure chest. Open it for a
Red Rupee. Now head outside on
this west side to find another
chest! Open it for a piece of
Treasure. Now backtrack and
enter Zelda's room. She's
playing a pan flute and a really
catchy tune, then proceeds to
talk with you. She says that the
tracks that used to be scattered
across the land are vanishing,
and thinks something might've
happened at the Spirit Tower
nearby. She wants to go there to
investigate, but as a Princess,
she's not allowed to leave the
castle. So, she wants to help
you escape. She'll give you a
Recruit Uniform, which helps you
get disguised like the guards to
trick them. Nice, they look just
like the Hero's Clothes. Exit
the room with her.

Now for a little bit of
sneaking. You'll have to
distract the guards so they
don't see Zelda. She'll walk
behind you, but if you need her
to walk by herself, tap the
swirl icon at her feet and trace
a path for her. There's a switch
button to see where Zelda is if
you two get split up, and a Call
button to call her to you. For
now, take her to the outside
here, to the exit to the south
and right. To do this easily,
just walk behind the lower guard
and move Zelda so she's in the
south hall. When the guard
passes to the left, move Zelda
over to the exit and follow her
out.

Now there's even more guards
outside. Thankfully they aren't
moving. Drop down, and get to
the bush. Move Zelda to the
right of the bush, and talk to
the guard on the left side. Stay
there and move Zelda right past
him. Now for the next guard.
Move Zelda to the nearest bush
as possible, and talk to the
guard while on his northwest
side. Move Zelda to the next
bush so she's hiding from that
guard. The next guard doesn't
want to concern himself with
small talk, so we have to get
him to move someplace. He's very
vigilant, so we need to make
some sound so he'll get
distracted. Grab a rock, and
throw it while north of him. He
will come to you, so switch to
Zelda and move her behind the
bush where you are quickly. Now
while that guard is still
distracted, move over to the
guard at the front entrance,
make him look west, and take
Zelda out of the castle grounds.

You'll automatically take Zelda
to the train when you follow her
out. After some talk with
Alfonzo, we'll be back on the
train. This is also automatic,
so don't worry. On the way, the
Spirit Tracks leading to the
tower will vanish. Watch the
scene, the Tower of Spirits has
been blown apart, and its pieces
are floating on top of each
other. Suddenly, the black
clouds above the tower billow,
and a ghost train will appear
from it. Then, Chancellor Cole
will show up and show himself to
be a demon with horns! Wow.
Alfonzo tries to protect the
Princess, but Cole's assistant,
Byrne, takes him out pretty
easily. As Byrne goes to get
Princess Zelda, Link tries to
protect her. Sadly, Link is
tossed away like a ragdoll. Cole
comes up and blasts Zelda with
energy, which separates her
spirit from her body. ...Oh no.
Byrne takes Zelda's body away.

You wake up in a room in Hyrule
Castle with Alfonzo, and an old
man simply called Teacher is
there. Talk to him. Pick the top
option, then the bottom option.
Exit the room, and walk south.
You'll see Zelda's spirit
appear, and float to the next
floor up. Follow her. She'll
float into a room, wondering why
no-one can hear her. Follow her,
open the door, go through, and
head upstairs to her room. After
Link confirms that he can see
her, she apologizes for what
happened, and tells you that she
wants to go back to the Tower of
Spirits. Before we go, she tells
you of the Spirit Flute that she
played before. She'll ask you to
carry it for her, as it may just
help protect her. So now you've
got the Spirit Flute! This
magical instrument can play
songs of mysterious power, but
first we need to learn a song
for it!

Let's exit the Castle. Zelda
mentions that there's a secret
passage to the Spirit Tower from
the Castle, so let's take it.
Head out of her room, open the
door, exit, and go through the
other door. You're at the other
side of the 2nd floor now, so
head downstairs. Talk to the
guard and he'll let you through
after some training. We do need
a sword first before we can
train, so talk to the guard
again and he'll point out where
the guard captain is. Mark that
spot on your map and backtrack
until you're back in the 1st
floor on the other side of the
back room. Head over to the
guard captain's training room.
Talk to him, and after a little
bit, he'll give you the
Recruit's Sword! He'll give you
a __________ ________ little
training now. He teaches you the
targeted attack. | |/ | Just tap
an enemy (guard in this case) to

each guard twice. Next is the

| line that divides the enemy.
Last, the spin attack. Just '\ |

Link. Some pretty easy

back to the back entrance. You
should know the way. Once there,
talk to the guard and he'll let
you through.


Behind the Castle
----------------
There's some Spinuts here
harrassing a guard. Help him out
by defeating them. Talk to him
and he'll tell you to
investigate the wall up ahead.
Head north, climbing the ledges,
and carry a bomb flower to the
walls. Keep trying the walls
until one of them blows up. Head
through.


Tunnel to the Tower
----------------
I'm starting to get Phantom
Hourglass deja-vu here. Head
forward and right, killing the
Keese and Red ChuChus. You'll
see your first locked door, so
time to find a Small Key.
There's a switch here that opens
a door to a chest, but it
doesn't stay down. Move south to
find a block. To push or pull a
block, tap it then choose the
arrow you want. Move that block
onto the switch, then grab the
Small Key inside the chest.
Unlock the door and head
upstairs.

Head up, kill the ChuChus, then
jump right across a series of
small pools. Kill the ChuChus,
open the chest for a Red Rupee
(should have around 100 now),
and use bomb flowers to clear
the obstruction up north. Clear
the Spinuts where the switches
are, and note where they are.
Put dots on the map where they
are if you have to. Now, we have
to hit these in a specific
order. Go back to those small
pools you jumped over, and read
each sign. They'll tell you the
order. Go back to the switches
and hit them in the right order
to open the door. (It is right,
top, bottom, left) Head through.

Kill the Keese and move forward.
You'll hear squeaking, and Zelda
will go to investigate. Then
suddenly, RATS! Oh wow, Zelda's
afraid of mice, how typical.
Kill them, and Zelda will thank
you, saying she never wants to
see them again. Pfft. Keep
moving upstairs again and you
will emerge at the foot of the
Tower of Spirits, floating
precariously piece by piece.
Link and Zelda will enter, and
find a train. It's the Spirit
Train, and the Lokomo Anjean
tells you about it. She watches
over the Tower of Spirits, and
tells Zelda about her family.
She also mentions that Cole is
going to use Zelda's body as a
vessel to resurrect Malladus.
Uh...Zelda? You okay? Hellooo?
OH HOLY HELL, ZELDA! Stop
scaring me! After that...rather
feisty pep talk, Anjean suggests
that Zelda come with you to help
ascend the Tower of Spirits.
She'll reluctantly agree.

Alright, so we're at the base
floor of the Tower of Spirits.
Head north, up the stairs, and
into the spiral staircase. After
Zelda points where we can go,
head up and enter.


Tower of Spirits
----------------
As soon as you enter, walk
forward and a Phantom will
appear, immediately spotting you
and chasing after you. Hurry
back to the exit. The next scene
will be of Link and Zelda
escaping and talking to Anjean.
Anjean assures them that the
Phantoms that guard this tower
are good, but that they might be
possessed by an evil force if
they think you're enemies. She
says that hitting the Phantom in
the back with your sword should
stop it after gathering three
Tears of Light to power up your
sword. So we'll have to go back
and collect them without getting
spotted. Let's go.

Floor 1
-----------
After Zelda reiterates what
Anjean said (c'mon, don't treat
us like we have short term
memory loss!), head up to the
central room with the big door
in front of us. The three Tears
of Light are already here, and
the ones to the west and north
are easy to get. As you approach
one though, you may get stopped
by Anjean speaking to you
through a distance. Didn't
really know you had a cell
phone...anyway, she talks about
those purple spots on the floor,
saying those are safe zones.
They make you invisible to
Phantoms so they can't see you.
Pretty helpful.

After you've collected two Tears
of Light, there's one more left.
To the right where you got the
north Tear, there is a switch.
Hit it and a bridge will extend
to the last Tear temporarily.
There are spikes in the way, so
you'll have to go the long way.
Be careful of the Phantom as you
go around. After collecting the
last Tear, your sword will glow
gold. Now sneak up on the
Phantom here and strike its
back. Watch the scene, and Zelda
will learn that she can possess
Phantoms! Yay! So now whenever
you strike a Phantom's back
after collecting the Tears,
Zelda will possess the Phantom.
Anyway, now that we have a
Phantom for Zelda, you should
know that controlling the
Phantom is the same as when we
snuck Zelda out of the castle.
So...

Since we're at the big door,
press Link up against one side
of the door, then move Phantom
Zelda to the other side of the
door, making sure you get a
crosshairs on the door. You'll
both push the door open,
revealing a staircase to the
next floor. Take it.

Floor 2
-----------
You'll come across some spikes
near where you came up from.
Link obviously can't cross 'em,
but how about Phantom Zelda?
Have her move north past the
spikes and hit the switch on the
other side. This will lower the
spikes so Link can follow. Once
on the right side, go south to
find a door and two switches.
Have Link stand on one, then
Phantom Zelda on the other to
open the door. These are pretty
simple puzzles so far.

Be careful when passing this
southern passage. There are Rats
here, and Zelda is still afraid
of Rats even when in that
hulking suit of armor. So kill
any Rats that may try to annoy
you and push/pull the nearby
block in front of the rat hole
so no more Rats will come. Have
Zelda cross the spikes and she
will notice that there's another
Phantom on this side. It's just
standing in place, looking
around, so it'll be easy to
distract it. First, have Zelda
hit the switch behind it, then
have her talk to the Phantom on
either the left or right side,
and have Link sneak behind and
up to the staircase. Call Zelda
so you can ascend to the next
floor.

Floor 3
-----------
That's it for this runthrough of
the tower. Zelda will escape the
Phantom's body, killing it in
the process. Link's sword will
also run out of the Tear's
power. No worries, what we're
looking for is right here. Walk
up to the altar to pick up the
Forest rail map! Now the Spirit
Tracks are coming back! Yay! A
blue light will appear. Step
into it to be warped back to
Anjean. Talk to her to start a
scene. Anjean will tell you to
go to the first temple that's
nearest here, and that is in the
Forest Realm, where we were this
whole time. She says that a
fellow Lokomo is stationed
(pardon the pun) south of the
temple in the Forest Sanctuary,
and points it out on your Rail
Map. She then also gives us the
sacred Spirit Train to help us
on our journey. Nice,
considering we lost our original
train...
----------------

So now that we restored part of
the Spirit Tracks and have
ourselves a shiny new train with
an awesome-sounding whistle,
let's head over to the Forest
Sanctuary. Before that though,
we need to head to Whittleton
Village, which is the stop
between here and Aboda
Village...so make a trail to
that place. Along the way
though, you'll have to deal with
some Snurgles and Moinks. Not
much of a problem, just use your
whistle on both.


Whittleton
----------------
This is a nice little area for
carpenters. Anyway, now that
we're here, if you have 80
Rupees or more, enter the shop
just left of the station and
purchase the Shield. It'll be
helpful. We need to talk to the
chief of this village, and he's
living in the biggest house to
the north. So enter it, and talk
to him. He will mention that if
you're going to the Forest
Sanctuary to find Gage, you'll
need to first traverse the Lost
Woods west of this village, and
he says to ask the locals about
the Lost Woods for some tips.
Well, talk to them. After
gathering enough info, you'll
learn that the branches of the
trees point the way you're
supposed to go, but the fourth
tree always lies. Nice to
know...

Anyway, we could explore
Whittleton further north, but we
can't do much even if we did, so
head back to the train station
and take off. Trace a path to
the Forest Sanctuary, where that
lone track in the middle of the
forest ends. Once you enter the
Lost Woods, remember the advice
given! Just so that the trees
don't throw you off, you're
looking for the naked brown
trees (ones with no leaves) with
a huge branch. If the branch
points right, you go right. Go
left if it points left. The
train goes faster each time you
get the path right, so prepare
to have good reflexes at the
final (fourth) tree, since it
always lies, you'll have to take
the path it's not pointing
towards.


Forest Sanctuary
----------------
We're here at Gage's home.
However, we must go through a
couple of trials before we can
reach him. Head up north, kill
the Spinuts and the Crow, and
climb up on the right side. Head
south to find bomb flowers. Now
we can do two things with these.
First, take one, then head up
near the top left of this area
to find some blocks at the top
of a ramp. Blow them up with the
bomb flower to open a bit of a
shortcut up there. Now head
back, pick up a bomb flower, and
cross the bridge. See the
switch? Well, place the bomb
beside the switch, then run to
get another bomb flower. Rush
back and the switch that
activated should create a bridge
temporarily. Run across that and
use the bomb flower to blow up
the blocks to the left, allowing
the way further into the
Sanctuary to open.

Move left and you'll find a
stone that looks like a space
shuttle with a hole in the
middle. Check it and you'll hear
it makes noise along with
colored bubbles of light
emitting from it. Bring out your
Spirit Flute. Now, to use this
Flute, you have to have the
stylus held onto the Flute so
you can switch which pipe you
want to blow out of. As a help,
there's a line on the center of
the top screen to tell you where
you need to line up the pipe. To
blow, just blow at the DS. The
microphone will pick up the
noise and play it. Notice how
each pipe is colored
differently? Also, notice the
color of the light bubbles from
the sound stone? Play the color
of the corresponding pipes in
order, which is light blue and
red. Play these and you will
have learned the Song of
Awakening! This song can be used
to awaken sleeping statues, as
the statue says that emerges
from the sound stone.
   _ _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  
  /
O/  SONG OF AWAKENING LEARNED
  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  
This is just practice to prepare
for what's coming up. Move ahead
to find a circle of statue
heads. Draw a line in the
direction each of them are
facing, then read the sign in
the middle. It says, "Connect
the two stone statues that face
each other." Well, that should
be simple. Just in case you
don't want to waste time, you
connect the lower rightmost
statue to the uppermost left
statue. Head through the door
that opens to arrive at Gage's
domain. Talk to him and he will
say that the way to the Forest
Temple will be opened if you
play the Spirit Flute with him
and his instrument. Now, these
Lokomo duets seem to be a
problem area with a lot of
players. There's just a few
things to know:

- Only play your notes when the 
 but I have to say it.)
- Don't blow too hard or too sof
- Keep the rhythm as close to th
- The game doesn't register a no
 so if you have to skip over a p
 the note.

You likely won't need these tips
right now, but when the duets
become harder, keep them in
mind. That said, the notes you
need to play are Red, Yellow,
and Purple. You need to play
your notes after Gage does his
number and switches to you.
Don't let his number confuse
you, just stay with the notes on
the top screen. After you have
completed the duet, your Forest
rail map will start glowing,
showing some new Spirit Tracks!
Now you can enter the Forest
Temple! Exit the room and return
to the train station so you can
take off.

Just draw a path to the giant
tree icon to the north, towards
the Forest Temple. Along the way
you may come across Skulltulas
hanging down from trees. Just
sound your whistle to scare them
away. Once at the temple's
station, head north and you'll
find another sound stone. Check
it and it will play a green
note, a white note, then a green
note. Play those pipes on your
Spirit Flute to learn the Song
of Healing! No, it's not the
same song from Majora's Mask,
sadly. This one lets you use a
fairy when played, which
restores your health. However,
it can only be used in temples,
and it can only be used once in
a given temple at that. Think of
it as using your last bottled
fairy when in a temple, and you
can't get another fairy until
the next temple. Anyway, enter
the Forest Temple now.

Forest Temple
----------------

Floor 1
-----------
Once you walk north you'll spot
a locked door. Time for a small
key already. Follow the path
around it to find some nuts
growing. Hitting them gives you
some pickups, but there's
another purpose for them. See
the pit on the right? There's a
switch on the other side. Pick
up one of those nuts and throw
it at the switch to extend a
bridge across the pit. Cross it
then head south to get locked in
a room with yellow and green
Spinuts. No problem. After
they're killed, a chest will
appear, and the doors will open
back up. Open the chest for a
Big Green Rupee, worth 100
Rupees! Wow. Head upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
There's a lot of poison mist
down here, and if you touch it
you take damage. Just head
north, walking around the poison
mist, until you get locked into
a room with four Vengas. A
Vengas is a spider-ish enemy
that is filled with poison. Kill
them, and they explode in a
small cloud of poison mist. Kill
them all, and a chest will
appear. Open it to get the
Whirlwind item! Now you can blow
gusts of wind with this bad boy!

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This item uses the DS's
microphone like the Spirit Flute
does, along with the stylus to
aim. Just aim yourself, and blow
a small gust to create a
whirlwind that moves forward
rapidly. It can blow away mist,
stun enemies, and solve puzzles,
of course. Use your new item and
blow a whirlwind at the wind
catcher at the top of this room
to open a door to the left.
Don't head that way yet though.
Instead, head back south and
blow away all the poison mist to
reveal a chest in the corner.
Open it for a piece of Treasure!
Now head back and continue west.
Ignore the Gossip Stone (we got
all the treasure chests on this
floor, and that's all it does is
tell you where you can find
them) blow away the poison mist
blocking the staircase, and go
back down to Floor 1.

Floor 1
-----------
We're now on the northern part
of this floor. There's a giant
abyss in the center here, and in
the middle of the abyss is the
small key we need. Use the
Whirlwind to blow it off its
pedestal and to a place where we
can reach it. Go and grab it,
then head east and step on the
ground switch to open the door
back to where we were at the
beginning. Now this place is
filled with Vengas! Dispose of
them properly, then head to the
mist-filled northeast corner of
this floor. Blow them away and
you'll find a structure called a
stamp station. We can't do
anything with it, but mark it on
your map for later. There's also
a ground switch here. Step on it
to make a chest appear to the
south, but you'll have to go
around to get it. Open it for
another Big Green Rupee!

Now use your small key to open
that locked door, and follow the
hall to get locked into battle
with some Poison Bubbles! These
floating skulls are invulnerable
while poison mist is surrounding
them, so target them with the
Whirlwind and blow them away.
Now strike them with the sword
to end them. Head upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Head right while killing Vengas
to find another locked door.
Head back then north to go
upstairs once more.

Floor 3
-----------
You'll notice immediately a nut
in front of a large pit, and a
switch on the other side of the
pit. Stand behind the nut and
blow a whirlwind straight to the
switch. A chest will appear.
Open it for that small key we
need! Head back downstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Return to the locked door, open
it, then enter the room to fight
a Mothula enemy! This thing
disappears when you get near it,
and it uses its wings to blow
away any whirlwinds you blow at
it. Don't get caught in the
reflected whirlwind, because if
you do, Link will get dizzy and
the Mothula will take the
opportunity to ram into you. So
what to do? Well, it also spits
out Poison Bubbles. Keep your
Whirlwind aimed at it, and when
it spits out a Poison Bubble,
blow it right back at the
Mothula to stun it. Head over to
it and slash it a few times.
Repeat once more to kill it. The
doors will open now, so head
upstairs.

Floor 3
-----------
You'll emerge in a large room
with some weird-looking tiles
strewn about. Head south to
another room where you'll see a
blue worm. This Blastworm curls
into a spiky ball when hit, and
blows up when hit again. You can
use this to your advantage. Hit
a Blastworm, then blow it
towards the blocks to the right
to blast them away. Blow away
all the poison mist here and
cross the pit. Step on the
ground switch along the way to
make a chest appear on the other
side. Open that for a piece of
treasure. Hit the switch to make
a door open down on the
southwest side. Head over there.

There's some blastable blocks on
the other side of the pit to the
north here. Thankfully there's
also a couple of Blastworms.
Make sure to hit them first
before blowing them. ...That's
your own dirty mind, stop that.
Anyway, once the blocks are
clear, hit the switch with
another curled-up Blastworm.
This will open the door to the
Boss Key in the northeast
corner. Head all the way over
there, and before picking it up,
read the sign behind it. It's a
little map to show you a path
you must take. Trace that path
onto your own map on this floor,
as it's the path you must take
so that no enemies named Key
Masters will take the Boss Key.

After having taken the path,
open the gate by throwing the
Boss Key onto it. Head upstairs.
Break open the pots if you need
health, head up to the stone
tablet and read it to make a
blue portal appear that will
return you to the temple
entrance if you wish to. When
you're ready, head upstairs
again into the boss chamber.

-----------
BOSS: Stagnox, Armored Colossus
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This ugly-looking, giant stag
beetle has its abdomen as its
weakness. It covers it with
poison mist, so it won't be that
easy to reach it. It starts off
the battle by constantly facing
you no matter where you move.
Just keep still until you see it
move forward, as it will attempt
to knock you around with its
horns. Move away and quickly get
behind it. Blow away the mist
with the Whirlwind, then strike
its abdomen until it turns
around. Repeat the process, and
Stagnox will change its
strategy.

It will start flying around the
room now, and will eventually
stop in front of you on the top
screen. After a while, it will
spawn three Blastworms and throw
them down towards you. Kill them
all except for one, and make
sure it's curled up. Keep the
Whirlwind aimed at that
Blastworm, and wait for Stagnox
to come flying down towards you.
Blow a whirlwind towards the
Blastworm while aiming at
Stagnox and it will blow up in
its face, making it fall on its
back. Slash the abdomen until it
gets up and flies away. Repeat
until it's finally dead.
-----------

For defeating it, a giant green
Force Gem appears in its wake!
Watch the scene as a structure
appears from the ground, and the
giant Force Gem rests on the
structure. The new power from
the forest will rush to the
Tower of Spirits, restoring a
section of the tower! Looks like
we can explore the Tower
further...open the chest that
appears for a brand new Heart
Container (four hearts of health
now, yeah!), and enter the blue
light to teleport back to this
temple's train station.

Take the train out. We're
heading straight back to the
Tower of Spirits. Along the way
though, stop at the Forest
Sanctuary. Remember that high
ledge with the Cucco? Well, kill
the Spinuts first, then got on
the ledge to the left. Use the
Whirlwind to blow the Cucco off
its ledge. Grab it, climb back
up, and jump off towards that
treasure chest the Cucco was
with before. Open it for a Big
Red Rupee, which is worth a
super nice 200 Rupees! Get back
on the train and head to the
Tower of Spirits. Thankfully we
don't have to traverse the Lost
Woods again.

Along the way though, you know
those trains at the beginning of
the game? Well, they get
possessed by evil magic and turn
into Dark Trains. These train
enemies move just slightly
faster than you can and chase
after you when they spot you.
You have a right to fear these,
as they can kill you in one hit!
Ouch! The map is extremely
helpful against these invincible
Dark Trains, as it shows where
they are and which way they'll
turn at forks in the Tracks. For
the most part, they always stay
in one area, so if you go out of
their little patrol area,
(which, here, is the top right
and center tracks) they'll leave
you alone. I wish you luck on
your journey to the Tower of
Spirits.


Tower of Spirits
----------------
Talk to Anjean and she will tell
you that the next Temple awaits
in the Snow Realm, but we must
first find the Snow rail map
within the tower. Alright. Head
up the stairs and enter the
spiral staircase. Now, you know
what's cool? We can actually
head up this staircase, past the
previous entrance, into a new
one. This way, we don't have to
go through the floors we just
cleared. Neat.

Floor 4
-----------
A couple of Phantoms will appear
on this floor. The three Tears
of Light we need to collect are
also on this floor. Head right,
being careful of the flame-
thrower, and enter the safe
zone. Wait until the Phantom
passes by and is out of your
way, and go to the south of the
lava pit where the Tear of Light
is. Blow it out of the lava pit
with the Whirlwind, then go
around cautiously and pick it
up. Now simply pick up the other
two which are in the other two
safe zones. (The one on the left
is blocked by a constant stream
of flame. To get past, stay on
the bottom path, and wait until
the Phantom starts moving right.
Its body will block the flame,
allowing you to pass briefly.)
Once your sword is powered up,
strike a Phantom in the back,
then tap it to have Zelda
possess it.

A new thing we can learn on this
visit to the Tower is that
Phantoms are immune to lava, so
Zelda can walk in lava without
getting hurt! Not only that, but
if Phantom Zelda is below Link,
you can have Link ride on top of
Zelda with her shield, to
transport Link around and over
lava pits. She can also block
streams of fire. Move yourselves
out of this area, and open the
chest by the small lava pit for
a piece of treasure, then head
to the large lava pit on the
south. Trace a path for Zelda so
that you can hop onto her and
cross the lava pit. Get off by
double tapping anywhere and
follow the path upstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
Follow the hall to an even
larger lava pit. Get Zelda into
the lava and have Link hop on.
Move to the northern side and
use the Whirlwind on the wind
catcher there. Move to the
western side now and use the
Whirlwind on that wind catcher,
being careful of the Keese there
as well. This will open the door
just to the north. Get off Zelda
and open the chest nearby first
for a Big Green Rupee before
moving to that door. Follow the
hall, ignore the turn to the
north, and you'll see a locked
door. Head south into a room
with a single Spinut.

This Spinut's a coward, but for
good reason. It has the small
key we're looking for. It runs
fast, so we need to corner it.
Chase it into a corner and
quickly have Zelda at one end
while you head to the other
side. The Spinut will have
nowhere to run, so you can kill
it for the key. Use that to open
the locked door. Have Zelda
carry you across the lava pit,
then head upstairs.

Floor 6
-----------
Right as you enter, you'll be
locked in with a Geozard, which
looks like the Zora Warrior from
Phantom Hourglass. With Phantom
Zelda though, this Geozard is
easier to deal with. Have Zelda
distract the Geozard (since it
mainly goes after you) by
attacking it (trace a path into
the enemy so there's a
crosshairs). Once Zelda attacks
it, both she and the enemy will
go into a little sword fight.
While the Geozard is distracted,
get behind it and slash its
back. Repeat until it's dead.
Zelda and Link make great
teamwork, don't they?

Follow the hall past the now-
opened door into a room with a
Mounted Miniblin. Those annoying
things got even more annoying.
Best part? Can't deal with them
unless you're riding Zelda.
Seriously. Thankfully, there's a
high ledge to the right here
that you can use. It's blocked
by a constant flamethrower
stream though. Just trace a path
for Zelda across the flames and
use her as a shield and walk
with her so you don't get
flamed. Now get on Zelda and
kill the Mounted Miniblin with a
slash. Head east, being careful
of the flamethrower on your
level. If you need to stop Zelda
in the middle of her path, just
tap the icon at her feet. While
still on Zelda, use the
Whirlwind to knock the small key
off its perch. Walk Zelda to it
and you'll somehow pick it up.
Head back west and then north
into the center room. Kill the
Mounted Miniblins, then hop off
Zelda. Unlock the door, then go
upstairs.

Floor 7
-----------
We've reached the end! The Snow
rail map is here. Go grab it,
then take the blue light back to
Anjean. Talk to her and after
some speech, you'll take the
train back to the Forest Realm.
----------------

Before heading on to the Snow
Realm, let's take care of some
things first. Stop at Castle
Town from here. You'll encounter
new enemies called Bullbos along
the way, but these ones are not
scared of your whistle, and will
ram you a few times. Zelda will
chime in and say that if we keep
getting hit, the train's going
to explode, and suggests to go
see Alfonzo for something to
defend our train with. Alfonzo
was resting at Hyrule Castle the
last time we left him, so good
thing we're heading there. Stop
at Castle Town.


Castle Town
----------------
Before heading up to Hyrule
Castle, enter the building in
the lower right corner. This is
the Take 'Em All On challenge,
where you go through floors
fighting all kinds of enemies,
eventually reaching a boss at
the end. There's no hearts to
heal with and you can't use
potions. Now that you finished
the Forest Temple, Level 1 is
unlocked here. You can play for
50 Rupees. Sounds reasonable, so
head on in. Don't worry about
Level 1. It's really easy. The
boss you fight at the end is
Stagnox again. For clearing
this, you get yourself a Heart
Container for your efforts!
Awesome.

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now that you have some money, we
can indulge for a little bit at
the shop. Buy yourself a potion,
as you're gonna need one for the
Snow Temple's boss. Also get
yourself some Prize Postcards.
These things, once sent in using
a mailbox, can help you win
prizes, usually just treasure.
What kind of treasure that is
given away is shown on the
bulletin board of any town,
including this one. The more
Prize Postcards sent in, the
higher your chances of winning!
Twenty is all you can send in
one real time day. You'll find
out if you won by turning the
game on the next day, so buy at
least 10 and put them in the
mailbox. Speaking of which,
there's a letter for you. It's
from Alfonzo, and he's ready for
you to pick him up and transport
him back to Aboda. Convenient,
we were just heading over to him
anyway.

Enter Hyrule Castle, first
floor, and enter the room to the
left, where the rest room is.
Alfonzo is there, so talk to him
and he will go to the train
station. Head back, and talk to
Alfonzo to get on with him.
Simply trace a path to Aboda
Village, but just beware of the
Dark Trains!


Aboda Village
----------------
Once you dock, Alfonzo will tell
you that he's gonna outfit your
train with something neat
that'll help you defend your
train much better...but it'll
take a while. He suggests
stopping by Niko's, so let's do
that. Talk to him and he will
say that you in that soldier's
garb reminds him of a friend of
his way back when...I bet I know
who's he's talking about.
Anyway, he asks a favor of you,
to document your travels by
finding stamp stations and
stamping them onto a Stamp Book
that he's giving to you. There
are about 20 stamp stations in
the game, and if you have enough
stamps, he might give you
something awesome...can't wait,
actually!

Since we're here, there's
actually a stamp station right
here in Aboda Village! It's
right beside Alfonzo's house
near the pen, so check it so you
can stamp it __________ ________
on any page. Yay! You can talk
to the locals if you want | |/ |
to, but they don't really have
anything interesting to | ABODA

the train station and Alfonzo
will | PRINTED | have your
cannon ready! Yep, you can now
attack enemies '\ | while on the
train. To use it, just tap
anywhere on the
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  screen. Aw
hit them with the cannon enough
times, but they still can't be
destroyed. Anyway, it's time to
go back to some areas we've been
to and start filling our stamp
book. Stop at Whittleton.


Whittleton
----------------
All around Whittleton, you may
have noticed leaves scattered
all around the village. Well,
you can blow these away with the
Whirlwind item. Sometimes you
can find Treasure underneath
them, so it's good to try it.
The main reason we are here,
though, is to find the stamp
station. Just head north using
the wooded path east of the
village itself. You'll arrive in
a new area behind Whittleton.
You can't explore much here
until we have ourselves the
right item, but the stamp
station is reachable just up
ahead. Get your stamp (remember,
you only need to stamp the book
once for each station) and head
out. Next stop, the Forest
Sanctuary!

Trace a path for your train up
the northwestern tracks leading
up to the Snow Realm. You'll
encounter a large boulder on the
tracks. Use the emergency brakes
(just go reverse until you stop,
then put the speed marker on
stop) and hit it with the cannon
until it's gone. Keep going,
you'll come to a station. Stop
here.


Rabbitland Rescue
----------------
This area is a haven for rabbits
to stay and enjoy life without
the harm from other wildlife out
there. This rabbit enthusiast
wants you to find rabbits, catch
them, and bring them here. There
are 50 rabbits in all, and if
you get them all, you'll be
rewarded. He gives you a Rabbit
Net for use! They're found all
over the overworld while you're
riding your train, and are
usually hiding behind things
like rocks. You can spot them
more easily by sounding your
whistle: they jump pretty high
in the air. Destroy the rock or
object the rabbit is hiding
behind, and you will go into a
little catching minigame. You
have 10 seconds to catch the
rabbit before it hops away. Just
tap the screen to swing the net
down. We're gonna find the
rabbits that are available in
the Forest Realm before finally
heading off to the Snow Realm,
so I'll give you a map. It's
better than trying to tell you
through text.

Once you arrive at the Snow
Realm, take a right in the first
fork. You'll spot a strange
stone arch with a green triangle
above it. This is actually a
warpgate. You first activate it
by hitting the triangle with
your cannon. Next, when you
approach the gate, blow your
whistle and a portal will appear
on the tracks. As long as the
whistle blows, the portal will
stay open. Drive through it and
you will appear at another spot.
This warpgate takes us back to
the Forest Realm, but we don't
need to go back there. Just hit
the triangle to activate it, and
make your stop over at Anouki
Village, the only stop you see
on the map right now.


Anouki Village
----------------
So the Anoukis from Phantom
Hourglass return in this game!
We have to do a little bit of
stuff here before we can make
our way to the Snow Sanctuary,
so __________ ________ let's get
started. First off, there's a
stamp station | |/ | here. Walk
over to the northeast corner of
this village, | ANOUKI STAMP |
outside the village boundries,
behind some trees, guarded |
PRINTED | by White Wolfos. Now
that you have that, we can also
'\ | learn a new Flute song, as
there's a sound stone here
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  too! It's 
house. The bubbles that come
from it are Red, Yellow, Red,
Light Blue. Play them to learn
the Song of Discovery! This is
basically the Shovel from
Phantom Hourglass. Play it and a
treasure box may rise from the
ground!
   _ _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  
  /
O/  SONG OF DISCOVERY LEARNED
  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  
In this case, one does show up.
Open it for a Red Potion! Nice.
We have two of those now, unless
you didn't buy the first one at
a shop or used it already.
Anyway, let's talk to the Honcho
of the village, which is the
northernmost house here, if you
couldn't tell. Talk to him, and
whatever you pick as a response,
you'll ask him how to reach the
Snow Sanctuary, but he'll say
the road is blocked because a
ginormous monster is in the
caves. Explains that lock on the
tracks as we were getting to
this village...oh, he's asking
us a favor. He's forming a
"neighborhood watch" group so
they can stand up against any
monsters, and wants you to help
pair up each Anouki. However,
they're pretty picky, so we'll
have to talk to each of them.

If you've talked to them, the
information written down should
lead to these results (listing
Anoukis by number, left to
right, top ones first; 1 is top
left, 6 is bottom right):

- 1 should pair up with 6
- 2 should pair up with 4
- 3 should pair up with 5

Go back to Honcho and connect
each Anouki to form 3 groups of
two. He gives us a Red Rupee for
helpin' out! He also opens up
the way to the Snow Sanctuary,
once you remind him, of course.
That's about all we can do in
the village right now, so get
back on the train. Once back out
on the tracks, start heading
west from the village. You'll
spot another Rabbit! Catch it,
and that'll make it your fifth
one! Before headng to the Snow
Sanctuary, stop off at
Rabbitland Rescue back in the
Forest Realm. Talk to the guy
there and as a reward for
rescuing 5 Rabbits, he gets you
a Heart Container! Awesome! Head
back to the Snow Realm and take
the path to the Snow Sanctuary.

Once you enter the cave, prepare
for...

-----------
BOSS: Rocktite ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This scary enemy constantly
chases after you. The cave never
seems to end unless the monster
is defeated as well. Its
weakpoint is the eye in the
center, and it's best to fire at
it whenever you see the eye.
Even if you don't see its body,
just aim at its eye whenever you
see it. It takes multiple hits
to stun him so you can gain some
leeway. The thing gets faster
every time it's stunned, and it
seems like it takes forever to
kill it. Eventually, it does
die.
-----------

Snow Sanctuary
----------------
After that harrowing experience,
you'll arrive here. There's an
Anouki shop right nearby in case
you need to stock up on some
things. A Heart Container is
also sold here, but it's priced
at a hefty 2,000 Rupees. We'll
have to come back later...exit
the shop and follow the path
northward while avoiding/killing
any White Wolfos in your way.
Once you get on a higher ledge,
look for a small __________
________ staircase leading up to
a stamp station. Get the stamp |

moving onward, east this time. |
SNOW SANC. STAMP | Keep
following the path to the

ChuChus. Enter the cave at '\ |
the end. Yep, there's one more
puzzle here. See all the
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  statues? G
facing. Once that's done, read
the stone tablet next to the
ground switch on the south. It
says, "When the door opens, head
to the far room without being
seen... And do it before the
time runs out..." So, look at
what you drew and you can
decipher a path to take! Hit the
ground switch, take that path,
and finally enter Steem's
domain. Here's a little map of
this puzzle just in case.

Agree to do the duet with Steem.
As you may expect, this one's a
little harder. Keep in mind the
tips I explained back with
Gage's duet, and your notes are:
Light Blue, White, Light Blue,
Red. After the chilling duet is
played, your Snow rail map will
start glowing, showing lots of
Spirit Tracks appearing in the
Snow Realm! Now we can head to
the Snow Temple! Oh...wait,
Steem says that blizzards have
been surrounding the temple, so
it's easy to get lost. Alright,
guess we have to find someone to
give us the right path. Get back
on your train and set off
towards the east area. Along the
way, be careful of some new
enemies, like Sir Frosty. Along
the way, after shortly passing
through some trees, you'll see a
station. Stop there.


Wellspring Station
----------------
There's an icy spring here, a
few platforms, and a house.
Enter the house, it's the only
interesting thing as of now.
Walk around inside and Zelda
will notice a note on the desk.
"Need to get good shots of these
hot new trains. I'll try these
spots today." The drawing on
there is similar to the tracks
just east of this quaint little
area, and three spots are
circled red. Mark down those
spots on your Rail Map, and go
back to your train. Head out and
inspect those spots, being ever
careful of the Dark Train
roaming around. If you find a
guy on the side of the rails
snapping pictures, stop in front
of him. This guy is named
Ferrus. Tell him you're headed
to the Temple here, and he says
that the Spirit Tracks that
connect from the Tower of
Spirits to the Temple are safe
from the blizzard, so we'll take
that path. He gives us a really
dusty map. Just blow off the
dust, and your rail map will
come up right as Ferrus's map is
cleared off. Trace the correct
path needed, and there you go!
We'll take that path. After
talking to him, we get right
back on our train. Follow the
path you drew and we're
practically there at the Snow
Temple!


Snow Temple
----------------
Phew, that was harrowing. How
can Link bear that frigid
blizzard? Ah well, we're here
anyway, so head north, prepare
your stuff, and head inside.

Floor 1
-----------
This place looks cold too...even
the shrubbery is frozen solid...
Kill the Keese and move
northward into a room after
breaking the frozen grass. Zelda
will notice a block with a bell
on it. There are also three
tiles with bell symbols on them.
Not only THAT, there are also
Ice ChuChus. Get rid of the
ChuChus first, then push this
block north into a bell tile.
The sign just north of it shows
two bells on a musical staff.
This is a clue. Just hit the
bell twice with your sword and a
door will open to the east. Take
that passage.

We need to get across here, but
the ledges are too far apart.
That block seems like it might
help us. Since blocks slide
along ice, push this block
south, west, north, east, then
north. Now use it to hop across.
Follow the passage outside to
some new enemies named Octives.
These enemies reside in icy
water and spit out spiky rocks.
Kinda like Octoroks in the
3D-style games. There's a switch
across the water too. Use the
Whirlwind to blow one of those
Octive's rocks right at the
switch, creating a bridge across
this whole room. Cross it, being
careful of the second Octive,
and head downstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
There's a block here. Push it
onto the water, then hop on the
block. To move around while on
this block, take out the
Whirlwind, face the opposite
direction you want to go to, and
blow. There's a wind catcher to
the right. Make it move with the
Whirlwind, then head north onto
some land...where a Freezard is.
These things ricochet across the
room at high speeds when hit, so
hit it in a way so that it flies
right into the water. Move north
to another block. Push it onto
the water, and move left,
hugging the south wall, until
you see a turn. Go south down
that to find a chest containing
a Red Rupee.

Get back on the block and move
back to the main watery area.
There's lots of Octives here.
Kill them all by blowing their
rocks back at them and a chest
will appear at the north end.
Head over there and open it for
a piece of Treasure. Head north,
then west to get locked into a
room of three Ice Keese! These
cold bats freeze you on contact,
so use the Whirlwind to stun
them first before killing them.
For defeating them, a chest will
appear. Open it to get the
Boomerang! Ah, it feels good to
have this item. Now you can
switch between items using the
Menu button on the screen. Head
back east to where the pit is
and you'll see two switches. Hit
them with one throw of the
Boomerang by tracing the
Boomerang's path over the
switches, and a bridge will
extend. Cross it, then head
upstairs.

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Floor 1
-----------
Head west to find a block with a
bell on it, and a sign behind
it. Read the sign to see four
bells: two on the bottom, two on
the top. The top ones are
between the bottom ones. Seems
like a series of bells you have
to hit. The lower the bell, the
deeper the bell's noise is.
Alright. Head south and around
to see a pit, two Ice Keese, and
a switch around the corner. Use
the Boomerang to hit the switch,
opening a door to the left. Kill
the two Ice Keese with the
Boomerang and a chest will
appear back where you came up
here. Go open it for a piece of
Treasure. Now, push the bell
south, then west to get it into
the central room with the other
bell.

Push the bell north, west,
south, east, south, west, south
to get it into the bell tile.
Now, remember the bells on that
sign back there? Medium, high,
high, medium? Well, trace a path
for the Boomerang in such a way
that it hits the big bell, then
the small bell twice, then the
big bell again. A hint that the
Boomy is gonna hit the bell is
when you see a yellow "impact"
icon over the bell. This will
open a door to the west. Take
it, follow it outside.

There's five torches here, the
middle one is lit. Obviously,
they need to all be lit to
unlock the way, but they have to
be lit in a certain order. How
to figure that out? Trace a
Boomerang path into the lit
torch, then all around the snow.
The Boomerang will catch on fire
and melt the snow that it hovers
over. Melt enough snow, and
you'll see tiles next to each of
the four unlit torches. The dots
in the tiles tell you which
torch should be lit first, then
second, then third, then finally
fourth. Have the Boomerang light
them in that order with one
throw, and a door will open.
Head downstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
You'll immediately see a locked
door. Head east from it to find
some water and an icy torch.
Now, this is a really cool
feature, pun intended. Have the
Boomerang become icy by
targeting the torch, and have it
hover over the water. It creates
a temporary sheet of ice! Nice!
Make an ice bridge to the ledge
on the right and open up the
chest for a small key. Run back
across, unlock the door, and
head inside to get locked in an
icy room with four Freezards.
Instead of attacking them with
your sword, melt them by
lighting up your Boomerang with
the fiery torch. They melt into
simple Octoroks, so kill them.

The doors will open, including
the east one. Head over to the
east door but don't fall into
the water. There's a frozen wind
catcher to the north. Unfreeze
it using the fiery torch you
used before, with the Boomerang.
Now use the Boomerang on the icy
torch to the south, create a
sheet of ice, stand on it, and
use the Whirlwind on the wind
catcher to open the door to the
north. Head over there to arrive
in a LARGE room filled with
water. There's also some unlit
torches and Octives that need to
be defeated. They can be stunned
with the Boomerang before you
can walk over and kill them, but
it's just as easy to use the
Whirlwind to blow back their
rocks. Create a sheet of ice so
you reach the northeast corner
of this room, where a stamp
station awaits. Get stamped!

      |     PRINTED      |

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now proceed by lighting all the
torches here with ice using the
Boomerang, and kill all the
Octives. Once every Octive is
killed, a chest will appear on
the northwest corner, near the
staircase we need to go up. Head
there, open the chest for a Big
Green Rupee, then head upstairs.

Floor 1
-----------
There's a block here with a
rather large bell. Ignore it for
now and head out south to a room
filled with Fire Keese. You'll
have to kill these things with
the Boomerang, or deal with them
the same way you did the Ice
Keese: Whirlwind, then strike.
Melt all the snow on the floor
in this room with a lit
Boomerang to find a mural of a
musical staff with some bells on
it. Low, medium, medium, high,
medium. Either remember this
pattern or write it down on your
map with "L", "M", and "H" to
represent the bells. Exit this
room.

Use the icy torches and your
Boomerang here to create an ice
sheet so you can step on the
ground switch in the alcove to
your right. This opens up the
door. Create an ice sheet so you
can go around, and open the
chest for a Red Rupee. Now,
let's get this bad bell where it
belongs. Push it north, east,
south, west, then north. Before
pushing it east, create an ice
sheet to bridge the gap for the
bell, then push it.

Now, before pushing the bell
anymore, use the icy torches
here, and use them to "light"
the two torches in the north of
the central room. This makes a
chest appear in the next room to
the north, we'll get that soon.
Back to the bell. There's a pool
of water that it needs to cross.
Make an icy sheet on that water
with the Boomerang and quickly
push the bell south, west, then
south. Now that it's safe, push
the bell west, north, then east
onto the bell tile. Now, we need
to hit the bells in the correct
order like we learned in that
Fire Keese room. Trace a
Boomerang path to hit the large
bell, the medium bell twice, the
small bell once, and the medium
bell once again. If you don't
optimize the Boomerang's path,
the path may stop before you can
finish it, so you'll have to be
careful here. Once done
correctly, the door to the north
will open. Head through, open
the chest for a Red Rupee, then
head upstairs, ignoring the
Freezard.

Floor 2
-----------
Almost done with this temple! To
the left raised room is a bunch
of torches on a purple carpet.
Ignore them and head south,
killing the Ice ChuChus, passing
the boss door, and north to a
sign. It shows three ice symbols
and three fire symbols, in a
circle much like those torches
were. Mark three of the torches
on your map so you'll know which
ones to light for a certain
type, then head over to that
torch room. Light the torches in
the proper way, (you can have
the Boomerang change from on
fire to icy in a whim while it's
still flying, remember) and a
door will open to the east. Head
over there.

Oh no, you're locked into a room
with some White Wolfos!
Remember, to defeat them easily,
corner them. After they're gone,
head east and south down a hall.
Step on the ground switch to
create a bridge, then use the
Whirlwind to blow the Boss Key
onto the bridge. Pick it up,
then use it to unlock the boss
door up ahead. Head upstairs,
fill up with the pots, read the
stone tablet for a blue light
portal if you need it, and head
up to the boss room when you're
ready.

-----------
BOSS: Fraaz, Master of Icy Fire
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is practically the same
character as Blaaz from Phantom
Hourglass. However, the way to
defeat this boss works
differently, and he's also
surprisingly hard...at least for
the time you face him. Right
now, Fraaz uses two forms of
power: ice and fire. He'll bloat
up and charge up either power,
and you can tell which power
depending on the color. (Blue or
Red) Whichever color he is,
light up your Boomerang of the
opposite color and have it hit
him. If he's still the same
color but smaller, do it again
quickly. Fraaz will be stunned,
so get some hits in. Repeat
until he splits into two.

Look at the top screen. See the
color that the split up Fraaz
bodies are? With one Boomerang
throw, have it touch each body
with its weakness. If done
correctly, Fraaz will become
whole again. If not, both bodies
will spew fire and ice around,
so don't get hit. Now that Fraaz
is joined up again, he will
destroy both torches. So how do
we deal with him now? Use his
own attacks against him.
Whatever he fires, will stay on
the stage for a while
afterwards. Use the element
that's against him when you can,
and attack when he's stunned. He
will eventually split up again.
Do the same: wait for the Fraaz
bodies to fire their elements,
then target them with their
weaknesses. Fraaz will once
again become whole. Repeat until
he's dead.
-----------

Phew! Fraaz will explode,
revealing a large white Force
Gem. The Snow Temple's power has
been restored, providing enough
power for the Tower of Spirits
to restore another part of it!
Just two more and the Tower will
be complete... some Spirit
Tracks leading back to the Tower
of Spirits has also appeared.
Grab the Heart Container from
the chest and use the blue light
portal to get back to this
Temple's station.

Speak with Anjean and she'll
tell you that the next temple is
in the ocean, and as usual, we
need to get the Ocean rail map.
So enter the spiral staircase,
climb as far as you can go, and
enter.

Floor 8
-----------
Oh wow, a pitch dark room. The
only light we have are these two
torches by us. Since this floor
is pretty dark, and the top
screen doesn't show a map, I'll
show one here.

Nothing too complicated. There's
two bombable walls here, one at
the far north side, and one at
the middle of the northern
wall's little indent on the
south side near the staircase.
Head north, lighting torches,
and you'll see a bomb flower in
the notch near the northern
part. Grab it, then place it
between the two torches to the
north. Head inside for a rare
piece of Treasure! Return, just
head along the halls, lighting
torches with your Boomerang if
you wish, and be careful of the
Nocturns. When you reached your
destination, go upstairs. (The
other bombable wall can wait.)

Floor 9
-----------
Dang, another dark floor!
There's two Torch Phantoms and
two Tears of Light here. There's
also some pesky Nocturns around.
Here's a map. (Nocturns infest
the top left area)

--------------------------------

Head west from where you are,
lighting torches along the way.
Stop at around the middle, where
there is a pit, and head north
to a safe zone. Two Torch
Phantoms are patrolling the area
to the east, with a Tear of
Light in the center. Grab it,
then make your way to the
northwest side. This place is
infested with Nocturns, so it'll
be easier on you if you just try
to kill them. (They solidfy and
become killable when exposed to
sudden light, so light a torch
as they pass near one. Remember,
you can blow out torches with
the Whirlwind so you can use
them again.) Once all the
Nocturns are taken care of, make
your way to your second Tear.

Now, head back to the south
side. If you read that stone
tablet, you'd know that there's
a secret in the northeast corner
of the area that the Torch
Phantoms guard. You may also
have come across a bomb flower
in a nearby safe zone. Wait
until it's clear, pick up the
bomb flower, and head to that
northeast corner, placing the
bomb flower by the torch. An
opening will be discovered, so
head through. Inside is the last
Tear! Now that your sword is
powered up, go back and have
Zelda possess one of those Torch
Phantoms. Head over to the pit,
light any torches that may need
to be lit with a slash from
Zelda, and carefully follow the
path across the pit.

Get to the far left, light the
torch, and you may catch a
glimpse of a ledge just to the
north. Line Zelda up to it, and
use the Whirlwind to blow her
across. Move her up this
secluded area, and step on the
ground switch to create a bridge
so Link can cross. Go up to
Zelda and open the chest for a
rare piece of Treasure. Head
back to the pit, and get to the
southwest corner, where your
destination is. Light the two
torches with Zelda to open the
door, then head upstairs.

Floor 10
-----------
Wow, how many pitch dark floors
are there? Once again, here's a
map. Keep in mind that not
everything is to scale on these
maps, but I try to be as
accurate as I can.

--------------------------------

The #'s represent a pitfall, to
let you know. Alright, so on
this floor, we have to find the
Boss Key and take it to the Boss
Door. Seems like we'll have to
prepare for something...head
east in this area, chase down
the Nocturns and kill them with
Zelda, then find two switches.
Have Zelda stand on the one on
the northeast corner, and have
Link stand on the other one near
the door. It will open, so head
on through. In this large room,
go north, being careful of the
pitfalls ahead, and go around
the corner into the secluded
area. A few Rats are here, so
kill them. Move t the northwest
corner to find a chest. Open it
for a piece of treasure.

Head to the southeast corner of
this floor to find a red door.
Upon checking it, it wants you
to draw out the symbol that you
can find in this room. Just draw
anything to get out of it. Now,
where to find the symbol? The
key to get that Boss Key is
found in the large room with all
those pitfalls. There are a
number of weird tiles that are
spread out in lines. Follow
them, and you might notice they
form a kind of symbol. Actually,
the symbol is a letter, the
letter "Z". Head back to that
door, draw a "Z", and it will
open! Now, this Boss Key is
electrified, so only Zelda can
carry it. Upon her picking it up
though, a bunch of scary Key
Masters come up. Now you have to
protect Zelda from the Key
Masters as you two head over to
the Boss Door. Thankfully the
floor is lit up during this
time, making it easier to find
the pitfalls and get over there.
To have Zelda throw the key onto
the door, just trace a path for
her into the door until you see
a crosshair. Once it's open, the
Key Masters will disappear. Go
upstairs.

Floor 11
-----------
Finally, no pitch dark floor
here. Uh...but we get locked in
with a Mighty Geozard though.
Remember that Geozard from the
last visit here? Well this red
one is much tougher, has more
stamina, and breathes fire. Use
Phantom Zelda's body as a shield
against the fire, and take out
the Mighty Geozard like you do a
regular one. After killing it, a
big chest will appear, as well
as a way forward. After Zelda
congratulates us, take the rare
piece of treasure from the
chest, then head upstairs.

Floor 12
-----------
That's the end of this visit.
Pick up the Ocean rail map, then
take the blue light portal out
of here. Talk to Anjean, then
you'll set off towards the
Forest Realm, the quickest way
to the Ocean Realm.
----------------

Before we head over to the Ocean
Realm though, let's take care of
some sidequest business. First
off, we need to get us some
bombs. If Beedle isn't here,
find him in the Snow Realm.
Either way, you'll notice that
Beedle's shop is in a hot-air
balloon. To shop, get near
Beedle and sound your whistle.
He will fly down next to the
tracks as near you as possible.
Stop in front of him to shop.
Buy the Bomb Bag for 500 Rupees,
if you have the money, that is.

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Beedle will also notice that you
haven't joined the Beedle
Membership's Club, and offers to
sign you up for a mere 100
Rupees. Go ahead and do so, if
you have the money. Basically,
this membership works in such a
way that you gain a point on
your card with every 10 Rupees
you spend. The more points you
have, the cheaper the items will
be, and your membership might be
upgraded. There are five levels
to your membership: the regular
level, Silver (get 200 points),
Gold (get 500), Platinum (get
1000), and Diamond (get 2000).
Obviously that requires a lot of
spending. Anyway, we're looking
to get the Gold Membership, but
that can wait. Right now, exit
his shop, then make a stop at
Castle Town.


Castle Town
----------------
First thing we're gonna do is
catch up on our mail. There's a
total of three letters and a
package for us at the mailbox!
To get them all, just enter a
house then exit after getting a
letter. One letter is from
Beedle, telling us he's opened
shop. Second letter is from the
guard captain in Hyrule Castle,
wanting us to check out a new
training regimen he came up
with, and the third is another
letter from Beedle about our
joining his Membership Club.
Packaged with the letter is your
own Club Card so you can start
gaining points on it. Now let's
head inside Hyrule Castle.

----------------
Now, remember where the guard
captain's room is? It's the room
on the right in the first floor.
Take a visit and talk to him.
His training regimen pits you
against his three men, and you
must hit them with your sword
many times. If you manage over
60 hits, he gives you a Heart
Container! Sweet. Head back to
Castle Town.

At the northeast area are some
stairs leading up onto the walls
surrounding the town. There's
some blocks in the way though,
but we can get rid of them with
our Bombs! Walk along the walls,
opening chests at either side
for Red Rupees, and stamping
your Stamp Book at the stamp
station here. Get back on your
train, we're gonna do some snow
business.

To get to the Snow Realm easily,
take the west tracks from here.
You may see a stone archway,
apparently already activated.
Sound your whistle and race
through the portal that appears.
You will re-appear at the Snow
Realm, where you activated that
one warpgate before. Yay. For
future reference, mark both of
these gates with the symbol of
your choice (and maybe a short
arrow pointing to which Realm it
takes you to) so that we'll know
offhand where to go. Anyway,
head over to Anouki Village.


Anouki Village
----------------
Head toward Honcho's house.
Along the way, an Anouki might
call out to you. He will tell
you that they're trying to build
a fence to keep monsters out of
their village, but need more
lumber. Well, there's nothing we
can do about that right now.
Keep heading to Honcho's house.
You'll see a crack in the wall
behind his house. Blast it with
a Bomb, then walk inside. Hoo
boy, an ice block puzzle. You'll
have to push this block across
the ice so that it sits between
the two platforms that are too
far apart. Instead of doing the
guesswork, you can just follow
these instructions: push it
west, north, east, north, east,
north, east, south, east, south,
west, and north. Now hop across
to the east and open the chest
for a well-deserved Big Red
Rupee. Exit this cave.

There's something else to get
here as well. Head to the west
of the village. You'll find a
pool of water. Use your
Boomerang to make an ice sheet
on the water with the icy torch,
and move up to the alcove at the
north. Open the chest for a Big
Green Rupee. Now get back on
your train, and haul your butt
over to Wellspring Station.


Wellspring Station
----------------
Get behind Ferrus's house, and
use the icy torch on the other
side of the spring to create an
ice sheet with the Boomerang.
There's a stamp station we can
reach by doing this. Once
stamped, leave the train. We're
now gonna do some rabbit
hunting. Here be a map.

There are a total of five
rabbits we can catch here. Be
extremely vigilant for the far
northern ones, the rabbits seem
to blend in with the trees very
well. Snatch 'em, then use the
warpgate to head back to the
Forest Realm.

See the southeast Spirit Tracks
leading out of the Forest Realm?
Head over there. As you near the
ocean, you'll see that the
bridge we need to cross is out.
Thankfully there's a station
right here, so stop.


Trading Post
----------------
There's just a lone house here.
I wonder who lives here? Let's
go take a look. Just head east,
south, then back west and enter
the house. Huh, looks like a
shop of some sort. Approach the
counter, and someone will make
an appearance... Linebeck!? Oh,
a descendant of his. He's the
spitting image of his
grandfather though... This
Linebeck III will buy any
treasures you possess. In
return, you can get new parts
for your train, or just some
Rupees. I suggest keeping your
treasures until you don't need
them for parts before selling
them. But on other matters,
after humoring him with your
answers, you ask him about the
broken bridge and he says he
can't fix it. However, he knows
a carpenter in the Snow Realm
that could help. I guess we have
to find him. It's fairly easy to
spot him though, he lives at the
only available station we
haven't stopped at yet in the
Snow Realm! If you haven't
marked it, look at the map
above.


Bridge Worker's Home
----------------
Follow the snow-patched path,
killing or avoiding Red ChuChus
and Crows, and enter the house.
The carpenter is there! Talk to
him and he'll make his way to
your train so you can take him
there. May have to talk to him
twice, the first time he
introduces himself. Before
heading back yourself, notice
the four rocks just to the east
of the house? Pick 'em up and
throw them, then play the Song
of Discovery to reveal a secret
treasure chest! Open it for a
Big Green Rupee! Now head to
your train station and you'll
find Ferrus.

He says that the carpenter is a
bit picky and wants you to
follow what the signs on the
Tracks say. If there's a yellow
sign, you have to use your
whistle as you pass it. If
there's an orange sign, you have
to be at normal speed before you
pass it. If there's a purple
sign, you have to be at top
speed before you pass it. Don't
use the emergency brake (reverse
when moving) under any
circumstances, as it makes the
passenger's ride very
uncomfortable. Last but not
least, don't get hit by enemies.
That said, make your way to
Linebeck III's Trading Post back
at the Forest Realm. Remember,
the Tower of Spirits can't be
used as a shortcut. You can use
the warpgate though.


Trading Post
----------------
Once you've taken the carpenter
there safely, head over to the
bridge and talk to him. After a
bit of conversation with you,
him, and Linebeck III, you'll
learn that it'll cost 5,000
Rupees to fix this bridge!
Uh...we don't have that kind of
money...let's go talk to
Linebeck III about this. Once
you do, he tells you to relax,
saying that he's got a plan to
pay the bill. His grandfather,
the original Linebeck, has
buried a very valuable treasure
here. He gives you his
grandfather's letter so we can
get tips on how to find it.
Those tips are:

1. To enter the hiding spot,
   sound the light and follow
   its beam.
2. Inside, go 4 steps north and
   6 steps west from where the
   lights cross.

So, to head over there, exit the
shop and go west into a cave.
There's Like Likes here! These
things can permanently eat up
your shield if they suck you
into their mouths, so try to
keep your distance. The best way
to kill them is to stun them
with the Boomerang, then slash
them until they're dead. Keep
heading north until you see an
exit out of this watery cave,
but don't head out just yet.
Walk to the west side to find
some small platforms, with one
being blocked by a...block.
Throw a Bomb so it lands right
next to the block, blow it up,
then hop across to the stamp
station. Once you've got your
book stamped, take the north
exit out of this cave.

We've got 10 stamps now! Just 10
more to go to complete it.
Anyway, out here, you'll find a
sound stone. Check it to see the
notes are: Purple, Yellow, Red,
Light Blue, White. That's
actually pretty easy. Play those
notes on your Spirit Flute to
learn the Song of Light! Playing
this unearths light crystals
hidden in the ground, and they
shine a beam of light at an
important location. And it does
just that, a light crystal comes
out and shines a beam toward the
sea. Wait, this is the first
clue! "Follow its beam"... Look
out to the sea with the
Boomerang to find a switch. Hit
that, and a bridge will extend
to the small islet to the north.
Head over there and blast open
the crack in the wall. Enter.

Kill the Octoroks, and avoid the
treasure chest to the north,
it's a Like Like in disguise.
Play the Song of Light next to
the crystals to make them shine
beams, then get on the tile
where the beams intersect. Now
for the second clue: "...go 4
steps north and 6 steps west..."
Once you do that, play the Song
of Discovery and a chest will
appear. Open it for your pricy
Regal Ring! Now let's take it
back to Linebeck III! Talk to
him and tell him you've got it.
The carpenter will come by, say
he's finished, take the ring
after some talk, and leave.
Oddly enough, we don't have to
take the carpenter back to his
home. Hey, wasn't the Regal Ring
worth 8,000 Rupees? Shouldn't we
have gotten 3,000 back...?
*checks treasure screen*
...Eheheh...it wasn't
enough...hopefully the guy won't
find out for a while...

Before you leave, you can trade
some of your treasures for Train
Parts right now if you want to.
If you lost your Shield to a
Like Like, don't bother buying
one from Linebeck III just yet,
we're gonna get a better one in
just a minute. Get on the train.
Before heading on to the Ocean
Realm, make your way to Aboda
Village and visit Niko. For
having 10 stamps on the Stamp
Book, he gives you the Shield of
Antiquity. This is the same
shield that Link from long ago
(Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass)
used. What's so special about
this one? You can't lose it! To
actually switch to it, approach
the shield that's on the ground
and tap it to pick it up. Yay!
Now get back on your train and
make way for the Ocean Realm!

Once you've arrived at the Ocean
Realm, there's a station right
close to you. Well, skip it for
now and continue along the
length of the track until it
stops at a station on a small
island. Stop here, obviously.


Ocean Sanctuary
----------------
Here already? Well, this might
go a lot smoother than last
time. Yep, definitely. Nothing
will hinder us. Anyway, head on
northwest to find a Lobarrier.
It's a lobster that acts as a
barrier. Clever name. To get
around it, trace a Boomerang
path so that it hits the
lobster's back and stuns it. You
can kill it then, or just pass
it and enter the cave.

Head through, kill the next
Lobarrier, and eventually you'll
come to a gap with a switch
surrounded by bombable blocks.
There's some bomb flowers
nearby, so you can save your
Bomb ammo. Throw the bomb
flowers across the gap near the
blocks to destroy them. Once
you've got a clear shot, use the
Boomerang to hit the switch,
extending a bridge to let you
cross. Kill the next Lobarrier
as you make your way back
outside.

There are six statue faces
around here, and you must draw
lines showing where each are
facing. To reach the western
one, you must stun the line of
Octoroks with your Boomerang,
then use the Boomy to hit the
switch where the Octos are. To
reach the eastern one, get up on
the high northeastern ledge with
two Cuccos. Pick one up, then
jump toward the island with that
statue. Step on the ground
switch to make a bridge back
across. Pick up that same Cucco
you used and jump to the next
island. Open the chest for a
piece of treasure. Now that you
drew those lines, head to that
red door. It says to "follow the
gazes of the statues. Trace
their paths to open the door."
The statue's gazes form two
diamonds right by each other, or
pretty much, a sideways, sharp-
edged figure-eight. The door
will open! Head inside.

Alright, let's make a duet with
Carben and be on our...aw crap,
he's not here. His sign says
that he visited Papuchia
Village...ah, that must be the
station that we passed before.
Exit. Now, to get back to your
train easily, go to the
southeast side of this area and
move down to the train station
area. Step on the ground switch
to make a bridge extend. Now you
have a shortcut! Get back on
your train and make your way to
Papuchia Village, the only other
available stop here.


Papuchia Village
----------------
Walk through Papuchia and Zelda
will spot Carben up and carried
along the sky by the birds.
Apparently he can't hear us, so
we have to figure out how to get
him down. Talking to the
villagers reveals to us that the
village leader and clairvoyant
may know the answer. Head into
the clairvoyant's house (the
biggest one on the map) and talk
to her. After giving some
information about you through
the DS's mic, she tells you that
there is a secret beside the
lonely tree where the birds fly.
So, head just south from the
clairvoyant's house, stand near
that tree, and play the Song of
Discovery. A sound stone will
appear! The notes playing from
it are: Purple, Yellow, Purple.
Follow those notes with your
flute to learn the Song of
Birds! With this, you can call
birds of any kind to you! This
is also your last Flute song
that you learn!
   _ _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  
  /
O/  SONG OF BIRDS LEARNED
  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  
Since you've already played this
song, it will call the birds
down to you, and Carben will be
back on land. After some
explanation, he boards your
train. Before getting back on
ourselves, head to the northeast
corner of this village and hop
along the islands to the west.
Open the chest that you see for
a piece of treasure. Now get on
your train and make your way
back to the Ocean Sanctuary.
Such pretty scenery...wait, is
that a pirate ship? Oh no, it's
boarding our train!

The next thing you'll see is
Link with Carben in the
passenger car as the train moves
to the Ocean Sanctuary. You'll
have to protect Carben from the
Miniblins that break through the
windows. After a while, a huge
creature with a giant club makes
its appearance...

-----------
BOSS: Big Blin ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This hulking monstrosity sort of
looks like a Moblin. It is
apparantly a pirate leader of
sorts. In this boss fight, you
have to protect Carben from it.
However, he seems to be
invincible, never flinching when
you attack it. Thankfully, it
walks very slow. It has a
powerful swinging arm though, so
when you see it get ready to
attack, get away quickly. If you
get hit, you'll be dizzy for a
little bit. Rub the stylus on
the screen quickly to shake
yourself out of it.

As long as you constantly
distract the Big Blin, it'll
never get close to Carben.
Eventually, it finally keels
over after taking such a
beating. Be vigilant on the top
screen though! A Miniblin may
approach Carben while you're
busy with the Big Blin, and if
it's given enough time, will
cage Carben and take him away,
meaning you'll have to start
over.
-----------

After that ordeal is over with,
make your stop at Ocean
Sanctuary. Remember, make a
smooth stop since you have a
passenger on board.


Ocean Sanctuary
----------------
Now that we're here, Carben will
thank you, and a Force Gem will
appear. Carben will explain that
these things are the embodiment
of a person's energy, and they
appear when a person's heart is
happy or grateful. As they
consist of the same energy that
make up the Spirit Tracks, when
you get one of these Force Gems,
new Spirit Tracks materialize!
This particular Force Gem opened
a small section of Tracks in the
southeast corner of the Forest
Realm. We'll get to those soon.
      __________  ________

      '\                 |
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Carben will return to his
domain. I suggest you follow
him. The shortcut that we opened
up here is your best option.
Once you get there, talk to him
to start your duet with Carben.
The notes you must play are:
Light Blue, Red, Purple. Seems
simple, but this is the first
time you have to skip a note.
(The yellow one.) Make sure you
practice this well before you go
on to the actual performance.
Again, keep the tips I gave back
with the Forest Lokomo in mind.
Once you've finished the duet,
your Ocean rail map will glow,
and tons of new Spirit Tracks
will show up!

Carben mentions that the
entrance of the Ocean Temple is
deep underneath the sea, and
yes, the Spirit Train CAN go
underwater. He gives you a
letter containing the way to get
underwater. Open this once you
get to the train station. It has
a map with "1", "2", and "3"
placed at certain spots of the
Ocean Realm's map. Copy it down,
then trace a path that follows
those numbers. Along the way,
you'll see Ferrus. Stop in front
of him. After some talk, he says
that he found out that some
weird stones in this realm react
to loud noises. Hm...

Trace your path again, and when
you approach the first number on
your map, look high for a stone
structure with a red sphere.
Sound your whistle until the
sphere turns blue, activating
it. Continue until you reach
"2." This structure is on the
north side of the island. Sound
your whistle to activate that.
Now, once you turn the corner
while on the island, watch your
left side. Pirate ships will
appear. Destroy them with two
cannon shots each before they're
able to wreck your train, then
proceed. The last stone
structure is right where the
three is, before a dead-end.
Once all three of those are
activated, a fish head will
appear from the water. Get your
train through there, and you
will be taken underwater.

This is really breathtaking down
here! Kinda scary since we can't
see the bottom though. Just make
your way to the Ocean Temple.
Beware of the Ocean Octoroks
that swim around you. If you
don't kill them fast enough,
they may spray ink on you that
blocks both your screens, and is
hard to get rid of. There are
also harmless Octomines here
that usually drop Rupees when
shot at with the cannon. Once
you approach the Ocean Temple,
an Armored Train will appear to
cut you off. So, you'll have to
go the long way around. Armored
Trains are basically smarter
Dark Trains, with armor. So you
can't even slow them down with
cannon fire. Once you get to the
north of the Ocean Temple, a
Dark Train will appear, heading
towards you. You'll come near at
a circle in the Tracks.
Whichever path the Dark Train
takes (watch your map for arrow
signs), take the other path. Now
quickly make your way inside the
Ocean Temple!


Ocean Temple
----------------
Phew, that was slightly
invigorating. Head up, and enter
the temple.

Floor 1
-----------
Head north. You'll see two ways
to go. The right way is blocked
by constant boulders rolling
down, and the left has Yellow
ChuChus. Go left. Kill these by
either waiting for their
electric current to pass, or
stun them then kill them. There
are four tablets here. They say
that whatever's above each, must
be hit in the order it says.
Write down the proper order on
your map (should be left, right,
top, bottom), then head north.
Run past the arrow shooters,
then head upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Ignore the crack in the wall for
now, and head south. Get your
shield out (just slash) then
stand on the block. It will
carry you west. Just face to the
north so you can block the
arrows that come flying at you.
Once across, head south to
another block. This takes you
around a pit to the other side,
and you'll spot four switches.
These are what you need to hit
in a proper order. Use the
Boomerang to hit them in that
order, and the door on the other
side will open. Get off the
block when you can.

Head north and you'll see those
boulders that you saw falling
down at the first floor. There's
also a switch here, that when
hit, changes the trap door in
the boulder hall. Stand to the
south of the switch and use your
Boomerang to hit the switch.
What does this accomplish?
You'll see. Backtrack to Floor
1.

Floor 1/2/3
-----------
Head back to the entrance and
take the right path. No more
boulders in your way! Make your
way to the east side of this
floor, then go north upstairs.

Go south, kill some Yellow
ChuChus, then head upstairs once
again.

Head west and you'll be locked
into combat with a Snapper. This
human-ish enemy wears a mask and
some...suggestive wear. It
attacks with a whip made of a
Rope. (You know, the snake enemy
from Zelda games) It uses the
whip to...well, whip you, and to
grab ahold of you, pull you in,
and suckerpunch you. If it
manages to grab ahold, make sure
to slash it before it can punch
you. You may also stun it with
the Boomerang before going in to
kill. Once it's dead, a chest
will appear. Open it for your
own Whip!

Ugh...I feel dirty after that
battle. Anyway, now that we have
this, let's go back and get some
things with this item while
we're thinking about it. Head
back downstairs the way you
came.

Floor 2
-----------
Head south to find some wooden
bars high above. Get your Whip
out, then swing across them by
tapping them. On the other side,
open the chest for a piece of
Treasure. Swing back, then head
downstairs.

Floor 1
-----------
Head south. See the spiky vines
arching over a passage to a
chest? Tap the thorns on the
vines while your Whip is out to
snatch them. To throw them, tap
anywhere else. To set them down,
just unequip the Whip. Remove
both thorns, then walk through
and open the chest for another
piece of treasure. Continue
south, then swing across west,
passing the temple entrance, to
a fish head. Pull the fish
head's tongue out with the Whip
to make a chest appear on the
north end of this floor. Head on
over and open it for another
piece of Treasure. Head upstairs
right here.

Floor 2
-----------
Blast open the crack in the wall
to reveal a hole in the wall.
Don't take this just yet. Blast
open the wall on the right of
the staircase to reveal a secret
opening. Head through this one.
Pull off the thorns from the
vines, and continue until you
can't. Hit the switch around the
corner with your Boomerang, and
a wooden pole will appear on the
west side. Return, then take the
left hole you blasted open.
Swing across, then pull the fish
head's tongue to open a door to
the right. Time your swing on
the first pole so that you land
on the block, and have it take
you to the ledge on the right.
Head north to find a stamp
station! Get your stamp, then
return to the third floor.

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Floor 3
-----------
You have two choices here: the
south is closed off for now.
Head north, swing across, and
head east. Watch the map and
wait for the block to line up to
you, then swing to it. Ride it,
then open the chest in the
alcove for a piece of Treasure.
Head back to the central room,
then go west, swinging across,
and heading upstairs.

Floor 4
-----------
The stone tablet tells you how
to solve your next puzzle up
ahead. Keep it in mind, and
follow the hall, swinging across
a gap, to some Yellow ChuChus.
Just Whip them to death, then
pull the fish handle to open the
door ahead. Head on through to
find a long room with three
"piers" over an abyss. There is
a fish handle on the north wall
lined up to each of them. Stand
on the smallest pier and pull
the fish handle to create a
bridge so you can head south.
That was the puzzle! Head south,
then go downstairs.

Floor 3
-----------
Head west to find two fish
heads, with something in the
left one's mouth. It's a sword.
Pull it out with the Whip, and
while still gripping it, throw
it into the other fish head's
mouth. A chest and wooden pole
out of here will appear. Open
the chest for a small key! Now
swing to the north side of this
room and take a left. Kill the
Yellow ChuChus then use the
small key to open the locked
door. Head upstairs.

Floor 4
-----------
Pull the fish handle to the left
to open a shortcut door over
here. Swing east across three
wooden poles, then head south
into a room where you must fight
Helmet ChuChus. These are
simple. Just snatch the helmets
off their heads with your Whip,
then kill them. Head upstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
Head west to fight two Snappers.
Now that you have your own Whip,
these are easier to beat.
Revenge time! Just whip them to
stun them (helps to stun both)
and then go in for sword
slashes. At least this time they
can't whip away your stunning
device! Once they're gone, head
to the west along the narrow
path. Get rid of the Helmet
ChuChu, and reach the end to see
a weird device. Pull it to set
off a propeller! Use your Whip
to grab onto it and HOLD the
stylus on the screen so that
you'll stay hanging on. Once you
get to your destination, head
upstairs.

Floor 6
-----------
You'll have to fight two Blue
ChuChus. These are constantly
electrocuted and can't really be
stunned. How to kill them then?
The fish head here has a
constant supply of those swords,
so snatch one then throw the
sword at a Blue ChuChu to kill
it. Once both are gone, a wooden
pole will appear in another part
of this floor. We can't go
anywhere else from here, so head
back downstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
To get back, just use the
propeller mechanism here. Now
see the fish heads here? Pull
out the swords from all three of
them and you will now be able to
swing across to the northwest
corner. Head towards the
northeast side, pull the thorns
out of the vines, then swing
across. Head upstairs.

Floor 6
-----------
Swing east across, being a bit
careful of the last pole, as
it's a bit lower. Once on the
other side, hit the switch to
make it easy to swing back. Kill
the Helmet ChuChu to the south.
Head west to find a stone
tablet. It tells you to
"remember the placement of the
blades." So, look around the
room and mark the fish heads
that have swords in them on your
map. Walk along the west thin
path, pull the thorns out, then
pull the fish handle past those
vines to make a chest appear.
Head over to it and open it for
a piece of Treasure. Now walk
along the east thin path, swing
across, and open the chest for a
small key. Make your way
downstairs the only way you can.

Floor 5
-----------
Remember the blades you marked
down? Well, we have to place the
blades here in the same spots as
they were in the floor above.
This will open a door, allowing
you on the southeast part of the
floor. Unlock the door to the
south, then swing across to the
east. Go upstairs.

Floor 6
-----------
Almost done with this Temple!
Pull a propeller out, and hang
onto it. Drop onto the block,
then get off on the Boss Key's
platform. Step on the ground
switch to create a bridge across
to the north. Now it's a simple
path to the Boss Door, right?
WRONG. Once you cross the
bridge, a bunch of neverending
Key Masters will show up, so be
prepared to defend the Boss Key
with your life! You can lure 'em
by placing the Boss Key on the
ground so they won't focus on
you, then kill any nearby ones.
Once you've unlocked the Boss
Door, they will disappear. Just
head up.

Floor 7
-----------
Swing across, break the pots for
any health, pull the thorns out,
then head outside. The boss is
at the top, but first you have
to climb up there. Just swing
along until you see a tentacle
with an eye. Pull one of the
tentacle's thorns off, then
throw it at the eye to make it
go away. Keep swinging up,
repeat the strategy on the next
tentacle, then use a propeller
to fly up to the arena itself.

-----------
BOSS: Phytops, Barbed Menace
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This boss is like...a barbed
green octopus. Its head is
covered in purple gunk, and
shoots it at you. It blocks your
path left and right with its
barbed tentacles. What to do?
Well, the preliminary to this
boss gave you a clue. Pull out a
thorn from one of the tentacles,
and throw it at the head. Some
of the gunk will disappear,
partially revealing an eye. Keep
pulling off thorns and throwing
them at the head until the eye
is fully revealed. Pull off one
more thorn and throw it at the
eye.

Phytops will screech, then lay
its head against the side of its
pool. Head over there and slash
its eye as much as you can.
After attacking it, it will
retreat into the water, and out
comes four tentacles. Two of
them trap you in, and two of
them try to whip at you. Avoid
them. Phytops' head will re-
surface, so repeat. After taking
enough damage, Phytops will use
its whipping tentacles while you
have to expose its eye, making
it more difficult. Eventually,
Phytops will be downed.
-----------

The boss will explode, revealing
a giant blue Force Gem! Watch as
the Force Gem's energy is
transferred to the Tower of
Spirits, joining another section
to it. Yay! Spirit Tracks
heading to the Tower of Spirits
from the Ocean Realm has
appeared. Grab the Heart
Container from the chest before
using the blue light to warp out
of here.

Get on your train. Take a path
straight to the Tower of
Spirits! Might as well get this
visit out of the way. If you
come across Beedle, go ahead and
buy something from him if you
need it/feel like it.


Tower of Spirits
----------------
Talk to Anjean, and she'll say
that the next temple to go to is
in the Fire Realm. 'k. Take the
spiral staircase as high as you
can go, and enter.

Floor 13
-----------
Thank goodness there's no dark
floor here! However, this floor
introduces a new enemy: Warp
Phantoms, and Phantom Eyes.
These Phantom Eyes act as...the
eyes for Warp Phantoms. If they
catch you, the Warp Phantom will
warp to you and chase you down.
Yikes! Unlike in Phantom
Hourglass though, these Phantom
Eyes cannot be permanently
killed...most of them, anyway.
There are two Tears of Light we
need to pick up here. First,
take a right, then head north.
Before letting the Phantom Eye
guarding a Tear see you, stun it
with your Boomerang, then kill
it. Grab your first Tear.

Now, there are two torches to
the south. You must light the
southeast one with your
Boomerang and the help of the
lit torch. This makes a chest
appear to the north. Head over
there, not getting spotted by
the Phantom Eye, and open it for
a small key! Awesome. Hit the
switch on the right up here to
make a bridge extend between two
platforms on the southwest
corner. Get up on this high
ledge. Now, see the three fish
heads? The middle one has a
sword. Pull it out with the
Whip, then throw it into the
head on the right, making a
chest appear also in the
southwest corner. If you put the
sword in the left head, an extra
Warp Phantom would've appeared,
and you don't want that.

Swing across to the west, making
sure a Phantom Eye isn't below.
If it does, you're screwed. Keep
swinging west, then south, then
head east. Before swinging
north, stun the Phantom Eye
around the corner with your
Boomerang, then swing across,
kill it, and collect your second
Tear. Swing back, then head on
over to the southwest corner.
Get up on one of the platforms,
then cross the bridge. Open the
chest for a small key. Use it on
the locked door here to open a
switch for later. Head to the
northeast corner carefully, and
open the locked door. Head
upstairs.

Floor 14
-----------
Head south, take a west when you
can, and follow the hall. Stun
and kill the Phantom Eye. Keep
moving, and stun and kill the
next one. Now, get near the Warp
Phantom (he doesn't have to be
on-screen) and clank your sword
against a wall. The Warp Phantom
will move away from its guarding
spot (in front of the last Tear
of Light) to inspect the noise.
Hurry over there without getting
spotted, grab your last Tear,
and wait for the Warp Phantom to
warp back. Strike its back and
let Zelda possess it.

Now that Zelda's a Warp Phantom,
she can warp to any Phantom Eye
that you trace her path into!
Neat, huh? Trace her path
through the walls to the Eye in
the enclosed southern room.
She'll warp there and kill the
Eye. Have her step on the switch
to open the door for Link. Now
just keep her on the Eye's spawn
point so she'll keep killing the
Eyes, and get Link over there.
Open the chest that Zelda is now
guarding for a rare piece of
Treasure. Take Link and Zelda
back downstairs.

Floor 13
-----------
Get on a high ledge, move Zelda
below you, and hop onto her.
Move over to the pit on the east
side, and swing across with your
Whip. Open the chest for a rare
piece of Treasure. Swing back,
get on Zelda's back again, then
move her to a non-fenced side of
the southeast high ledge. Jump
off, open the chest for another
rare piece of Treasure, then
have both of them head to the
southwest corner. Have Link
stand near the switch here, then
warp Zelda to the west side past
the door using the Eye. Trace a
path for her to hit the switch,
then have Link hit his switch
immediately afterwards. The door
will open for Link, so get him
over there, and have both go
upstairs.

Floor 14
-----------
Follow the halls until a Blue
ChuChu pops up. Zelda can kill
these, so let her. Keep going,
kill another Blue ChuChu, then
you'll see a pit of sand. Now,
Link can walk across sand pits,
but Zelda can't, due to the
Phantom's weight. So, have Zelda
stand on the ground switch here,
then cross the sand pit with
Link and stand on the other one.
This'll create a bridge for
Zelda. Get her across, and move
east. You'll see some spikes on
the floor. Have Zelda cross
them, then have her stand on the
weird, red, glowing tile. Have
Link follow the rest of the
hall, and stand on the same tile
on your end. Link and Zelda's
positions will be switched! Now
that Link is here, snatch the
sword from the left fish head
and put it in the right. This
will open the door to upstairs,
so get Zelda to you, then head
upstairs.

Floor 15
-----------
This floor can be a bit
confusing. First off, move Zelda
over the spikes to the east,
then down and around to a
triangle glowing tile. There's
another on Link's side, so stand
him on his, and both characters
will switch positions. Move
east, then north across the sand
pit, and you'll fight a Geozard.
But what about Zelda? Well, now
with the Whip, we aren't as
dependant on her as we used to
be. Snatch away the Geozard's
shield with your Whip, and it
will be defenseless! Just dodge
its attacks, then slash until
it's killed.

Move west to see a block. Push
it west, then north onto one of
the ground switches. Now stand
on the square glowing tile, and
get Zelda to stand on the same
tile on the other side and
switch positions. Have Zelda
stand on the other ground switch
to lower the spikes that we
crossed with Zelda earlier. Get
Link over and reunite the two.
Have them push open the big
doors, and behind it, is a small
key inside a chest! Grab it,
then head back to the center via
the drop-off ledge nearby. Move
them through the west corridor,
and hit the distant switch
across the pit with Link's
Boomerang to make a bridge
extend...across the sand pit.

Warp Zelda to the nearest
Phantom Eye, then walk her
south, west across the bridge,
and south, past some spikes,
into a secluded hall. Stand her
on the circle glowing tile, then
move Link to the identical one
in the central room to switch
positions. Before moving Link,
warp Zelda back across using the
same Eye, and move her to the
most southern switch, which
lowers the spikes. Move Link out
of there, then use Zelda as a
shield for Link against the
boulders so he can reach the two
switches here. Have them step on
both to extend a bridge across
the gap. Now for the two
switches across the sand pit in
the far northwest corner.

Get Link over there first of
all. Now, here's a tricky part.
First, get Zelda as close as
possible. Next, get caught by
the Phantom Eye (wait for it to
appear if you killed it), then
stand on the sand pit. The Warp
Phantoms will appear and
stupidly try to chase after you,
sinking themselves in the sand
pit. Now while they're out of
commission briefly, warp Zelda
to you since the Eye is still on
you, kill the Eye, then have
Zelda and Link stand on each
switch. (Alternatively, I just
found out, is to use the
Boomerang to stun the Eye, then
blow it across the sand pit with
the Whirlwind before warping
Zelda there. Either way works
fine.) This will open the door
in the north central corridor.
Get both over there (just warp
Zelda to the Phantom Eye right
near the staircase) and head
upstairs after unlocking the
door.

Floor 16
-----------
Kind of a tricky floor. Warp
Zelda to the left room with all
the tiles. Now... watch the
Phantom on the right side of the
floor. When it gets to the top
left, start tracing the same
path it takes for Zelda.
Basically, we need to follow
that Phantom's trail from our
green tile to our red tile over
here. If you need to, draw the
path down on your map first.
Doing this, the door will open
to upstairs. Didn't take as long
as the other floors, eh? Head
upstairs once you reunite Zelda
and Link.

Floor 17
-----------
Well, that's it! The Fire rail
map is in front of us. Grab it!
Before we can leave
though...Byrne shows up to try
to foil our progress. Before
he's able to fight, Anjean shows
up and breaks it up. After the
revealing conversation about
Byrne, they start to fight each
other, and Anjean warps both of
you back down to the base of the
tower.

Uh...maybe you were a little
off, Anjean? Ow...my back.
Anyway, talk to Zelda and she
will ask which Realm we want to
go to. Pick the Forest Realm and
you'll head out.
----------------

We've got a lot of things to do
now, mainly Force Gem
sidequests. Make a stop at
Castle Town first.


Castle Town
----------------
A new level to Take 'Em All On
has opened up! Be prepared for a
harder fight through Level 2,
including some bosses. For
beating this, you get a Bomb Bag
upgrade! Yay! (You can use
potions here without
consequence, so if you're
running low, don't be afraid to
use one!)

Now to get those chests on the
roofs of buildings that have
been tempting you for so long.
On one of the roofs is a Cucco.
Play the Song of Birds while
near it, and the Cucco will fly
to you and follow you around.
Lead it onto the walls of the
town, go to the west side, pick
it up, then jump down to the
roof here with a chest. Open it
for a piece of treasure. Now use
the Song of Birds again, lead
the Cucco to the north wall, and
jump south with Cucco in hand
towards the wooden building.
This is a Cucco pen. Go ahead
and throw a few out of the pen
if you mess up. Now bring a
Cucco onto the south wall, and
jump down onto the Take 'Em All
On building. Open the chest for
a rare piece of Treasure, then
get the Cucco in your hands.

Jump north onto the next
building, then north again, then
west. Now this is where it gets
tricky. You must jump onto the
lion statues with the Cucco in
hand in order to reach the
building by the Cucco pen. It
takes precision jumps, but if
you made it, open the chest on
that building for a rare piece
of Treasure! Now to get some
sidequests done. Teacher is
disguised and waiting at the
station. His guise is that he
wants to see the world, but in
actuality, the poor soul is
worried sick about Zelda and
wants to find her. He'll want to
go to Aboda Village, so take
him. Remember the rules for a
safe train ride!


Aboda Village
----------------
Once arrived, he'll pay you a
lot of Rupees for making a safe
ride here. Hey, I think I'm
liking this engineer business!
Get off the train station and
the deliquent who tricked us
with the bees will call you. He
says that he wants to see the
world from way up high, like a
bird. Tell him that you know
where such a place is, and he'll
get on the train. Might as well
do something nice for the little
weirdo. Get on the train with
him.

We're looking for Beedle's Air
Shop. Again, follow the train
driving rules as you head over
to Beedle's. And as tempting as
it may be, don't use reverse to
emergency brake. If you overshot
Beedle's place, just stop your
train normally, reverse, then
stop in front of Beedle's. The
boy will be grateful for
bringing you here, so you'll get
a Force Gem out of it! This will
open up a bit of tracks west of
Castle Town so that you'll have
more room to dodge the Dark
Trains. Speaking of Castle Town,
we'll need to head over there
now to finish up our business.

Castle Town
----------------
There's a woman in one of the
houses (the one south of the
Cucco pen) who is worried about
where her husband may be. So
worried that she wants to find
him. Agree to take her on the
train. Now where her husband may
be? She says that he has an
abnormal obsession over rabbits.
That should be a big enough clue
that you must take her to
Rabbitland Rescue. Thanks to the
new Spirit Tracks shortcut we
just opened up, we can cut right
through the forest from here!
Again, when transporting
passengers, follow the train
driving rules.

Once at Rabbitland Rescue, watch
the funny and somewhat
depressing conversation between
the two. The wife gets mad and
wants you to take her back to
Castle Town. Ugh...after all
that? Fine...let's take her ba--
why isn't she on the train? Talk
to her, and she says she changed
her mind. She says that her
husband's big heart is what drew
her to him in the first place,
so she'll give him another
chance and to take care of the
rabbits with her hubby. You'll
get a Force Gem out of this!
Some tracks starting west from
Rabbitland Rescue and ending at
Forest Sanctuary will open up!

Take your train and follow these
new tracks. As you pass through
one forest and go through a
valley, keep a lookout for a
rabbit to your left. Capture it,
then keep going. There's another
rabbit on your right before you
enter the forest. Capture that
one. Now make your way to
Whittleton.

Whittleton
----------------
Head straight up to the northern
area. Once there, make your way
to the north pit and swing
across. Remember you can blow
away all the leaf piles with
your Whirlwind for hearts,
Rupees, and Treasure. Kill the
Yellow Spinuts and open the
chest for a piece of Treasure.
Swing back, and approach the
middle gap. Swing over it to the
east, then head north to find
one of the villagers by a
blocked off dirt path. Talk to
him and he says that he holds a
whip race minigame here. For 50
Rupees, he'll let us give it a
shot. Go ahead. What we have to
do here is use our Whip to swing
across to the finish line. We
get a good prize if we make it
within a good time.

It's a fairly easy minigame, at
least for me. You have to make
it within 1 minute and 30
seconds, just a tip for you
though: Don't wait for your
swing animation to end before
you swing again. You can swing
again as long as the next wooden
pole is visible. There are some
thorny vine arches along the way
that you'll have to pull away in
order to pass, just be quick on
those. For clearing the whip
race in under a minute 15
seconds, you get a Heart
Container...if you didn't fall!
Try it again, and if you get a
time under 1:30, but not below
1:15, you get the second Bomb
Bag upgrade of the game! Any
successful future attempts will
net you some of the more
valuable Treasure pieces.

Get on the train, and go south
towards the Trading Post.
Instead of stopping there
though, continue south down
those new Spirit Tracks. Keep an
eye on your left for a rabbit as
well. Capture it, then follow
the tracks. You'll see a
warpgate. Hit the triangle up
top to activate it, then sound
your whistle and get warped
away...

We're at the east side of the
Snow Realm! Mark this warp for
later, and stop at Anouki
Village. Head over to the west
near the pool and talk to the
Anouki. He says that this
village is made famous for its
Mega Ice import, but as of late,
a ChuChu got into the pool and
made it grimy and filthy. They
can't make Mega Ice out of water
like that! So this Anouki asks
you kindly if you could take him
some place where there's fresh,
cool, spring water. Agree to
take him, then get back on the
train. Make a safe ride to
Wellspring Station.


Wellspring Station
----------------
Go talk to the Anouki and as
thanks for getting him to a
prime, Mega Ice-making spot,
you'll get a Force Gem! This
opens up tracks to the south,
and a new path to the Forest
Realm! Awesome. He'll make the
Mega Ice over time, but we
actually needed to take him here
in order to progress to the Fire
Temple later on. Before exiting
out of here, get up on the west
end, dealing with White Wolfos,
and swing across to a chest.
Open it for a Big Green Rupee!
Now get on your Train and take
those new Spirit Tracks. Instead
of heading south back to the
Forest Temple though, go west.
There's another warpgate here.
Activate it and take the warp...

Mark this warp, then head west
and stop at the Ocean Sanctuary.


Ocean Sanctuary
----------------
Head north so you're at the
cliff and facing the island to
the north. Play the Song of
Birds and a bird carrying a
wooden pole will fly over. Hang
on with the Whip as it flies you
to the island. Open the chest
for a piece of Treasure, then
have the bird fly you back. Head
to the north part of the
Sanctuary now, and head towards
the west island where the
Octoroks are. Use the Song of
Birds to call another one of
those birds to you. Grab on with
the Whip and release when you're
over the small island to the
north. Open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, then call the
bird back to take you off of
here.

Get near the entrance to the
Lokomo's domain and play the
Song of Birds again to call
another bird. Have it carry you
up on top of the domain
entrance, where a stamp station
rests! Stamp your Stamp Book,
then head back to your train.
Next stop, Papuchia Village.

Head over to the east side, and

pole birds will come. Hitch a
ride, then head south into an
area south of the village. Here,
play the Song of Birds and hitch
a ride to the south island. Get
to the end, play the Song of
Birds again, and hitch a ride to
the middle long island. Head
along north, kill the
Lobarriers, then open the chest
at the end for a Big Green
Rupee.

Now go back, play the Song of
Birds, hitch a ride to the
right, then play it again and
hitch a ride from the bird that
appears to the left, carrying
you to an island west of "long
island." Open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, then play the
Song of Birds again and hitch a
ride to the south island with a

you get dropped off nearby. Talk
to the woman, and say that yes,
you do know someone who could be
a nice husband for her.
Sidequest start! Head on over to
Whittleton back in the Forest
Realm. Take the chief of the
village onto the train, as he
matches the woman's description
of her ideal man. Transport him
to Papuchia Village, and we'll
automatically be at the woman's
house with him. They seem to
connect! Job well done. In
exchange, a Force Gem! This

east side of the Forest Realm,
gaining access to two Grass
Rabbits. Go ahead, get back on

Tracks, watching your right for

A total of seven rabbits can be
found here! Nice. Catch them all
(if you failed to catch one,
just stop at a station and
uncaught rabbits will reappear.
If your train ever gets low on
health, you can sound your
whistle near the golden
dolphins. Three or four whistles
will give you a free heart for
your train to heal with. After
catching the rabbits, make your
way to the Fire Realm, so we can
continue the main quest. Fastest
way there is to go to the Tower
of Spirits, then take off again
to the Snow Realm.

As you enter the Fire Realm, a
volcano will erupt! Now you'll
have to watch out for molten
rocks and shoot them down as you
make your way as far east as you
can to Goron Village.


Goron Village
----------------
Well, this place could look
better. Those lava geysers
certainly don't look like
tourist attractions. Talk to the
Gorons here, and they'll say
that Kagoron should be able to
help you find the Lokomo for
this region. Head west, up some
stairs, and into the next area.
Climb the stairs here, talk to
the Goron and get around the
piles of steel, and open the
chest for a piece of Treasure.
Get back down and head west
along this area, dodging
boulders the best you can. Watch
for falling molten rocks as
well. You'll soon get to a pit
of lava. Swing along to the
northwest corner and move
quickly before you get devoured
by Lava Babas. These enemies can
be downed easily with Bombs.
After they're gone, get your
Stamp Book stamped at the stamp
station, then swing back south.

Hit the switch to create a
temporary bridge leading east.
Quickly swing north, then cross
the bridge. Head north into the
next area to find Kagoron. After
speaking with him, he'll tell
you to return to Goron Village,
and he'll meet you there. He's
got something for our train. So
head back south. Instead of
going the way we came, head
east. Swing across the lava pit,
open the chest for a rare piece
of Treasure, and walk south up
here. Before dropping down here,
follow this high ledge west
until you're around the center
of the area. Drop down south one
tier, then follow this to find a
chest. Open it for a piece of
Treasure. Now head back to the
village.

Walk until you approach a Goron,
and a scene showing Kagoron will
occur. He will have one of his
fellow Goron people to attach a
Freight Car to our Train. Now we
can haul stuff around in our
Train. How exciting. Kagoron
says that we need to bring
something really cold in order
to subside the lava geysers. Get
on your train. Haven't we helped
an Anouki find a new place to
make Mega Ice? I think that's
what we need. Head over to the
Snow Realm, then to Wellspring
Station. Talk to the Anouki, and
ask for Mega Ice. He'll be happy
to give you some for 25 Rupees.
In actuality, if you keep
declining, he'll keep lowering
the price until it's free. This
is the only time you can make it
free, but why bother if it's so
cheap?

Now, it's tricky to haul stuff,
especially Mega Ice. You need to
make sure the train doesn't tip
when taking corners, so be slow
on those. Also, getting hit
makes you lose part of the Mega
Ice. Finally, when in any place
other than the Snow Realm, the
Mega Ice gradually melts. We
need to get to Goron Village
with at least some Mega Ice, and
we get 20 to start with. Seems
reasonable enough.

As soon as you enter the Fire
Realm, look at your map. There's
a Dark Train stationed near
Goron Village, which will try to
intercept us if we take that
path. So, we've gotta head
around north. Just be careful of
the two other Dark Trains as you
make your way to Goron Village
from the north. Keep an eye on
your Mega Ice, and don't dawdle
just to wait for Dark Trains!
Once you've arrived safely, talk
to Kagoron and the Mega Ice will
be used to gain access to the
village! Yay. Now we can speak
with the elder about the Fire
Sanctuary. Head to the
northernmost house and enter.
Speak with the elder, and for
your helpful deeds, he allows
passage towards the Fire
Sanctuary. Head on through.

Follow the tunnel, killing Fire
Keese with the Whip (easier than
using the Boomerang), and going
north until you can't. Swing
left, then step on the switch to
create bridges where you swung
and over the first lava pit you
passed. Head back, cross the
bridge, and follow the narrow
path to a bunch of pots. Break
these from afar, as a few of
them are Like Likes in disguise.
Once they're gone, go north,
then west, past the exit, and to
a chest. Open it for a piece of
Treasure, then go back and take
the exit. Head north to the Fire
Sanctuary.


Fire Sanctuary
----------------
This is the first time we get to
an actual new area without using
the train. Head north, killing
Fire Keese and Fire Babas, then
go around and south to some
torches and more Fire Babas.
Kill those, and light the unlit
torches, making a bridge extend
above. Head south into the
grassy area, kill the Fire
Babas, and light these torches
as well. This will make two more
bridges extend to help reach
something secret. Head back
north, take the stairs, then
cross the bridge to the west.
Head north, open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, then cross
the nearby bridge. At the end is
the stamp station! Get your
stamp, drop off to the south,
then head east into a stone head
puzzle area.

Take not of the direction each
stone head is facing. Notice
that all except two are facing
the center one, whereas the
center one is facing the north
one, and that the two not facing
the center one are looking at
each other. Now read the stone
tablet. It's a love story about
a man who was the center of
attention loving this one woman,
but alas, the woman has eyes for
another man. Eventually, the two
men become friends, and a spark
of light shows the way. This
story is actually a hint to
solve the puzzle. Stand between
the center one and the one to
the right, and play the Song of
Light. A light crystal will show
up, shining a light onto the
door ahead, opening it. Head
through to be at Embrose's
domain! The notes to play here
are: Purple, Yellow, Purple,
Yellow, Light Blue. Keep in mind
the tips and you'll do fine. For
a successful duet, the Fire rail
map will glow, revealing a bunch
of Spirit Tracks surrounding the
Fire Temple. Now let's head back
to Goron Village...there's a few
things we need to learn on how
to actually enter the Temple.


Goron Village
----------------
Once you return, the elder will
tell you that the Temple is
protected with three locks, and
that some monsters stole the
keys. That's one piece of
information. Talk to other
Gorons and you'll find out that
these monsters fly away if you
try to sneak up behind them, and
are sensitive to a certain
sound, your whistle. It has to
be sounded right though, which
is "CHOO-CHOOOOOOOOO!" One short
whistle and one long one. After
that, then you can attack them
and retrieve their key. Seems
complicated, but it's actually
pretty simple. Before leaving,
move to the east, take some
stairs up, then move west. Go
around, cross the bridge, and
open the chest for a piece of
Treasure. Head to your train,
and make your way to the Fire
Temple. You'll see the three
monsters (Snurglars), so take
'em down and take their keys.
Keep in mind that once their
keys are taken, they'll try to
chase you down, so if they get
up to you, do that whistle sound
they don't like, then shoot them
to stun them. After all keys are
gotten, just head into the
Temple.


Fire Temple
----------------
Well...we're here. Let's get
started. Just head north into
the temple itself.

Floor 1
-----------
Ooh, new music for this temple.
Walk north, kill the Fire Keese,
then head left. Follow the hall,
killing Fire Keese and dodging
fire bars, and you'll face some
Stalfos. These things love to
hop away from your sword
strikes, so feed them some
Bombs. Once those are gone, move
south to a new room. See the
special tiles here? These are
pitfalls. Might want to mark
them down, since they aren't
visible on the map. You'll see
why later. Get through the small
maze-ish area, dodging the
electric Moldolas, then go
upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Oho, a minecart! Get on it and
ride it to a treasure chest.
Open it for a small key, then
take a ride back. Go back
downstairs.

Floor 1
-----------
Go down, around, then up the
stairs. Stop, throw the
Boomerang at the switch to drop
a rock panel, then jump down.
Pick up the rock, then carry it
east, past the locked doors. See
the tiny geyser here? Throw the
rock at it, then you can use it
to hop across. Pull this rock
south until you can get to the
left of it, push it east, then
push it back north, then east
against the flame current.
There's another of these mazes
here, except the pitfalls aren't
marked. However, the pitfalls
here mirror the ones in the room
on the other side. So using
that, go around the maze, get
the red potion from the chest on
the south side, then head
upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
The other side of the room, and
there's another minecart! Be
ready to have the cart switch
rails at any time. Slash the
first switch you see to switch
the first rail, then get to a
dead-end. Open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, ride back,
then try the ride again, this
time hitting both switches,
getting you to a room with a
Stalfos and a chest. Kill the
Stalfos, open the chest for a
small key, then ride back. Go
downstairs.

Floor 1
-----------
Take the stair exit out of here,
then open the two locked doors
here to reveal switches. Place a
Bomb near one, then get near the
other one. As soon as the Bomb
activates the one switch, slash
yours. This will open the middle
door, allowing you to head
upstairs. Do so. (You can also
use your Boomerang to hit the
other as you stand near one, to
save Bomb ammo.)

Floor 2
-----------
In here, you'll have to face a
new enemy, named the Heatoise.
Just pronounce it like
"tortoise" but with heat in
front of it. This enemy loves to
hide in its shell and ram you
with it. It always spins in one
direction, and even hits the
wall. There are Moldolas here as
well...make the Heatoise spin
right into a Moldola to
electrify it, stunning it. Slash
its head until it retreats.
Repeat until dead. As a reward,
a chest appears. Open it for the
Bow and Arrows! Nice. Now you
can shoot arrows by holding the
stylus, moving it around to
change the direction, then
releasing to fire. Head east.
Fire an arrow at the eye switch
across the gap to make a bridge
extend across. Cross it, then
head downstairs.

Floor 1
-----------
Shoot an arrow at the arrow
director (the blue orb) and it
will redirect your arrow east to
another one, redirecting it
north, hitting an eye switch.
This extends a bridge, so cross
it, then jump east and open the
chest for a piece of Treasure.
Move back, attack the first
arrow director so it's pointing
north, then pick it up and throw
it at the small platform to the
left. Fire an arrow at it to
redirect an arrow to fly north,
hitting an eye switch and
extending a bridge.

Head over to the arrow director,
attack it until it faces west,
then pick it up and throw it
onto the small platform to the
north. Fire an arrow at it and
it will fly west, hitting
another eye switch, extending
another bridge the rest of the
way. Cross it, head downstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
There's a way further
downstairs, a locked door, and a
stone tablet that says.. we need
a key to open ths locked door.
*facepalm* Head downstairs.

Basement 2
-----------
In here, you'll be locked in
with some Stalfos, but you can't
attack them with sword slashes.
Use arrows, as there is a
regenerating nut here that
constantly has arrow refills.
After they're gone, refill your
arrows, then head south out of
here. Face left, fire an arrow
at the arrow director and it
will shoot an eye switch,
temporarily subsiding the lava
geysers to the right. Swing
across there with the Whip
before the time runs out.

Head north and west, kill the
Stalfos, then hop on the covered
lava geysers so you can get onto
a high ledge. Open the chest for
a piece of Treasure, then swing
south. Step on the switch to
open the door here, allowing
free access to this room. Now
pass the path here without
getting hit by the Blade Traps,
over to the southernmost part of
this path. Open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, then use the
Boomerang to hit a Fire Keese so
it'll light up, and light the
two torches here. This is a bit
tricky, but thankfully the Fire
Keese respawn.

Once the two torches are lit, a
rock panel will fall onto a
geyser to the west, allowing you
to cross over to the staircase.
Head upstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
Inside, you'll face two more
Heatoises. There are no Moldolas
here though, so shoot two arrows
at their heads to kill them. So
simple now... A way will open up
back upstairs using another
staircase, and a chest will
appear. Open the chest for a
piece of Treasure, then read the
signs. They say something about
the order in which you should
hit some eye switches above. You
can see them too, but of course
not reachable. Write the order
down (should look like 2, 1, 4,
3 on your map, the placement of
the number showing which switch
must be hit) then head
downstairs using the left
staircase.

Basement 2
-----------
Follow the hall, killing
Stalfos, and head north to find
an arrow director. Pick it up
and carry it south, placing it
against the wall north of the
ground switch. Have it face
west, then stand on the ground
switch to open the door. Shoot
an arrow at the arrow redirector
to hit the eye switch behind
that door, dropping a rock
panel. Pick up that rock panel,
and place it on the lava geyser
to the north. Pick up the arrow
director, stand on the rock
panel, let it carry you up, then
step onto the northwestern room.
Put down the arrow director and
hit the nearby switch to create
a wooden pole to the east,
allowing a shortcut.

Now kill the Fire Keese here and
pick up the arrow director in
the northeast corner of this
room. Place it on the southern
geyser here, and make it face
northeast. Place the other arrow
director on the east geyser,
making sure it's facing west.
Now, get near the geyser that
got us up here, and pick up the
rock panel on it when you can
reach it. Move over and place it
on the west geyser, then stand
on it. Fire an arrow at the
switch and all the geysers will
burst up. Shoot the eye switch
on your right, then shoot an
arrow at the arrow redirector on
your southeast side, making the
arrow fly and hit the other eye
switch. This will open the door
here! Head through and open the
chest for a small key.

Hit the switch to make the lava
geysers go back down, then pick
up the rock panel and place it
back on the geyser that got us
here. Drop down, swing across
then go north to head upstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
Open the locked door here and
follow the hall to a mine cart.
Start riding it, and when you
approach the south side, ready
your Bow, and take aim at the
eye switches. Shoot them in the
order you need to: the second-
from-the-left first, the left
one second, the right one third,
and the second-from-the-right
last. Don't worry, there's no
time limit, so you can take a
couple of go-arounds to get them
all. Once you've done this, part
of the rail will redirect so
that you can reach a new
staircase. Before heading down,
get back on the minecart and get
out your Bow. As you approach
the southwest corner, the Bow's
sight should let you see a
switch. Shoot it to redirect the
rail up ahead, so that you can
reach an alcove with a stamp
station. Get your stamp, then
ride back to where you were.
Head downstairs. Head downstairs
once more.

Basement 3
-----------
Now we're in a lava-filled room.
Blast away the rock here with a
Bomb, revealing a rock panel.
Throw it at the lava geyser.
Now, look at the sign here. It
shows "blast marks" on some
places in this floor. Mark those
down, as those are switches we
need to slash in order to
redirect us to the right rails.
Hop east across onto the mine
cart. Slash the first switch on
your ride, ignore the second,
then slash the third one. Safe
ride! The stone tablet here
tells you to carry the Boss Key
by cart. Move to the south edge.
See the Boss Key? Use the
Whirlwind to blow it onto the
cart there, then go around. Go
down, swing across, and open the
chest for a piece of Treasure.
Swing back, then get on your
cart.

Both will start moving, get your
Bow out, and shoot the switches
that you need to hit as you pass
them. This will keep redirecting
the Boss Key's cart out of
danger. If successful, you'll
make it to the other side with
the Boss Key. Pick it up and
throw it at the Boss Door. Head
downstairs. Go north, refill
your hearts and arrows, read the
stone tablet to summon the blue
light portal if you wish, then
head upstairs...

-----------
BOSS: Cragma, Lava Lord
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ This
monstrosity is our boss? Well,
it's pretty imposing, but don't
lose your composure! Its main
attack is lifting itself up,
then slamming its fist down onto
the ground. This does a full
heart of damage if it hits, but
also makes molten rocks fall
down to try to hurt you even
more. Some of them contain arrow
refills though, so it's not all
bad. Your objective here is to
shoot an Arrow at the glowing
spot at Cragma's belly when it
lifts up to attack. Cragma will
get angry, then plunge both its
fists onto the ground. Be
careful and dodge this. This
will make a larger boulder fall
down. Blast it away with a Bomb,
or have Cragma crush it, to find
a rock panel. Pick it up and
throw it at one of the geysers
to the right, and use the rock
panel lifted by a geyser to hop
onto the mine cart. Looks can be
deceiving, so you may fall into
the lava a few times.

Once on the mine cart, you'll
ride along rails surrounding
Cragma. You're supposed to shoot
its glowing spots, including the
ones on its hands. As you shoot
the glowing spots, you'll get
higher and higher until you're
at Cragma's eye level. Shoot its
eye with an arrow to finally
stun Cragma, sinking it down to
the floor. The mine cart will
drop you off so you can slash
its head to damage it. Repeat
this elongated process until
Cragma is defeated! Remember,
the falling rocks that fall when
Cragma slams its fist down
sometimes drop Arrow pickups, so
use that to your advantage.
-----------

Cragma will explode, revealing a
large red Force Gem! This will
connect Spirit Tracks to the
Tower of Spirits, and the final
section of the Tower will
connect! Looks like we're done!
Grab the Heart Container from
the chest, then take the blue
light portal back to this
Temple's train station.

Make your way out of the temple,
and train your way over to the
Tower of Spirits. We're gonna
reach the top and get Zelda's
body back!


Tower of Spirits
----------------
Still no sign of Anjean...hope
she's okay. Take the spiral
staircase as high as you can go,
and enter.

Floor 18
-----------
After Zelda says a few words,
take a look at this room. First,
there's a new Phantom type here,
and there are three of them.
These are Wrecker Phantoms, and
if they spot you, they roll up
into a ball and wreck anything
that's bombable. They're quite a
bit faster than you too, so
you'll have to do some fancy
footwork to dodge them if you
get spotted. Your first Tear of
Light is in the southeast
corner, so let's work on getting
that.

Move over there, and destroy the
blocks with Bombs. Be careful
though, the Wrecker Phantoms may
hear the noise and investigate.
Once those are bombed, bomb the
blocks in the way of the Tear.
Grab the Tear once you can. If
you need bomb and arrow refills,
there's nuts that respawn at the
floor entrance that drop those
pickups. Return to where the
entrance is, refill, then head
west, destroying any blocks in
the way. Get to the northwest
corner when you can. Pull the
block west, then pull it north
from the north side when you
can, then push it north the rest
of the way and east the rest of
the way. Move east, pull the
next block west, then pull it
south. Keep moving and step on
the ground switch to make a
chest appear in the northeast
corner.

Head on over there. You'll have
to swing to it. Open it to get a
small key. Swing back, then make
your way to the door in the top
center. Unlock it, then head
upstairs.

Floor 19
-----------
There's another Tear of Light in
this floor. Head east, then go
up the stairs and pick up the
arrow director. Head back and go
to the west and south, passing a
Mounted Miniblin and a ground
switch. Place the arrow director
on the decorated tile, face it
west, then stand on the ground
switch to lower a nearby door.
Use the Boomerang to hit the
arrow director behind the door
(as if you step off the switch,
the door closes) until it points
north, then shoot an Arrow into
the arrow director near you and
it will hit an eye switch,
extending a bridge on the east
side. Make your way over there
and cross it. A Wrecker Phantom
will appear, leaving you right
in its eyesight. You have no
choice but to run and hide. Try
getting it to maul over some of
the blocks though, especially
the ones surrounding the Tear of
Light. Once it's not after you,
open up the southwest corner
with Bombs, then head upstairs.

Floor 20
-----------
Your final Tear of Light is on
this floor! You're also secluded
in a room with a Wrecker Phantom
and a ton of things to wreck.
First, get on the high ledge
here and use the Boomerang to
turn the arrow director so it
faces north. Next, get to the
northeast corner of this room,
and push the block so that it's
between the sandy ledge and the
ledge with a decorated tile.
Next, use Bombs to wreck the
blocks stacked on top of each
other in the southeast corner to
get an arrow director. You can
be risky and have the Wrecker
Phantom do it for you, but yeah.

Grab the arrow director, take it
to the northeast corner, jump
across to the decorated tile,
and place it there. It should
already be facing south, so jump
off. Now, we need to get rid of
the central block structure, so
the easiest way to do that, is
to make the Wrecker Phantom get
rid of it. Just be careful. Once
that's taken care of, head back
to the northeast corner and step
on the ground switch to open a
door, revealing an eye switch.
Shoot an arrow into the arrow
director you just placed and
watch it fly every which way,
eventually into the eye switch.
This opens the door leading to
the last Tear of Light! Grab it,
then strike this Wrecker
Phantom's back to have Zelda
possess it. Now we have some new
puzzles with the Wrecker
Phantom! Now whenever you trace
a path for Zelda, she
automatically rolls around,
wrecking anything she comes into
contact with. She can even stun
other Phantoms! Head back
downstairs.

Floor 19
-----------
Have Zelda stay behind, and when
the coast is clear, hit the
Wrecker Phantom in the back.
Zelda will change Phantom
bodies. This feature will become
important later. Wreck the
blocks if you want to, then head
up on the east side. Wreck the
Mounted Miniblins here, then
wreck the statues blocking a
path to the center. In this
center room, get on the ledge
with the ground switch and use
the Boomerang to turn the arrow
director so it points north.
Shoot an arrow at it and it will
hit an eye switch, revealing a
chest. Open it for a rare piece
of Treasure. Head downstairs.

Floor 18
-----------
Now for a doozy of a block
puzzle. As you probably have
figured out, Zelda can move the
large blocks with ease. Once you
trace a path into one of these
blocks, some arrows will appear.
Trace a path towards the arrow.
How far she moves the block
determines how far the path is
beyond the arrow. Head towards
the southeast corner. Pull the
small block north, go around it
and push it north again, then
push it west so it's out of the
way. Now have Zelda pull the
large block west (there's only
one large block in this corner
that can be moved west), then
have her pull it north. Finally
have her pull it west again.
Now, have Link push the small
block south along the little
hall, then pull it east. Go
around, push it east, go around
again, and pull it north about
three notches. Pull it east
until you can't. Have Zelda move
the other large block here
north, then push the block east
against the wall, then south
onto the ground switch.

Phew. Have Zelda pull the large
block beside her west so that we
can access the rest of this
floor from here. Now let's work
on the northeast switches. Have
Zelda pull the northeast large
block west about two notches.
Get to the small block in the
middle and have Link push it
east until it's a tile from the
east wall. Push it north now all
the way, then east. Push it onto
one of the switches and leave
this be for now.

Northwest corner now. Move the
small block here completely out
of the northwest corner, then
get Zelda to move the large
block onto the two ground
switches. Easy. Southwest
corner. Have Zelda pull the
large block east until she
can't. Now move the small block
to the ground switch on the
southwest corner. You'll have to
go around and push the block so
you can get it on the switch.
Now, have Zelda stand on that
remaining ground switch that
wasn't pressed down and some
spikes will go down. Pass them
with Link and open the chest for
a small key. Before heading back
upstairs in this center room,
head out of it, both Link and
Zelda. Head over to the west of
the floor entrance to find a
large block. Get Zelda to pull
it north, leaving a path for
Link. Move through there and
open the chest for a rare piece
of treasure. Head upstairs from
the center room.

Floor 19
-----------
Go over and unlock the door,
proceeding upstairs. We'll get
the remaining puzzle down here
in a minute.

Floor 20
-----------
Head south and around. You'll
notice the floor has changed.
This means boulders are rolling
against you. It's best to let
Zelda move ahead and hit the
switch on the other side to stop
the flow of boulders. Move on,
and then west, and you will see
a lava pit. Since both Link and
Zelda need to get across, and
Zelda can't carry Link while
she's a Wrecker Phantom, we need
to change Phantoms. Wreck
through the blocks in the south
hall, then make your way
upstairs, after possibly
refilling with the pots and
nuts.

Floor 21
-----------
Walk inside, and have both Link
and Zelda stand on the two
switches. You'll get trapped
into battle! First, you fight
four Stalfos. Just use Bombs.
Next, you fight Geozards. Just
wreck them, but be careful of
the Rats. The battle will be
over, but four Phantoms will
appear. Yikes! Make your way to
the safe zone here and strike
one of the Phantoms' backs to
have Zelda switch. Get outta
here, then return to floor 19.

Floor 19
-----------
Head to the northeast corner,
grab the arrow director there,
then take it to the center room.
Have Zelda pick it up, make sure
it points north, then stand on
the ground switch to open the
door. Move Zelda past the door
and onto the decorated tile,
then shoot an Arrow at the arrow
director, hitting the eye
switch. This makes a treasure
chest appear on your side. Hold
on there tiger, before getting
what's inside, move Zelda out of
that room so she won't be
trapped when you step off the
switch. Open the chest for a
rare piece of treasure. Now, the
only way to get Zelda to drop
something she's holding...you
have to hit her. Why Nintendo
didn't program a command for her
to drop what she's holding, I
have no idea. So just use the
Boomerang or the Whip on her to
make her drop the arrow
director. Don't hit her too many
times though: she'll get angry
and start chasing after you.
Head upstairs here after getting
Zelda to possess the Wrecker
Phantom.

Floor 20
-----------
Make your way to the floor where
Zelda can possess a regular
Phantom, then return to the lava
pit. Move Zelda onto the lava
pit, and hop onto her. Move to
the other side, get off, pick up
the arrow director, then get
back on her. Move to the right
until you see a ledge with
stairs and two of those
decorated tiles. Hop off there,
place the arrow director on the
right of those two tiles, make
it face east, then get back on
Zelda, emerging from the lava
pit on the east side. You'll
find, while on Zelda, some
wooden poles you can swing
across that you couldn't reach
before since they were so high.
Swing across, pick up the arrow
director, then drop onto Zelda
when you move her below. Place
it on the small ledge to the
south, make it face west, then
get back onto the platform you
swung to before. Make sure you
stand on the decorated tile.

Get Zelda over to that second
arrow director, pick it up, and
stand her on one of the
decorated tiles. Now, as Link,
fire an Arrow at the arrow
director to the southeast. This
should hit the eye switch on the
other side, opening a door to
the west briefly. Fire an Arrow
at Zelda's arrow director and it
will hit an eye switch on the
other side of the newly opened
door, opening another door
leading upstairs. Yay! Have Link
swing back, move Zelda to Link,
make her drop the arrow
director, then move both across
the lava pit and head upstairs.

Floor 21
-----------
You're in the room north of
where the Phantoms are in that
battle room. Just follow the
hall and head upstairs again.

Floor 22
-----------
Boss Key and Boss Door...this
must be the last floor. Move
Zelda north past the flames,
then west, south, and over to
the Boss Key, picking it up.
This means Key Masters will show
up. Move Zelda west out of here,
having Link protect Zelda from
Key Masters. Move her north,
then all the way east onto the
large circle tile, having Link
snipe the Key Masters with
Arrows along the way. Once she
is on that tile, move Link
quickly onto the adjacent tile,
switching positions. Move Zelda
quickly over to the Boss Door
and throw the Key in. Now that
the Key Masters are gone, a
bridge will extend across a sand
pit, and all the flames will
dissipate. Move Link over to
Zelda, then head upstairs.

Floor 23
-----------
In here is just some big doors.
Refill anything you need by
breaking the pots, then have
both Link and Zelda push open
the door. Head through. You'll
get locked into a room, and
Byrne will welcome you. He says
something about being "almost on
time", then proceeds to fight
us!

-----------
BOSS: Byrne ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ This
fellow is extremely quick and
agile. He hops around the arena,
occasionally stopping to shoot
some energy waves. You can have
them hit Zelda: she won't be
harmed, and each shot drops a
heart. Eventually, Byrne will
yell, the camera angle will
change, and a purple crosshairs
will appear on you. Move around
so that Byrne's gauntlet will
miss you. Once it's caught onto
the floor, move Zelda to the
hand and pull it, causing Byrne
to fall off. Go over and slash
him as Link.

At this point, Byrne will try
something new. After sending his
energy waves, he'll attempt to
charge up an energy ball. This
is aimed right at Zelda, so move
her around to dodge it, as if
she gets hit with it, she gets
stunned just long enough for
Byrne to throw his gauntlet at
you without any danger. Once he
starts his gauntlet throw, call
Zelda so she'll move with you,
as Byrne will try to hit Zelda
with his gauntlet as well. Once
the gauntlet is stuck, pull it
as Zelda again and slash Byrne.

Now Byrne will try to get up
close and personal, using his
gauntlet to beat up Link and
Zelda. He mostly focuses on Link
though, but if you use Zelda to
try to slash him, he jumps to
dodge. What you have to do is
slash Byrne relentlessly with
Link. He won't be able to block
every attack, so you can deal
some damage. Eventually, Byrne
will start up an attack in which
he charges straight at you. Get
behind Zelda, and when Byrne
charges, Zelda will hold Byrne
in place, leading for you to
slash his back. That's about all
of Byrne's tricks, so keep
dealing damage in that way until
the fight is over.
-----------

Watch the scene as Zelda and
Link high-five each other. The
touching scene is interrupted by
Byrne just walking out. After
it's over, follow him. You'll be
outside the Tower! Follow the
staircase up to the roof, where
Zelda's body, Byrne, and Cole
are. Watch the scene as Zelda's
body gets possessed by Malladus!
Oh no...we were too late! Cole
and possessed Zelda board the
Demon Train and head off to the
Dark Realm. Huh...Byrne was left
behind. Seems he was just a
tool. Oh, Anjean is here! She
says that there's no hope to
defeat him now...
----------------

Link, Zelda, Anjean, and Byrne
all come back to the Spirit
Train's passenger car. After
some talk, Anjean says that
there might be hope of defeating
Malladus if we obtain the Bow of
Light. Sounds great! Uh...but
Anjean also says that even if we
do exorcise Malladus out of
Zelda's body with the weapon,
there's a chance that her spirit
may not be able to re-
enter...well, that doesn't sound
good. We still have to try
though, there's that chance that
Zelda can come back! The Bow of
Light can be found in the Sand
Temple. Anjean will also give
you a Force Gem, which opens up
Spirit Tracks throughout the
Sand Realm, which is a sub-area
of the Ocean Realm. We'll head
automatically to the Ocean
Realm.

Make your way to the Sand Realm
from here. Move your train all
throughout the Sand Realm,
taking in the scenery and
defeating Malgyorgs. You may
have noticed that there are some
large stone faces. Drive around,
finding four of these things.
Draw lines to show how they're
facing, then stop at the Sand
Sanctuary.


Sand Sanctuary
----------------
Look around this place. You'll
notice that it's shaped exactly
like the Desert Realm. Now take
a look at the Rail Map. See the
lines you drew? Go to the
general area where the lines
should cross. It's not always
exact, but what you need to do
is to Bomb the northeast corner
of the square of sand where the
lines are intersecting. This
should create a staircase! Go
down it. Follow the tunnel and
you'll be at Rael the Lokomo's
domain! Time for another duet!
The notes you have to follow
are: Green, Silver, Light Blue,
Silver, Light Blue, Green. Those
are a lot of notes, but just
remember the tips and you'll be
fine. For completing this duet,
the Ocean rail map will start
glowing, revealing new Spirit
Tracks! These lead to the Sand
Temple, but first you have to go
through three trials to reach
it.

These three trials are:
encounter the big eye that looms
in the shadows, navigate the
twisted tunnels, face the
impenetrable temple. Get back to
your train and let's take off.
You'll notice the path to the
Sand Temple isn't directly to
it, rather we'll have to
navigate through part of the
Fire Realm first. Take the
Tracks up to the Fire Realm to
face your first trial: another
Rocktite enemy in the caves.
This is defeated the same way as
the Rocktite in the Snow Realm,
except there are some explosive
barrels you can shoot to make
the Rocktite open its eye.

Once the first trial is taken
care of, you'll have to navigate
the twisted tunnels. Without a
guide, this is simply a matter
of trial-and-error, marking off
which tunnels send you back to
the beginning. However, since
this is a guide, I'll tell you.
Go forward until you see a fork
in the tracks. Go reverse back
through the tunnel you just came
through. When you re-appear, go
reverse again. Finally, when you
re-appear at another fork, take
a right. You'll be out of the
twisted tunnels and back in the
Ocean Realm part of the Sand
Realm. Now for the third trial:
Approach the Sand Temple and
you'll find various cannons
guarding it. Shoot them all down
from all four sides, and the
Sand Temple will open. Drive in.


Sand Temple
----------------
This is it, the final temple.
It's also the hardest one so
far. Psyche yourself up and head
north inside the actual Temple.

Floor 1
-----------
Head north, and you'll find that
you may have a lot to do.
Nothing to worry about though,
we can't do much here except
head east to a boulder hall.
Now, you'll have to cross this
hall while dodging the boulders.
It's really simple though, easy
to read the boulders' pattern.
Just don't step into the
supposed safe area on the left,
as it's a pitfall. Once at the
other side, you'll come to a gap
and more boulders rolling east.
There's an eye switch on the
north wall. Simply shoot the eye
switch when you have enough room
between the boulders to activate
it, opening a room to the west.
Open the chest for...a Green
Rupee? Must be a trap.

And indeed it is! Three Stalfos
will come up from the sands.
Now, these Stalfos keep showing
up if you take too long to kill
them all. You shouldn't really
worry about that if you use
Bombs though. Open the chest
that appears to get a small key!
Head back east, then south down
the boulder hall, into the
central room. Head north, unlock
the door, then head upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Jump off here, then head south.
You'll see a new enemy named
Gerune. There are two of them
here, but they cannot be
defeated right now. Head east,
then north to a sandy area.
There are three rolling spike
logs here, just squeeze your way
through to the north, heading
upstairs.

Floor 3
-----------
Head south into a room of
Stalfos Warriors. These upgraded
Stalfos enemies use swords for
combat, and swing it wildly as
they approach. However, still a
single Bomb can disintegrate
them. Once they're gone, a door
will open. Head west through it,
then follow the shrine to a
chest. Open it for the Sand
Wand! With this, you can
manipulate the sand and allow
you to reach high areas!

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Since you took it, rumbling will
happen in the lower floors. I
wonder what's changed? Let's
head back to where we fought the
Stalfos Warriors, get under the
left ledge, then use the Sand
Wand to raise the sand you're
on, allowing you to exit back
downstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Head south to find that the
rolling spike logs are now
completely side-by-side,
blocking passage. Use the Sand
Wand to raise the sand and stop
some of the spike logs, allowing
passage. Before you move on out
of this room though, first use
the Sand Wand to raise the sand
under Link and by the left
alcove, allowing you to open the
chest for a Red Rupee. There's
another chest here too, but it's
a little trickier. Keep the sand
raised by hovering the Sand
Wand's orb, and stop the
rightmost spiked log so it lines
up with the right alcove. Walk
along the log and open the chest
for a rare piece of Treasure.
Exit this room southward, then
back west.

Now for those Gerunes. With the
Sand Wand, you can now kill
them. Use the Sand Wand on them
to harden them and make them
brittle. They'll try to run
away, but just keep it at 'em.
Once they're fully brittle and
stop moving, slash them to
defeat them. For killing them,
the doors will open. Head north,
avoid the rolling spiked log,
and raise yourself onto the
north ledge. Now, see the ground
below to the south that doesn't
have sand? We need to stop this
spiked log on there, so we can
cross it and head downstairs. Do
so.

Floor 1
-----------
Now we're getting somewhere.
Head to the west side of the
sand pit here to see another
level of sand, and a chest on
another higher level. Use the
Sand Wand to get you up there,
and open the chest for a piece
of Treasure. Now, get back down,
and head west. Roll both pillars
west into pits. Raise yourself
up to where the higher one was,
then head north, then west into
a sandy room with eye switches.
Now, we'll have to shoot all
three of these eye switches in a
limited time. First, raise
yourself so you can shoot at the
two eye switches above, then
drop down to the north and shoot
the last one.

The door to the east will open
up, so head through. You'll see
another of those pillars. Get
into the alcove in the right,
and push the pillar south. Head
north, raise yourself up to the
northwest ledge. Now, to get
across, push the pillar back
north so it creates a bridge for
you. Cross it, then push the
pillar south again so it creates
another bridge. Cross it, then
head west into a room with two
Gerunes. Take them down, and a
chest will appear back east.
We'll get over there in a
minute. Head north, and use the
Sand Wand to get you into the
room with the map. Take a look
at it.

"Between one and three...is
where...the key...hides..." Hm.
This weird diagram actually
shows us something. Remember
those three eye switches we hit?
Mark that place. Now, remember
the eye switch in the northeast
corner in which we had to shoot
between boulders? Mark that.
Draw a line between those two
marks, and in the middle,
somewhere in the sand, is where
the small key should be. Use the
Sand Wand to get you out of here
(via south way), then cross the
pillar and open the chest for a
Red Rupee. Fall down south, then
head towards the boulder hall.

The boulders roll almost next to
each other, so we can't squeeze
between them like we could
before. Instead, get on the
small sand pit and raise
yourself up to the long ledge on
the right. Follow it, then wait
for an opening. Rush through to
the other side. Now you'll have
to shoot the eye switch again to
open the door ahead. Boulders
are in the way though. Just push
them aside with the Sand Wand
before you shoot the eye switch.
Continue west, and you'll face
new enemies. These are
Ergtoroks. They're just like
Octives and they attack the same
way, but defeating them is
different. First, they dig
around in the sand, and it's
visible as sand kicks up where
they are. Use the Sand Wand
where the sand is kicking up and
it will raise the Ertorok up,
trap it, and stun it. Get up on
the Ergtorok's level using the
Sand Wand on yourself, then
slash it to kill it.

Killing all three of them makes
a chest appear on the upper
ledge to the west. Get up there
using the Sand Wand, then open
the chest for a Red Rupee. Now,
start raising sand up here in
the general area where the small
key should be, and you should
find it! Grab it then fall down
the south way with the Sand
Wand. Now for the final puzzle
of this room, and it's rather
simple. Just push the boulder
onto the catapult, then hit the
switch to fling the boulder at
the cracked wall, breaking it
apart. Head downstairs.

Basement 1
-----------
Use the Sand Wand on the
quicksand pit here to create a
safe "bridge" across, then
cross, open the locked door, and
head through to find more
Gerunes. You don't need to kill
these though. See the two ground
switches here? There needs to be
something to keep them pressed
down...harden the two Gerunes,
then pick them up, placing one
on each switch. Now you can head
east out of this room, into a
river of quicksand. You'll have
to be careful here. Use the Sand
Wand to create a place to walk
on, and head west. Move around
north and east, dodging the
arrow shooters, to a stamp
station! Get your well-deserved
stamp, then head back, going
east this time.

       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Keep your eye out for the arrow
shooters, we don't want your
progress hindered and fall into
the quicksand. Once at the other
side, you will come to a block
pushing puzzle. Ugh. There are
two sides to this block: a
pointed blue side, and a circle-
ish pink spot. We need to push
the block using the Sand Wand so
that its blue side sits on the
blue panel in the center.
There's many solutions for this,
but this seems to be the fastest
way (thanks to ZeldaDungeon for
providing this solution): south,
east, south, east, north, west.

This opens a door to the south,
so head through. You'll spot a
boulders rolling to the south, a
catapult pointing south, and a
ground switch. Step on the
switch to extend a bridge...for
as long as Link is standing on
it. Now, stop the boulder using
the Sand Wand, then move it onto
the catapult. Shoot the switch
with an Arrow from here and the
boulder will fly south,
destroying the cracked wall
ahead. Now...stop another
boulder, and move it carefully
onto the switch, so that Link
can cross. Head west.

You'll see a block-moving puzzle
here, with four panels here and
two of those blocks. We need to
move the blocks' pointed blue
sides onto the blue panels
first. Here's the best solution,
thanks to ZeldaDungeon:

Left Block: east, east, south,
west, south, east, east (on the
panel), east,
 south.
Right Block: west, west, south,
east, south, west, north, west.
Left Block: north, west (back on
the panel)

Move west through the newly-
opened door, using the alcove to
help you pass by the rolling
spiked log, to the western side
of the floor. Kill the Stalfos
Warriors, and open the chest
that appears for a piece of
Treasure. Head north to find two
rolling spiked logs. Stop the
southern one so it's in line
with the ledge to the south,
then raise yourself and cross
along the log. Step on the
ground switch to open the door
to the north. Now stop both
spiked logs so that they're even
with each other, providing a
bridge over to the newly-opened
door. Cross it.

You'll be locked in a room with
Ergtoroks. Nothing to it, just
defeat them, and move northward
into a seemingly empty room.
Raise all the sand here. You'll
find various goodies (including
a Big Green Rupee), but above
all, you find the Boss Key! Pick
it up then start heading back to
the southern block-pushing room.
This time, we have to push each
block's jutted pink side onto
the pink panels. Once again,
here's the best solution, thanks
to ZeldaDungeon:

Left Block: west, south, east,
north, west, south, and east
Right Block: north

Pick up the Boss Key, head over
to the quicksand river to the
north, place it beside you, then
quickly create a bridge with the
Sand Wand, pick up the Boss Key,
cross with it, and throw it onto
the Boss Door and open it. Head
downstairs.

Basement 2
-----------
Head north, using the Sand Wand
to reach the pots to refill if
you wish, read the stone tablet
to make a blue light portal
appear just in case, then head
inside. Approach the structure
in the center.

-----------
BOSS: Skeldritch, Ancient Demon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This giant skull on a tower of
armored bones awakens! It uses
two attacks: throws a boulder at
you, and uses a piercing laser
attack. Just constantly roll
(but not so much that you get
yourself dizzy) to avoid the
laser attack, and stop the
boulder with a big barrier of
sand using your Sand Wand. While
the boulder is stopped, move it
onto one of the catapults. Take
care to move away when you see
Skeldritch summon another
boulder, as when two boulders
collide, both disintegrate. When
the boarded catapult is lined
up, hit the switch and the
boulder will fly into
Skeldritch, breaking apart a
section. Repeat this again for
the next section, just make it
known that he throws three
boulders this time.

Skeldritch's next section does
not have its weak spot in the
front like the previous two this
time: it's on Skeldritch's right
side, with armor covering the
rest. Take note that Skeldritch
always faces you...stop a
boulder, place it on a catapult,
then move until you see the
boarded catapult on the right of
Skeldritch. When the coast is
clear for you, shoot that
catapult's switch with an Arrow,
flinging the boulder and
breaking apart that section.

Skeldritch's next section has
its weak spot behind him. Do the
same thing you did before: board
a catapult with a boulder, move
until it's behind Skeldritch,
then hit the switch with the
Boomerang this time, so you can
get it around Skeldritch. Take
note though, Skeldritch now
fires three super fast boulders.
You'll have to create an
extremely thick wall of sand to
stop these boulders. The next
section has its weak point on
the left. Again, use the same
strategy as you used for the
previous section, Boomerang and
all. This time, Skeldritch fires
four of those super-fast
boulders, so take heed.

Now that only a skull remains,
Skeldritch's helmet has fallen
off, revealing its vulnerable
head. It will now chase after
you relentlessly. Use the Sand
Wand to create a wall of sand in
front of it to stop it
momentarily, then quickly get
behind it, raise yourself, then
do a series of slashes. Repeat
this until Skeldritch is finally
bested.
-----------

Skeldritch explodes into a gust
of smoke, and a staircase
leading down appears. Open the
chest for a Heart Container,
then head downstairs. Hop down,
then head north through the
shrine. Open the chest to get
the sacred Bow of Light! Now you
can charge up your Arrows with
light! Simply hold the stylus on
the screen until light charges
up, then fire. A blue light
portal will appear, but it's out
of our reach. Fire a Light Arrow
at the large eye switch to
extend a bridge. Head into the
portal to get warped back to the
train station. Enter the train.

Zelda will come rushing in,
happily telling Anjean that they
have the Bow of Light. Now we
can find Malladus and be on our
way! ...Unfortunately Anjean
can't help us there. Byrne wakes
up, and says we need the Compass
of Light to find the Dark Realm
where Cole and Malladus are
stationed. Har har, get it?
"Station"ed? ...Eh. He says it's
hidden deep within the Tower of
Spirits, so it looks like it
hasn't been fully explored yet!
Before we move on, Anjean gives
us another sacred weapon: the
Lokomo Sword. This was also used
to best Gano--I mean Malladus
long ago. Well, awesome! Now we
got us a new, more powerful
sword!

But seriously, a bow that uses
Light Arrows, and a sword, both
being the only weapons needed to
kill Malladus? Doesn't that
sound too much like Ganon? Meh.
It's probably unoriginality on
Nintendo's part. Anyway, you'll
be heading out of this area of
the Desert Realm. Instead of
going through all that hoopla
again though, when you get to
the turn-off towards the Fire
Realm, go straight. There's a
warpgate here. Activate it, then
take the warp. You'll appear on
the west side of the Desert
Realm! Now just make your way
back to the Tower of Spirits.


Tower of Spirits
----------------
Head up the spiral staircase
until you reach a blue light
portal. Take it, and you will
appear at floor 23. Head
upstairs, through the room where
you fought Byrne, out to the
outer staircase. Climb to the
top. There's a stamp station all
the way up here. Get your stamp,
then shoot the large eye
switches with Light Arrows. The
center will rise, revealing a
staircase. Head downstairs.
Refill anything you need in this
room, then head downstairs once
more...

-----------
Yep, we're not done yet here! A
Phantom will appear in the lava
pit to the northeast. Zelda
mentions that since the Lokomo
Sword is filled with energy, we
don't need to collect Tears of
Light. Well that's a relief.
Anyway, we can't do much of
anything on this floor, so head
north, then go downstairs.

Floor 29

Good grief, another dark floor.
I'll give you a map of it, as
accurate as I can.

--------------------------------

As you can see from the game,
you're in the northwest area of
this floor and can't go anywhere
else. There are two Phantoms
here, so be careful. There's two
torches in the far southern
corner from here, but as there
are no other sources of light
except for here, you can't
access that just yet. Instead,
sneak up on one of these
Phantoms, strike its back, and
have Zelda possess it. Move back
upstairs.

Floor 30
-----------
Move south and have Zelda cross
the spikes on the east, stepping
on the floor switch to lower
them for Link. Now for a puzzle
in this lava room. Get on Zelda,
head east and kill a Fire Keese,
then head to the north side,
killing more of them. Make sure
you don't get spotted by the
Phantom walking around here.
Move to the east safe zone so
you don't get spotted, and get
right on the southwest corner.
Use the Boomerang, and you'll be
able to juuust hit the south
switch. Before hitting it, move
Zelda beside you on the lava so
you can hop on her. When the
Phantom isn't nearby or
approaching, use the Boomerang
to hit the south switch. Now you
need to hit the north switch in
a short time, but you can't
reach it from the safe zone. Hop
on Zelda move her a little bit
west, and that should be enough.
Use the Boomerang to hit the
north switch and the door nearby
leading downstairs will open.
Head down.

Floor 29
-----------
Back at the dark floor, refer to
the map above. You're in the
northeast area of the floor,
with some Nocturns guarding the
area. However, Nocturns can be
killed with Light Arrows, now
that we have the Bow of Light.
Makes 'em easy, huh? Move to the
far northern corner here to find
a torch beside a stone tablet.
It says that sometimes darkness
can open a path. Blow out all
the torches around here with the
Whirlwind, and a door will open,
leading to the Torch Phantom
just west of this place. Head
over there, strike its back, and
get Zelda to switch to the Torch
Phantom. Phew, now getting
around this place will be much
easier. Light the torch around
here, then head south towards
the center, near a door. Light
that torch, then return east and
go upstairs the way you came in.

Floor 30
-----------
Get on Zelda, move to the other
side of the lava pit, then go to
the north, downstairs once
again.

Floor 29
-----------
Head to those two torches in the
far southern corner, being
careful not to get seen by the
Phantoms, and light them with
Zelda. This will open another
staircase, this one leading
downstairs. Take it.

Floor 28
-----------
Time to use our Sand Wand for a
little bit. Climb up and to the
north. Drop down (leave Zelda
behind) and kill the Stalfos
Warrior. Now, trace a path for
Zelda to one of the torches in
the corners up here, using the
Sand Wand to create a safe path
for her as she moves. She'll
light the torch you got her to,
so draw another path for her to
the other torch and use the Sand
Wand to make her a path. Once
both torches are lit, two chests
will appear to the south. Get
both characters out of this
room, then head south, killing
all the Stalfos Warriors.

Get back north, and move to the
highest spot. Get on Zelda, then
use the Sand Wand to create a
path for Zelda to carry you. We
need to move to the southwest
corner. Once you do, get off
Zelda while near the chest and
open it for a piece of Treasure.
Get back on her, then make a
path east. Once you get to that
east ledge, hop off onto the
chest's level and open it for a
small key! That's one of three
we need to get. Get back on
Zelda, trace a path back to the
staircase, and make the sand
path as you go. Head upstairs.

Floor 29
-----------
Now, there's a secret we can
find out here. Have Zelda talk
to the Phantoms and you'll find
out there's a weak wall in the
northwestern corner of this
room. Blast it away to find the
way! This passage takes us to
the west section of Floor 30,
but we'll get to that soon.
Right now, just head to the
other side and go upstairs.

Floor 30
-----------
Take the downstairs staircase
past the lava pit.

Floor 29
-----------
Now to switch Phantoms. Next for
us is a Warp Phantom. Follow the
floor southwest until a Warp
Phantom shows up. Use the map
above as a reference if you need
one. Light the torches here,
then read the stone tablet
that's near the Warp Phantom. It
says to shoot the eyes in the
dark with light. First, we need
to have Zelda possess this Warp
Phantom. Have her get on the
Phantom's left side and get her
to strike a conversation.
Meanwhile, sneak up behind,
strike, and Zelda will switch.

Now that Zelda's a Warp Phantom,
we're free to hit this large eye
switch with a Light Arrow. Do
it, and a torch will light in
the southeastern area of this
floor, revealing another large
eye switch. That's for later.
Right now, we need to head to
the northwestern area of this
floor. You should know how by
now. Just be wary that the Torch
Phantom here has re-appeared,
you'll have to get around it.
Once you're there, take that
path you blasted open, through
some halls, and emerge at...

Floor 30
-----------
This seems like a pleasant
little room. Head south to find
a stack of blocks. Blast them
apart with Bombs to find a
chest. Open it for a rare piece
of Treasure. Now, get on the
sand pit, raise yourself up, and
hop on Zelda. Move to the north
upper ledge, hop off there, and
step on the switch. This makes
two Phantom Eyes and a Warp
Phantom to appear on this floor.
Move south and have Link stand
on the circle tile. Now, trace a
path for Zelda to the Phantom
Eye, but don't release the
stylus until the Eye is above
the other circle tile. Release
to warp, and both of you will
switch positions. Move Link to
the right quickly before he gets
spotted.

Warp Zelda over when the Phantom
Eye is over solid ground east of
the sand pit, then move her to
Link. Now get Link onto the sand
pit here, raise him up, then get
on Zelda. Move north past the
spikes, then jump off. Head
north towards the Warp Phantom.
Get spotted, then run onto the
sand pit. The Warp Phantom will
stupidly follow you and sink
down. Hurry back to where it was
stationed, and shoot the large
eye switch with a Light Arrow.
This opens a door far to the
south, so hurry back south. Get
on Zelda using the Sand Wand on
the sand, then move south past
the spikes. (Didn't even need
those triangle tiles...)

Move east to another part of
this floor, while still on
Zelda. Kill the Mounted
Miniblin, then look towards the
pit here. Use the Boomerang to
hit the arrow director until it
points north, then fire a Light
Arrow at it to hit a large eye
switch, opening the door here.
Hop off Zelda, then go
downstairs.

Floor 29

We're now at the southeastern
area of this floor. Refer to the
map above to get your bearings
straight. We're gonna switch
Phantoms for Zelda yet again,
this time it being a Wrecker
Phantom, which is patrolling
this small area. Just head right
over, strike the Phantom's back,
and switch. Now shoot the large
eye switch here with a Light
Arrow to make a chest appear.
Before heading back to get it,
light the only unlit torch here.
This will open up the other two
doors, allowing free access
through the whole floor. Head
back east, open the chest to get
a small key, then head upstairs.

Floor 30
-----------
Wreck the stacked blocks to the
north to find another chest.
Open it for a third small key.
Move west, then north when you
can. Wreck the statues so that
you now have full access
throughout this floor. Head back
downstairs the way you came in.

Floor 29
-----------
Just head downstairs from the
southern center staircase.

Floor 28
-----------
We have three locked doors here
to choose from. Zelda will ask
you which one to take, but it
doesn't matter what you choose.
As Zelda's already a Wrecking
Phantom, unlock the right door
and follow the hall downstairs.

Floor 27
-----------
You'll be shown three large eye
switches that you have to shoot
at. They're all in different
places in this floor, so we'll
have to tackle stuff at a time.
Head south to find boulders
rolling from the north. Move
Zelda through the boulder hall,
northward, and hit the switch at
the other end to stop the
boulder flow. Move her back
south, past the hall where we
entered, up to a high room with
some blocks. Wreck them, then
kill the Phantom Eye. Get Link
over there, and read the stone
tablet. It says: "Light them in
this order. The undefended
flame, the flame surrounded by
sand, the flame surrounded by
the abyss, and finally, the
guarded flame."

Where are these torches you must
light? In a room just west of
here. Observe it (you can trace
a path for Zelda over to it to
look around, though you can't
get her there), then mark down
the torches you see with
numbers, showing the order you
have to light them in. Move
north through the empty boulder
hall, then west. Go south in
this new room, and have Zelda
wreck the statues and blocks.
That's all we can do now.
Backtrack and head upstairs back
to Floor 29.

Floor 29/28
-----------
Pick up a Warp Phantom, then
head back downstairs. Unlock the
left door, then follow the hall
downstairs.

Floor 27
-----------
Three Phantom Eyes will appear.
Warp Zelda to the Eye on the
south, move Link along the sand
as well. Step on the switch to
raise some ground from the sand,
in case you brought another
Phantom here. Get on Zelda using
your Sand Wand, and move south
to find a wooden pole over a
pit. Swing west across, then
step on the switch to extend a
bridge for Zelda. Move north to
a big sand pit. A Warp Phantom
and a new Phantom Eye will
appear.

Kill the Stalfos Warrior, then
get on the south side of the
ledge where the Warp Phantom is.
Once it faces north, use the
Sand Wand to get you up there,
strike its back, and have Zelda
possess it. Now move Link onto
the little raised platform, to
keep that Phantom Eye from
annoying you. Now trace a path
for Zelda west to the arrow
director, making sure to create
a Sand Wand path for her. Once
she's picked it up, Boomerang it
until it points north, then
shoot a Light Arrow at it to hit
a large eye switch. Two more of
those to go.

Move Zelda back to where Link is
with the help of the Sand Wand,
then make her drop the arrow
director. Now drop down to the
sand pit to the east, kill the
Stalfos Warrior, then have Zelda
cross this pit with the use of
the Sand Wand. Get Link to stand
on the circle tile, then warp
Zelda to the eastmost Phantom
Eye. Once she's there, walk her
to the other glowing tile, and
they'll switch positions. Move
Zelda onto the floor switch and
a door will open near Link's
position. Approach the pit and
look to see an arrow director.
Shoot a Light Arrow at it to hit
a large eye switch! One more to
go, but now we need to switch
Phantoms. Warp Zelda over here,
then move to the northeastern
staircase. Head upstairs.

Floor 29/28
-----------
Head back to Floor 29, switch
Zelda to a Torch Phantom, then
get her back down to Floor 28.
Unlock the middle door, then
follow the hall downstairs.

Floor 27
-----------
You'll be right at the torches
here. Have Zelda light the first
one (the undefended flame), then
use the Boomerang to light the
lower right then the upper right
torches (the flame surrounded by
sand, the flame surrounded by
the abyss), then have Zelda
light the final one (the guarded
flame). This makes a door open.
Head over there and shoot a
Light Arrow at the final big eye
switch and a door leading
downstairs will open. Have Zelda
kill the Phantom Eye in the way
first, then head north to go
downstairs.

Floor 26
-----------
You'll have to battle your way
through this floor. First, you
face 9 Blue ChuChus. You'll have
to let Zelda take care of these.
Next, you'll face 8 Stalfos, 4
of them being Warriors. Just use
Bombs. Zelda can help too. Next,
you'll face three Mighty
Geozards. Snatch their shields
away with the Whip first, then
have Zelda take on one while you
take care of another. Kill the
last one, and you'll have
cleared this floor! Phew. Head
downstairs.

Floor 25
-----------
There's one more floor we have
to clear! Four Phantoms will
appear, one of each type. Have
Zelda possess a Phantom
(Preferably the Torch Phantom)
to eliminate a Phantom here that
we have to worry about. Move to
the south, have Zelda light the
two torches here, and the door
to the Warp and Normal Phantoms
will open. A Phantom Eye will
also appear. Hurry to a safe
zone, and get Zelda to talk to
the Normal Phantom on either
side. Once the coast is clear,
head over there, strike the Warp
Phantom's back, and have Zelda
switch bodies. Again, rush Link
to the west safe zone.

Once you can, get spotted by the
Phantom Eye, then head to the
area beyond the sand pit to the
west. Cross it, then have Zelda
warp to you. Get Zelda to stand
on one switch, then Link to
stand on the other. This will
make the door behind the Normal
Phantom open. Now, find the
Wrecker Phantom, strike its
back, and switch Zelda to that.
Move her so that she gets behind
the Normal Phantom and wrecks
the statues there. To get Link
over there, move Link close by,
then have Zelda run over both
the Normal and Warp Phantoms.
While they're stunned, rush Link
to that safe zone behind the
Normal Phantom. Get Zelda back
there too, then have both push
the big door open. Head north.

Floor 24
-----------
Phew, we finally made it. Walk
north and open the chest to
get...the Compass of Light! Yay!
Your Forest rail map will glow,
revealing Spirit Tracks leading
to a portal to the Dark Realm.
Wow, it's surprisingly close to
Aboda, your home village. That's
a bit creepy... A blue light
portal will appear, so take it
to warp back to the base of the
Tower.

Before we head off to face Cole
and Malladus for the final
battle, let's clean up, get the
sidequests done with and upgrade
Link to his fullest. Talk to
Zelda once you're up to the
train, then go to the Forest
Realm. Take a stop at Castle
Town.


Castle Town
----------------
Check out Take 'Em All On to
find out that level 3 of the
place has opened up! Take a spin
through there if you'd like, you
get rare Treasure for winning.
Here's what to expect on each
floor.

Floor 1: 4 Blue ChuChus, 4
Helmet ChuChus here. Use Bombs
on the Blues. Floor 2: 16 Green
Spinuts. Icy floor here too!
Floor 3: 6 Stalfos Floor 4: 7
Fire Keese, 6 Ice Keese Floor 5:
3 Big Blins Floor 6: 6 Stalfos
Warriors Floor 7: 5 Gerunes
Floor 8: 5 Ergtoroks Floor 9: 4
Heatoises Floor 10: 12
Freezards. Use Light Arrows!
Floor 11: Stagnox, Armored
Colossus (BOSS) Floor 12: Fraaz,
Master of Icy Fire (BOSS) Floor
13: Phytops, Barbed Menace
(BOSS) Floor 14: Cragma, Lava
Lord (BOSS) Floor 15:
Skeldritch, Ancient Demon (BOSS)
Floor 16: Dark Link (BOSS)

-----------
BOSS: Dark Link ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well this is certainly a
surprise. You face your dark
replica here. Make sure you
break the pots before the battle
to heal up. Dark Link uses the
Bow, Bombs, sword slashes, sword
spin, and a fancy jumping slash.
It always blocks your attacks
unless you slash it when its
guard is down, like when it's
holding a Bomb, firing Arrows,
or landing from a jump slash.
For a final battle in this
minigame, it's actually pretty
easy to dodge the attacks. The
only challenge comes in striking
Dark Link when it's open. Once
it's taken enough hits, it'll
use a Great Spin, where it spins
around fast with sword extended.
-----------

So yeah, you get a rare Treasure
for beating this. Doesn't really
seem like much, but hey,
encountering a new boss is
reward enough! At least for me.
For getting other rare
treasures, you can try the guard
captain's training game. Every
time you beat your high score,
you get a piece of Treasure. For
reaching 999, the castle guards
bow down to you when you pass
them. Kind of a nice little
touch. Teacher is at the train
station, he wants to go to
another place. Get him a safe
ride over there for some money,
then head on over to Aboda
Village...unless he wanted there
again in the first place.


Aboda Village
----------------
You may have something in the
mailbox. It should be a letter
from Niko, and a letter from
Ferrus. Niko's letter just
basically tells you that he
can't wait to see you again, but
also includes a map of this
village, with X marks beneath
two trees. Ferrus's letter tells
you that he's in the Snow Realm
(judging by the picture he
sent), trying to catch some
"killer pics" of the Armored
Train. We'll get to him in a
minute. For now, mark the X
spots on Niko's map on your map,
then get next to the trees and
play the Song of Discovery by
each. Both contain pieces of
Treasure. Now visit Niko. For
having 15 stamps, he'll reward
you by allowing you to switch
between the Recruit Uniform and
Engineer's Clothes! Just talk to
him if you ever want to switch.

Now there's one last thing here.
There's a guy over by a pen who
wants to raise some Cuccos, and
he'd like 10 of them. Sure
thing! Ride over to Castle Town,
go to the Cucco pen, and
purchase 5 Cuccos for 50 Rupees.
They'll be put on your freight
car. Now just take them back
over to Aboda Village, being
careful not to get hit or let
Bulblins try to snatch your
Cuccos. Once you've arrived with
5 Cuccos and talked to the guy,
you'll have to ride back,
purchase 5 more (you can only
hold 5 of them in your freight
car), then ride them to Aboda
safely. In exchange for your
hefty work, you get a Force Gem!
This opens up Spirit Tracks just
west of here, on the path
leading to the Dark Realm. It's
a cave shortcut to the northwest
side of the Forest Realm, as
well as holding a warpgate!

Delivering Iron
----------------
Take off to Whittleton next.
You'll find that the residents
there need some steel to forge
into new axes. Didn't we see
steel a while ago? Yeah, it was
in Goron Village, on the
mountainpath. To head over
there, though, we can take a
warp. That warpgate we just
opened some Tracks to takes us
right to the Fire Realm. Just be
prepared to stop once you enter
the cave from the forest, as you
will need to activate the
warpgate first. Once you get to
the Fire Realm, make your way to
Goron Village. Once stopped
there, go west to the next area,
talk to the Goron to purchase
some iron for 100 Rupees. Now
warp your train back, and take
it slow as you head back to
Whittleton, as if you take the
left turn at the fork after the
warpgate, you'll have to deal
with three Orange Skulltulas
right after another. Once you
deliver the iron and speak to
the right person (the guy beside
the stack of lumber), you'll get
a Force Gem! This opens up
Spirit Tracks between the Forest
Temple and Rabbitland Rescue.

Carrying Fish
----------------
Now head to Castle Town. There's
a person here who wants some
fish, 10 to be exact. Ride over
to Papuchia Village at the Ocean
Realm. There's a woman by the
shop who sells fish! She happens
to want some ice for her fish,
but decline for now. Buy 20 fish
for 50 Rupees (can only buy in
increments of 20), then safely
transport them to Castle Town.
In other words, don't keep them
in the sun for too long, and
sound your whistle to scare any
birds away so they don't pick up
any of the fish. You'll get a
Force Gem for helping this
person out! This opens up Spirit
Tracks south of here, making a
new path to the Ocean Realm.
This also gets us to the last
grass rabbit, so take the Tracks
there and capture that bunny.
The tracks end at a dead-end in
the Ocean Realm, but there's an
ocean bunny there as well, so
capture that one too.

Building Fences
----------------
You may remember the Anouki in
Anouki Village who wants both
lumber and a carpenter to help
build it. Head to the Trading
Post to find the carpenter.
After some talk, the carpenter
decides to go with you. Now that
he's on your train, safely ride
to Whittleton. Purchase 20 logs
of lumber for 100 Rupees, then
get back on your train. Haul
both the carpenter and the
lumber to Anouki Village. It
helps to use the warpgate north
of Whittleton. Once there, talk
to the Anouki beside the
carpenter. He'll give you a
piece of Treasure for bringing
the carpenter, and a Force Gem
for the lumber! Yay! This Force
Gem opens up Spirit Tracks west
of the Snow Temple, supposedly
leading to a dead-end...

Transporting Ferrus
----------------
Remember that letter we got from
Ferrus? Yeah. Time to find him.
He should be around where the
Armored Train enemy is moving
around. If there aren't any
enemy trains on the tracks, then
just look around on the tracks
that are north of Anouki Village
and the Snow Sanctuary. Stop in
front of him when you find him.
He says he's looking for the
Armored Train, but then says
that he's a big fan of Alfonzo,
and wouldn't mind if you took
him to Aboda Village to see him.
Go ahead and agree. Take a safe
trip over there (warpgates are
helpful), following the driving
rules. Once at Aboda, go and
speak with Alfonzo and you will
get a Force Gem! This opens up
Spirit Tracks west of Castle
Town, leading to another way to
the Snow Realm.

Lokomo Vessel
----------------
Take a stop at the Snow
Sanctuary, and you'll find Steem
the Lokomo waiting for you right
at the station. Talk to him...he
says he wants a really fancy
vessel to help redecorate his
domain. Agree to do it, then
head off. We need to head to
Papuchia Village. Speak with the
Wise One, the clairvoyant.
Whether you take your fortune or
decline, she may ask if someone
in your life is feeling unlucky.
Say yes, and she will give you
one of the village's precious
vessels, normally 10,000 Rupees,
a mere 50 Rupees. By all means,
take it.

Now, this vessel is extremely
fragile. If you get hit even
once while on the train, it'll
crack, making it useless. It may
be best to just save here in
case you mess up. Take the
vessel safely back to Steem, and
you will get a Force Gem! This
will open up Spirit Tracks east
of the Snow Temple, seemingly
stopping at a dead-end...

Tracks that showed up. First,
the one west of the Snow Temple.
As you're heading north that
way, catch the rabbit here. At
the end is a new station! Stop
here.

Snowdrift Station
----------------
Well, we've reached a new
station. This is actually an
optional dungeon. We're gonna
have some fun here. Navigate
your way through all the
fencing, killing or dodging
White Wolfos, and enter the
actual dungeon. Once you enter,
read the stone tablet. It reads,
"Those who get the order wrong
will fall into darkness." Order?
Oh yeah, there's five switches
to the north that you can reach
with the Boomerang once you step
onto the perch here. Anyway, I
guess we have to explore this
dungeon to find the correct
order. There are four staircases
around here. Let's take them on
clockwise, starting with the
southwest staircase.

Once in this room, step on the
ground switch to open a door.
Rush along the winding river of
ice, rolling after you make a
turn to take them faster, then
pass through the door before it
closes. If you don't make it.
there's some stairs by the door
that takes you back to the
switch. Once past the door, read
the stone tablet. It reads, "The
first and the last are on the
ends." Well, keep that in mind.
Take the stairs, go south, and
exit this small room back to the
main one. Take the northwest
staircase next, being cautious
of the Freezards.

In this room, you'll have to
deal with a block pushing puzzle
to get the block to the body of
water to the east. This is the
quickest solution: north, east,
south, west, south, east, north,
then east. Now that the block is
in the water, hop on it, using
the Whirlwind to move along it.
Kill the Octives here (best way
is to just use Arrows) while
moving yourself east. After each
Whirlwind blow, make sure to
face north with your shield up
to block the arrow directors. At
the other side is another stone
tablet. This one reads, "The
second one and fourth one are
next to each other." Head up the
stairs here and take the passage
back west. Head out of this
room, then move to the northeast
staircase. You can kill
Freezards with Light Arrows,
just to let you know.

This room is dark, but it's
small, and it's lit fairly
decently with the icy torches,
so there's no need for a map.
Head west until you see an unlit
torch. Stop there, as it's in
water. Light it, then create a
sheet of ice on the water so you
can head west. Keep lighting
torches, creating an ice sheet
for you to move along the water,
and you'll eventually get to a
stone tablet. Thus it reads,
"Don't hit the false one in the
middle." Take the stairs up, and
go east and south back to the
exit. Now go down the final
staircase, the southeastern one.

Head east, then north. You'll
get locked into a watery room
with icy torches, Ice Keese, and
Octives. After they're killed,
you'll be allowed entry to the
north. The final stone tablet
has written on it, "The second
switch from the left is the
third switch to hit." Backtrack
to exit this room.

Having gotten all the clues, get
back to the perch south of the
switches. Look over the clues,
and you should have your answer.
From the left, the switches are
in this order that you have to
hit: 1, 4, *skip*, 2, 5. So
trace a careful Boomerang path
to hit them in that order. A
bridge will extend. Head north
to face Freezards! If you have
enough ammo, you can use Light
Arrows to kill them. Otherwise,
slash them and hide in a corner
facing towards the center to
block the Freezards when they
fly at you. Keep slashing them
when you can until they are
dead. As a reward for clearing
this dungeon, your treasure
awaits in a chest. Open it...and
you'll get an Alchemy Stone!
This is super-rare Treasure,
like the Regal Ring. It can be
sold for 2,500 Rupees, but I
actually suggest saving it if
you want to work on getting the
coveted Golden Train Part set
from Linebeck III.

Head back to your train, we're
gonna check out the other Tracks
that lead to a dead-end that we
opened up. There's another new
station here! Stop here.


Slippery Station
----------------
Interesting...head north,
killing Ice ChuChus, then enter.
This is yet another optional
sub-dungeon! However, this sub-
dungeon is a virtual skating
rink. Read the stone tablet to
the right to learn about it.
Basically, we have to pick a
course, step on the switch, then
gun it to the treasure. Start
with the Amateur course first,
then make your way up the higher
ranks, getting even better
prizes. Just some tips, roll
whenever you turn, as this will
speed up your turning. It
especially helps to roll at the
solid ground spots as you get
back on the ice. Doing so will
help you boost forward at
tremendous speeds. Now for the
prizes.

Amateur Course: Big Gold Rupee
(worth 300 Rupees) Pro Course:
Rare Treasure Champion Course:
Alchemy Stone

Phew! That's it for that. Get
all the treasures and leave back
to your train. We're gonna head
to the Fire Realm next.


Fire to Snow
----------------
Stop at Goron Village. There's a
Goron here who will call you. He
wants to take a ride to see what
Anouki Village is like. Board
him on, then take him to Anouki
Village safely. He'll give you a
Force Gem! This opens up Spirit
Tracks connecting Wellspring
Station to the gaggle of tracks
southeast of the Snow Temple.
The last two Snow Rabbits and a
warpgate are made available
here! Now, we can get another
Force Gem right off the bat.
Head to Honcho's house, where
the Goron is. This Anouki posing
as Honcho wants to go to Goron
Village since the Goron has been
talking about it. Take the
Anouki safely back to Goron
Village to get another Force
Gem! This opens up Spirit Tracks
east of Wellspring Station,
making another trail to the Fire
Realm.

Now that both Force Gems have
been acquired, make your way
towards Wellspring Station, but
pass it, and head north, taking
those new Spirit Tracks from
Force Gem #13. The last two Snow
Rabbits are first on your left,
then on your right. Activate the
new warpgate here after they're
captured, and let it warp you to
the Fire Realm. Now, we're going
to find the majority of rabbits
here in the Fire Realm before we
move on. Here's a map as always.

That's a lot of them, almost 10!
Once you capture them, make a
stop at the Goron Target Range.

Goron Target Range
----------------
Talk to the small Goron here and
pay 20 Rupees to play. We have
to ride along a set path with
our train, and shoot targets.
There are three kinds of targets
set on point values. The blue
ones give you ten points, the
red ones take three shots to
destroy, but each shot gives you
30 points, and the Goron target
takes away 30 points. Basically,
just make your way to the end,
getting as many points as
possible. At the end, you choose
your treasure. If you reach 1000
points as a record, you can play
again with an extended track to
get even more points. Basically,
the more points you get, the
better Treasure you'll get.
That's basically all this place
is for, is getting Treasure.
When you've had your fun, exit.


Helping Gorons
----------------
If you head to Goron Village,
you'll notice that there are
still some lava geysers around.
Go back to Wellspring Station
and ask for some Mega Ice, then
carry it to Goron Village. Once
there, if you have at least 10
Mega Ice pieces, then talk to
the Goron by the lava geysers
and it will be used to clear
them away. You'll get a Force
Gem! Spirit Tracks leading to
the Sand Realm will appear.
There's also a warpgate along
there. We'll be using that
shortly. Head towards the
elder's house. There's a Goron
kid there who wants to see
Castle Town! Take him safely
over there, and follow the Goron
kid wherever he goes.
Eventually, you'll get a Force
Gem from him. This opens up
Spirit Tracks leading from the
Fire Realm's west side to the
myriad of Tracks surrounding the
Fire Temple. A new station is
available there, as well as a
Mountain Rabbit.

Ferrus Trouble
----------------
While you're here, check the
mailbox, as you may have
something there. It's a letter
from Ferrus. Read it, and he
says that he's lost! He's
somewhere in the Fire Realm.
Well, let's head over there.
Best way to do so is to start
off from Goron Village west, and
go north as soon as you can.
Keep going north when you can
and you'll find him. After
talking to him, you'll find out
he wants to go to the Ocean
Temple. Yeah...let's go. Best
way to do this is to go down the
Spirit Tracks just east of the
Tower of Spirits. There's a
warpgate here which gets us
pretty close to the underwater
transporter in the Ocean Realm.
For safely taking Ferrus to the
Ocean Temple, you get a Force
Gem, which connects the myriad
of the Fire Temple Tracks to the
Sand Realm tracks to the south.
Awesome sauce.

before stopping.

Disorientation Station
----------------
Quite a mouthful of a name.
Zelda spots a Hyrule Castle
guard way up top. I wonder why
he's here...find a bird around
here, call it with the Song of
Birds, and hitch a ride using
your Whip. Get off on the high
west platform and open the chest
for a piece of Treasure. Get
back on the bird, then drop at
the high east platform. Swing
across, then start climbing. At
the west side, open the chest
for a Red Rupee. Approach the
guard there, and he says that he
and his friend were searching
for a golden treasure (wonder
what that could be...) when they
got attacked by a giant plant
monster. He escaped, leaving his
friend behind. He hopes his
friend is safe down there, but
is too scared to go back down
there. Since the cave is a maze,
take heed of his tips:

"From a room that knows no
south, follow the rocky trail
north and north... There in the
north lies the treasure, waiting
to be discovered." Before
heading down there, head east,
open up the chest for a Big
Green Rupee, then head back and
enter. Now, this is a bit of a
maze in that every room looks
the same. Just head north and
east, kill the Fire Babas, then
play the Song of Discovery by
the stone tile. Open the chest
for an Alchemy Stone! This is
the treasure they were looking
for. Head south, and you'll find
a stone tablet. Read what it
says...it's the guard's friend's
last words. How sad...head west
and exit. Talk to the guard,
tell him "Well..." and he will
give you a Big Green Rupee for
relieving his worry. Though his
friend may be dead, the fact
that he wasn't angry relieves
him. Let's leave him be for now
and get back to our train.


Cool Your Fish
----------------
Remember back when you were
getting fish for that woman in
Castle Town? The person who was
selling fish at Papuchia Village
wanted some Mega Ice to keep the
fish cool. Head to Wellspring
Station, buy some Mega Ice, then
head over to Papuchia Village.
The quickest way over there is
to head west from Wellspring,
immediately south, east, and
skip the two turns. Go through
the warpgate there to
appear...almost close to
Papuchia Village. Still much
better than traversing the
Forest Realm though. Once you
get to Papuchia, talk to the
woman and you will get a Force
Gem, opening up Spirit Tracks
connecting those stray Tracks
from the Forest Realm. This also
opens up a new station.

Check the mailbox and you may
have yet another letter from
Ferrus. He says he found
something neat at the Ocean
Temple, and says he'll give it
to you if you find him. A
picture of where he may be found
is there. Let's see...it's in a
forest, there's a whistle sign
nearby, and it looks like
there's a fork in the tracks.
The biggest clue however, is the
fact that the rails of the
tracks are blue. Blue rails
means they are tracks that
connect the Tower of Spirits to
a temple. So, best way to find
him is to start by the Tower of
Spirits and follow the blue
tracks to him. He gives you what
he found: a rare Treasure! Thank
him, and we'll be on our way.
This time, take the new tracks
on the west side of the Ocean
Realm, making a stop at the new
station.


Pirate Hideout
----------------
Head east, looking at the high
ledges, and you'll spot the
stamp station for this area up
there! How do we reach it? Use
the Song of Birds to call a bird
over. Hitch a ride to it, and
get your stamp! Jump off, and
enter the cave.

Uh oh, there's someone trapped
in here. We can't reach him, but
we have to defend him from
Miniblins using our Bow. We have
an unlimited supply of Arrows,
so don't worry about running
out. Next part, we have to take
the person along with us in a
cart, while sniping down more
Miniblins. At the end, you'll
have to face a Big Blin as you
slowly approach it. Use Arrows
once more to take down the Big
Blin. If you take him safely out
of there, congrats...but it's
not over yet. We still have to
give him a safe ride to Papuchia
Village. Just be wary of those
Pirate Ships, they may try to
board your train to take back
the passenger if you take too
long in destroying them. For
taking him successfully to the
village, he gives you a Force
Gem! This opens up a line of
Spirit Tracks connecting the
Pirate Hideout to the underwater
transporter. A warpgate and
Ocean Rabbit are available on
this path!

Now make a return trip to Pirate
Hideout, and you'll find a Goron
kid. Talk to him to find out his
friend has been captured. Head
on in there and play the game
again. This time, we're looking
to get as many points as
possible. You get more points by
not missing a single shot with
your Arrows. Think of it as a
"combo point system". By beating
the 3000 point "record", you get
an upgrade for your Quiver,
allowing you to carry more
Arrows! Try again and get over
4000 points. By doing so, you
get yourself a Heart Container!
Subsequent attempts gives you
treasure of varying rarity
depending on the points you get.

Oh! Rael is here. He says he
wants some Cuccos, as he has
heard that when they are
threatened, they summon an
incredible power to defend
themselves (Ha!). He wants to
use this power for the good of
mankind. So...he wants 5 Cuccos.
Purchase some at Castle Town,
then take them safely to the
Sand Sanctuary. As thanks,
you'll get a Force Gem! This
opens up some Spirit Tracks in
the northeast corner, apparently
leading to a dead-end. You can
actually keep giving Rael more
and more Cuccos for 150 Rupee
treasures. However, that's not
really important. What IS
important is that, with Cuccos
here, we can reach the final
Stamp Station! Grab a Cucco and
jump towards the islands here.
The farthest island has this
final stamp. Now that we have
that stamp, you can head over to
Niko's at Aboda Village. As a
reward for getting all the
Stamps, he gives you Swordsman's
Scroll 2, which allows you to do
the Great Spin Attack. Simply do
a spin attack three times in
quick succession to perform
this. While spinning, you can
move around freely.

Dark Ore Delivery
----------------
Now...we're gonna work on
getting the last Force Gem. It's
also possibly the hardest one to
get as well. Linebeck III wants
some precious Dark Ore. What he
wants it for, we'll never
know...but he wants it. It melts
in the sunlight, but is harder
than steel when in caves. Five
blocks of Dark Ore will do. So,
where to find Dark Ore? The
Spirit Tracks on the east side
of the Fire Realm leading down
to the Sand Realm is the spot to
look for. Stop at the station
once you find it. (Best to use
the warpgate near Aboda, in the
forest and caves)

Once here, enter any cave and
talk to a Goron. Purchase 10
blocks of Dark Ore for 200
Rupees. That's really pricy...
Before heading out, it's a good
idea to save...just in case you
mess up, you know. Get on your
train, and follow the tracks
leading south. Prepare for
trouble...you'll have to face a
Rocktite boss again! This is the
toughest one so far, and you
must be careful to not get hit
at all. This one also has some
Tektite buddies to give you
extra trouble. If you have at
least 9 blocks of Dark Ore when
you finish it, you're good.

You've gone through the worst of
it, to be honest. Head south to
the Ocean Realm part of the
desert. When you get there, take
a left and use the warp. After
that, go west, then south, skip
the first turn, go east, and use
the warp. You'll be right near
the Trading Post, so get over
there. If you have at least 5
blocks of Dark Ore left, then
great! Go see Linebeck III and
he will give you the final Force
Gem. This opens up Spirit Tracks
surrounding the island in the
southeast side of the Ocean
Realm. The last Ocean Rabbit is
there, along with a new
station...wonder what's up
there.

Before you leave, you might have
a letter in the mailbox. It's
from Kagoron. He says there's
some neat treasure we can get at
Dark Ore Mine. Included with the
letter is a map he drew as a
kid. Well, let's head back to
Dark Ore Mine. Take the center
entrance to the mine, and look
at the map. Doesn't that look
similar to Kagoron's map? So
head to the northeast section of
the mine, and play the Song of
Discovery to uncover a treasure
chest. Open it to get a rare
Treasure! Head back to your
train and follow the tracks up
to the north that lead to a
dead-end. Capture the last
Mountain Rabbit along that path,
then stop at the new station.

(I just found out that you can
do the Rocktite boss before
carrying the Dark Ore to make it
easier on you. So yeah. >_>)

Ends of the Earth Station
----------------
There's three cave entrances
here. Each cave holds a block
pushing puzzle. The middle one
is the easiest, so head on
through. These are probably the
hardest puzzles around, but you
probably want the solutions,
huh?

Brainteaser
-----------
Well, the first puzzle you get
to, you have to push a block
onto the blue tile, with its
pronged blue side down. Here's
the best solution: east, east,
south, south, west, north, and
west. You must use the Sand Wand
on these. Head on to the next
puzzle. This one is actually
pretty easy, the same puzzle,
but some fences to block
movement. The solution is: east,
east, east, south, south, south,
west. Now for the final puzzle.
This last puzzle gives you a
very limited space to do this,
so it's harder. The solution is:
south, east, north, west, west,
south, east, north, east, south,
west. Head on through the door
that opens, and open the chest
for a rare piece of Treasure.
Follow the hall, cross the
bridge, and open the other chest
for a Big Green Rupee. Awesome!

Puzzle 2: South Block: north,

 south).

Puzzle 3: Right Block: south,

and east), north (push the
 right block south), east, north
Left Block: east, south, east,
north, west, north, west. Center
Block (assuming it's in the
southeast corner): north, west,
south, west,
 north, east, south

For solving them all, head
forward and open the chest for a
Heart Container! Follow the
hall, cross the bridge, and open
the other chest for another Big
Green Rupee!

back on your train. We're gonna
explore one more location before
we get to finding the remaining
rabbits in the game. And this
place is...the southeast side of
the Ocean Realm, the tracks
surrounding that island. There's
an Ocean Rabbit there to the
west of the station. Capture it,
then stop at the new station.

Lost at Sea Station
----------------
Hm...there's a very tall
platform here, and two
inactivated crystals. Play the
Song of Light near both,
activating them and creating
beams of light. Go to where they
intersect and play the Song of
Discovery to uncover a chest.
Open it for a rare Treasure! Now
play the Song of Birds and hitch
a ride using your Whip, so you
can reach the top. Kill the
Crows up here, and find the
light crystal. Play the Song of
Light near it and it will shine
a beam towards a spot in the
north wall. Blast that part of
the wall with a Bomb and head
inside. There are some pots and
nuts here to refill your stuff.
Play the Song of Awakening near
the Gossip Stone to awaken it.
It says. "This temple is a
replica of a legendary temple in
a distant kingdom. Many
treasures are hidden within. And
to protect these treasures are
many Phantoms. If you wish to
enter, you cannot use your sword
or your bow. Do you wish to
proceed?" Pick yes, and we will
enter.

Floor 1
-----------
This is supposed to be the
Temple of the Ocean King from
Phantom Hourglass! Wow.
Obviously things are changed
around, such as the environment,
but the music and some floors
are the same. Anyway, two
Phantoms show up here. One
guards the outer halls, another
guards the inner halls. The
stone tablet by us tells us to
light all the torches. Head to
the west safe zone and open the
chest for a common Treasure.
Head to the center when it's
safe to find a lit torch and an
unlit torch. Use your Boomerang
to light the unlit one. There's
unlit torches in the northern
corners as well. Use the lit
torches by the staircase as a
fire source. This will open up
the staircase. Head downstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Bah, a dark floor. Two Torch
Phantoms appear here, and the
stone tablet says to put out all
the lights. I'll provide a map,
with locations of said torches.

--------------------------------

First of all, that little alcove
jutting out on the east side
looks suspicious. Get over there
and tap around to open a chest.
Inside is a 150 Rupee Treasure.
Now blow out all the torches
here with the Whirlwind and the
door to downstairs will open. Go
downstairs.

Floor 3
-----------
Two Warp Phantoms and a Phantom
Eye will appear on this floor.
Looks like we'll have to be
careful. The stone tablet says
that one switch is correct in
each pair. Well, there are four
pairs of two fish heads, in each
of the four corners of this
floor. Pulling the wrong one of
any of them using the Whip
causes more Phantom Eyes to
appear, and we don't want that.
First, go to the northeast
corner and open the chest for a
150 Rupee Treasure, to get that
out of the way. Now, since we're
over here, pull the right fish
head. Go to the northwest corner
and pull the left one. Go to the
southwest and pull the right
one, then go to the southeast
and pull the right one. This
opens a door to downstairs, so
take it.

Floor 4
-----------
Four Wrecker Phantoms appear
down here. The stone tablet
tells you to smash all the rocks
on this floor. Well, that seems
pretty self-explanatory. First
up though is the treasure on
this floor. There's two of them
this time, one in the southwest
corner and one in the northeast
corner. Open them both for
pieces of Treasure. Now just
Bomb all the rocks and the way
upward will open. Head
downstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
There's one of every Phantom
here. The stone tablet tells you
to open all the treasure chests.
Head to the northeast side, as
it seems the easiest. Open the
chest for some Treasure, then
pull the left fish head to lower
the spikes to the northwest
chest. Head over there and open
the chest for some Treasure.
Now, on the north side of the
floor are two torches, one of
them unlit. Light that one and
the southwest side will have its
spikes lowered. Get over there
and open the chest for some
Treasure. Last is the chest in
the southeast corner. You could
bring the Wrecker Phantom over
there and destroy the rocks, but
that would be WAY too risky.
Instead, just use Bombs. It'll
take a while, since the Phantom
will hear the noise almost every
time, but it's the safest
option. Open the chest for some
Treasure, and the door to the
north will open. Head through,
and open the chest for a Regal
Ring! Exit through the blue
light portal.

Ah...so good to be back with our
sword and bow. Go ahead and
refill again before you leave.
You can also keep doing this
sub-dungeon over and over to
keep getting Treasure: true to
Phantom Hourglass's Temple of
the Ocean King, treasure chests
are reset whenever you leave.
Yes, this even means you can get
the Regal Ring again. This
provides an endless repertoire
of Regal Rings, if you ever are
strapped for money. Now we need
to get the last remaining
rabbits. The last 10 rabbits are
in the Sand Realm, and said
Realm shares both the Ocean and
Fire Realms. I'm gonna provide a
map as usual, but it'll be a
little different.

--------------------------------

If you forgot how to get through
the twisted tunnels, scroll back
up to the Sands of Light section
of this walkthrough. Once you
have all 50 rabbits in the game,
visit Rabbitland Rescue in the
Forest Realm. You'll get a bunch
of prizes, but most of all, you
get Swordsman's Scroll 1! Now
with this handy, your sword can
shoot out beams when you're at
full health! Imagine that...

Now, there's a hidden treasure
chest that we can get while
we're here in Rabbitland Rescue.
See that tiny island in the
middle? Well, get up on the
mountain area with all the red
rabbits you rescued, then take a
leap of faith towards the
island. If you made it, open the
chest for a piece of Treasure! A
bridge extends so you can get
out of here. Now, get back on
your train. If you have at least
2,000 Rupees (you should have a
lot more than that if you
haven't been buying much), then
head to the Snow Sanctuary.
There's an Anouki shop here that
sells a very important item: a
Heart Container. It's available
for said 2,000 Rupees, so
purchase it. Where's the last
Heart Container? Well, it's the
reward for getting to Gold
Membership at Beedle's Air Shop,
so you'll have to spend, spend,
spend! Finally, there's a Quiver
upgrade available at the shop in
Goron Village for 2,000 Rupees.
Wow. You may need to sell some
Treasure if you aren't looking
to get any train parts for now.

Now, for the last thing to do.
We skipped some treasures
between Floor 1 and 10 of the
Tower of Spirits, and now that
we have every item, we can
access them. So, drive back to
the Tower of Spirits...


Tower of Spirits
----------------
Head up the spiral staircase and
enter the first door you see to
get onto the first floor.

Floor 1
-----------
Head up to the west side and you
will see a gap. Use the
Boomerang to hit the switch in
the far corner. This makes a
chest appear by the north Tear
of Light. Go over and open it
for a rare Treasure. Head
upstairs.

Floor 2
-----------
Follow the path to where the
Phantom is stationed, make some
noise so he'll investigate, then
stab him in the back, letting
Zelda take over. Now approach
the northwest corner to see a
crack in the wall. Blast it open
with a Bomb, then head through.
Open the chest for a rare
Treasure, then exit. Now take
both of you to the northeast
side, facing the gap. Have Zelda
face the gap, then get behind
her and use the Whirlwind to
blow her across. Get her to step
on the floor switch to extend a
bridge for Link. Cross it, open
the chest for a rare Treasure,
then have Zelda walk off the
edge to the left so that Link
can hop on. Move south and east
to the little room, and get off
on the chest's ledge. Open it
for yet another rare Treasure.

Head upstairs, warp back to the
train, then continue up the
spiral staircase again. Enter
the second door you come to.

Floor 4
-----------
Not anything you can do here, so
have Zelda possess a Phantom,
then cross the south lava pit
with both of them, then head
upstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
Cross the lava pit to the north
end, follow the hall west, then
go north when you can. Hop on
Zelda, then move her onto the
raised platform. Use the
Boomerang to hit the switch on
the raised floor around the
corner to open the door to the
east. Head through, but don't go
upstairs. Just pass the next pit
of lava. Now, have Zelda move
along the top narrow path here
so that she acts as a shield to
protect you from the
flamethrowers. Obviously you
must follow so that you're
"behind" her on the south path.

On the other side is a cracked
wall. Bomb it and head inside.
Open the chest for the rare
treasures, then exit. Head south
along the hall, then go
downstairs.

Floor 4
-----------
NOW we can do something here.
Blow Zelda across the pit with
the Whirlwind, then have her
step on the floor switch to
light one of the two torches.
Have Link light the other one,
and a bridge will extend for
Link. Now, give Zelda a Bomb by
throwing it at her, then have
her cross the fires over to the
blocks. She'll place the Bomb if
you drew a path into a rock,
creating a crosshairs. Now that
it's open, have her step on the
floor switch to lower the fires
for Link. Get to Zelda and open
the chest for a rare Treasure.
Head back upstairs.

Floor 5
-----------
Go upstairs from the small lava
pit you crossed earlier ago.

Floor 6
-----------
You'll have to face two
Geozards. Snatch their shields
then have Link and Zelda take on
both of them. After they're
gone, go through the south door
that opens for a myriad of
treasure chests! Open them all
for some Treasures. Return
downstairs.

Floor 5/6/7
-----------
Go upstairs from the northwest
corner. Follow the floors until
you reach the end. Warp back to
the train, then go up the spiral
staircase once more, heading in
through the third door you see.

Floor 8
-----------
This is the last floor where we
missed treasure, so we're nearly
done. Head east, then south,
then east again to the
southernmost hall. Somewhere on
the north wall is a weak section
that can be bombed. To find it
easily, clank your sword around
until you hear a different
noise. Place the Bomb there,
blast it away, then head in.
Open the chest for a rare
Treasure, then just head back to
where you entered the floor,
back in the spiral staircase.
Just take the elevator in front
of you to return to the train.
Exit to the Forest Realm.

Only one thing left to
do...drive over to the Dark
Realm. Whenever you're ready, do
so. You'll gain sight of the
place as soon as you emerge from
the tunnels. Man, this place is
huge...keep following the tracks
to the black portal...


Dark Realm
----------------
This is the Dark Realm, and
there's a series of Spirit
Tracks strewn around this place,
with six Armored Trains
patrolling around. Also
scattered around the Tracks are
Tears of Light--when you drive
over one, a wave of light
surrounds your train for about
20 seconds, making you
invulnerable. While in this
state, you can blow the whistle
to go super fast. You must go
and destroy the Armored Trains
with the Tears of Light, but
don't worry, they respawn. The
more Armored Trains you destroy,
the faster your train will be in
general.

The northeast section of the
Tracks has two Armored Trains
and one Tear of Light. To take
them easily, watch their patrol
area, and wait just beyond that
patrol area (south side is
good), as they can't get past
it. When both of them are to the
north, quickly head to the Tear
of Light, as they'll turn around
to try to get you. Once you grab
the Tear, reverse and ram into
both Trains (or at least one).
To reach the Armored Train in
the northwest side, you have to
take the middle portal to the
east. You'll appear on a
secluded piece of Track with a
single Tear. You have to use
this Tear as you appear where
the Armored Train is and destroy
it before the Tear's power runs
out.

After defeating them, you will
encounter...

-----------
BOSS: Demon Train
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Yes, a battle
between two trains, and
obviously the Demon Train is a
lot bigger than you. It takes
place on four Tracks, and the
Demon Train always takes up two.
Dark fires may sometimes be on
the track, so you'll have to be
vigilant and switch Tracks when
necessary. The objective is to
destroy each section of the
Demon Train before it escapes,
and it's obviously done in
phases.

The first phase has you dealing
with the cargo car. This
constantly drops exploding
barrels on your path, so you
have to destroy them. To
actually damage the car, you
have to shoot the barrels when
they're still in the process of
being launched. If the Demon
Train yells, then immediately go
reverse. You won't actually go
reverse, but you'll slow down
tremendously. When the Demon
Train yells, that means it's
going to switch Tracks in an
attempt to ram into you. Once
you dodge that, switch Tracks
yourself so you don't run into
it. After the cargo car is
destroyed, move on to phase two.

This time you'll have to deal
with laser cannons. Get even
with the Demon Train and shoot
the guns of the lasers to damage
them. Each laser gun requires
two shots to destroy. Again,
watch for dark fires on the
tracks and whenever the Demon
Train tries to change Tracks.
After the laser cannon car is
destroyed, phase three will come
into effect.

More lasers here, except there's
a LOT of them. There's not much
you can do as far as dodging
them goes (unless you want to be
cool), just hit the pegs that
fire lasers from the car. Once
you've destroyed them all, the
Demon Train will slow down and
get behind you. Fire at its face
until it decides to switch
Tracks. Get behind it quickly,
and try it once more. Once the
lasers are gone again and the
Demon Train gets behind you, it
will switch Tracks so that it's
actually behind you, and will
slowly catch up. You can't
escape it at this point, so just
shoot the face until the fight
is over.
-----------

Link and Zelda will prepare for
the final battle that awaits.
After some talk, engineer and
princess will agree that they
can make it without Anjean's or
Byrne's help, as both are still
rather injured. Anjean gives
Zelda a Phantom's armor so that
she may help. Before they go,
Zelda asks you what you want to
do when this is all over. The
after-credits scene changes
slightly depending on your
choice, just to let you know.
I'll give scene descriptions at
the end of this walkthrough. But
for now, it's boss time!

-----------
BOSS: Malladus ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
We're on top of the Demon Train,
and it has started moving,
leaving our train behind! We
need to head over to Malladus,
in Zelda's body, at the other
end of the train. However, Cole
is going to be rather irritating
here. As he knows Zelda's
"weakness", he'll constantly
spawn ghost rats to Zelda so
she'll get scared. If they're
not gone fast enough, they'll
shock her, and Cole will control
Zelda's Phantom body with ghost
strings. Use the Boomerang to
cut those strings if this
happens. Otherwise, trace a path
for Zelda towards Malladus,
while you keep Cole at bay.

You can keep him from summoning
ghost rats if you slash at him.
He'll disappear for a second,
giving you some time. When you
get close enough, Malladus will
attempt to fire a strong laser
at Link to push him back. Stay
behind Zelda to avoid this. Even
further, and parts of the Demon
Train will twist and sway,
making it difficult to get over
there. Once Zelda has reached
Malladus, she will grab ahold of
her body to pin him down. It's
not helping much, but at least
it's distracting Malladus and
Cole. Shoot a Light Arrow
straight at Malladus to end this
battle.
-----------

Watch the scene as the energy
from the Light Arrow starts to
weaken Malladus. Suddenly, the
Demon Train derails, throwing
everyone off... Link awakens
back at Hyrule, in the ruins of
the Dark Realm's temple, but
still apparently injured.
Zelda's spirit is still with
him. Suddenly, Malladus escapes
Zelda's body. Her spirit rushes
to try to join back into her
body...but it doesn't work. As
she keeps trying, Malladus
attempts to possess Zelda's body
again, but is stopped by a
magical force. It's Byrne! He's
giving Zelda a chance to focus
her power so she can safely join
her body.

It's a success! ...But she can't
float while she's living, so
Link gets up to try to catch
her...unsuccessfully. Zelda
wakes, sees she's in her body,
and hugs Link. I think she's
happy she's back in her body,
eh? Uh oh, Byrne is in
trouble...crap, he's dead! As
Cole tries to get Malladus to
get rid of Link and Zelda,
Malladus devours Cole,
possessing his body instead.
This mutates Malladus into a
giant, horned demon. Time for
battle!

-----------
FINAL BOSS: Malladus
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ For the
first phase of this battle,
Zelda will attempt to focus her
power so that we can have a
better chance of defeating
Malladus. During this, you have
to defend her from the fireballs
Malladus tries to fire at her.
Just use sword slashes. It's
simple at first, but quickly
gets harder with the more power
Zelda focuses. Eventually,
Malladus will attempt to fire
multiple fireballs at once. To
protect Zelda from them, just
get close to her and do a spin
attack at the right time to
deflect them all. You have
unlimited tries, so long as Link
is alive. After this phase is
done, time will stop briefly,
protecting Link and Zelda.

Second phase really doesn't have
to deal with Malladus at all. In
fact, to summon the full power
of the spirits and Lokomos to
help you win the battle, you
have to perform a sacred duet
with Zelda. The notes for you to
play are: Red, Purple, Yellow,
Light Blue, Red. Keep the tips
in mind, this is the hardest
thing to do with the Spirit
Flute! After having done it, the
Lokomos will join in the epic
duet, creating a beautiful song.
This starts the third phase of
the battle.

Malladus now has a weak spot
revealed on his back. Zelda
takes your Bow of Light and asks
you to distract Malladus so she
can fire at Malladus's back. You
can control both Link and Zelda
now. The top screen shows an
over-the-shoulder view of Zelda.
You have a new button on the
bottom screen. Tapping this
makes Zelda fire a Light Arrow.
Basically, get Link behind
Malladus and slash his arms and
legs to distract him. It doesn't
hurt him, only distract him.
Once Malladus has his back faced
to you, strafe Zelda around by
tracing a path for her so that
she can get a clear shot of
Malladus's back. When the
crosshairs on the top screen
turn yellow, you have a clear
shot! Fire that Light Arrow.

Fire two more successful shots,
and Malladus will collapse...but
it's not over yet. We need to
drive the Lokomo Sword through
Malladus's skull to kill him,
but we need to cut off his
horns. All you can do right now
is slash at one of the horns
until it's cut. Now that one
horn is cut, Malladus will be on
to your games. You can no longer
fire a Light Arrow just any time
you get a clear shot, as he'll
dodge it. Instead, you have to
distract him long enough until
he roars. Once he's roared,
immediately shoot a Light Arrow
at his back, assuming you have a
clear shot. Fire two more and
Malladus will collapse again.
Cut the other horn off.

He hasn't changed his pattern at
this point. Keep firing Light
Arrows at his back once you have
a clear shot and while he roars.
After just one Light Arrow,
he'll collapse again. He must be
getting weak. Slash the gem on
his head. Now you must rub the
stylus and keep the Lokomo Sword
in there as long as possible
while Zelda runs over to give
you a hand. Once she's there,
continue moving the stylus
rapidly, and the fight...will be
over. Malladus has been killed,
once and for all...
-----------

Watch the resulting ending
scene. Hyrule is safe, and the
Lokomos are no longer needed.
Byrne is revealed to be one of
the Lokomo, and will be reborn
years after. Anjean, Byrne's
spirit, and the rest of the
Lokomos ascend to the heavens as
Link and Zelda look to the
glistening, orange sunrise. As
the two take in the
surroundings...rolling
mountains, dense forests, the
graceful waves of the
ocean...Link extends a hand to
Zelda. The hand of a hero, and
the hand of a princess, join
together. Their relationship has
grown to far more than just
friends...

And so the credits appear! I
love that ending. It's probably
the best ending in a Zelda game
to date...tied with Ocarina of
Time's, of course. Enjoy the
sketches of after-game scenes,
such as Link returning Zelda to
Hyrule Castle, and Teacher being
relieved and shocked to see
Zelda back safely, to Niko
telling two children of Link's
brave adventure of restoring the
Spirit Tracks and killing
Malladus. After the credits,
you'll see another scene
afterwards. Here's the scene
depending on what you picked.

Engineer: Zelda is at her desk,
working papers and important
bills, when she hears a distant
train whistle. She rushes to her
window, and sees Link driving
by. She waves at him and
giggles, then the camera pans up
to the sky, showing "The End".
The train whistle goes off once
again.

Warrior: Zelda is at her desk,
working papers and important
bills, when she hears some
swords clanking. She rushes to
her window, and sees Link. She
yells and waves at Link, but it
distracts him so that he gets
hit. Zelda cringes a little bit,
then smiles, and half-heartedly
waves. The camera pans up to the
sky, showing "The End".

Dunno: Zelda is at her desk,
looking at a picture of her and
Link. She looks toward a window
for a moment, smiles, then
continues working on some
paperwork. The camera pans out,
through the window, and turns to
face the sky. "The End."

So that's that! I hope you
enjoyed the game or enjoyed
reading this guide. Catch you
next time, guys!

Following in Phantom Hourglass's
trail, Spirit Tracks retains
strictly collecting Heart
Containers to increase your
health, doing away with the
Piece of Heart system. As there
are only five dungeons in the
game (thus 5 Containers
collected from bosses), there's
a lot more Heart Containers
available through sidequests.
Starting with the three you
start with, and the five boss
Containers, there are eight
other Heart Containers to find,
bringing the total amount of
health to 16 Hearts. I'll only
list the eight with how to get
them and when, as the boss Heart
Containers are obvious. There
are checkmark boxes to keep
track of which ones you've
gotten if you decide to print
this out.

Sometime after clearing the
Forest Temple, you'll be advised
to stop at Castle Town and pick
up Alfonzo. Do so and take him
back to Aboda Village. While he
outfits your train with a cannon
to defend yourself with, visit
Niko and he will give you a
Stamp Book! With this, you must
find stamp stations all around
Hyrule and stamp onto the book
to mark places that you've been
to. There are 20 stamp stations
in all, and Niko will give you
secret prizes depending on how
many stamps you've placed in the
book once you visit him again.
The prizes are shown below. This
section also tells you where to
find the stamp stations. There
are checkmark boxes beside each,
like in other sections of this
guide, that you can use to mark
off what you've gotten.

Throughout the overworld, while
riding the train, you'll find
rabbits hiding behind rocks and
barrels and the like. Visit
Rabbitland Rescue at the
northwest side of the Forest
Realm and you will get the
Rabbit Net, which allows you to
catch rabbits. To catch them,
destroy whatever the rabbit is
hiding behind with your train's
cannon, then you'll go into a 10
second minigame. You must tap
the screen to swing down the
rabbit net to catch the rabbit
before it runs away. There are
50 in all, and if you return 5
rabbits back to Rabbitland
Rescue, you will get a Heart
Container, while if you return
all 50, you learn a sword
technique! This shows where you
can get the rabbits in the form
of maps, including the rewards
you get for finding all of each
kind. I do not recommend viewing
this unless you have all the
Force Gems, as these maps show
ALL the Spirit Tracks revealed
from Force Gems.

Quite an improvement over
Phantom Hourglass, this game has
tons of sidequests to do. Some
of them are just general favors,
others give you Force Gems when
the sidequests are completed,
which open up new Spirit Tracks
on the Trail Map. As such,
sidequests will be split up into
two categories here: general,
and ones that give Force Gems.

In the Forest Realm, there's a
place called the Trading Post.
Linebeck III owns the place, and
makes a living buying and
selling Treasures. You can sell
any Treasures you've gotten for
Rupees, or you can trade them in
for special Train Parts!
Depending on how many Train
Parts you've gotten in a set,
your train's stamina will
increase. The maximum is six
hearts for any train part set
completed, but there is a
legendary Gold part set, which
if you get them all, your
train's stamina will reach eight
hearts! Not bad. Keep in mind
that you have to have the parts
put on your train for the
stamina to change. To put on or
change train parts that you
have, head to Aboda Village and
talk to Alfonzo.

This section has three lists:
Parts listed by type, parts
listed by set, and the Treasure
you need to trade for each part.
There are checkmark boxes beside
each part in the Requirements
list which you can use to mark
off if you choose to print this

Skull: ¯¯¯¯¯ A highly
unconventional train design. The
primary color being red, it
catches the eye but feels
unnatural. The technology is
certainly far-fetched. Perhaps a
mad scientist with a fondness
for skulls built this. The
whistle is...rather strange, yet
provides the user with musical
creativity.

---------------
Skull Engine ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: Created by a
gearhead, it's unclear whether
it can even go
 underground.

Requirements:
4 Stalfos Skulls
3 Bee Larvae
2 Ruto Crowns

---------------
Skull Cannon ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: This cannon might
be brightly colored, but it
packs quite a punch.

Requirements:
2 Stalfos Skulls
3 Demon Fossils

Skull Passenger Car

whistles technology experts

 cram in.

Requirements:
3 Stalfos Skulls

---------------
Skull Freight Car
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Description:
It's not clear how this car
floats. Maybe there's a magic
carpet
 inside?

Requirements:
2 Stalfos Skulls
4 Wood Hearts
2 Pirate Necklaces

------------------------
Garden: ¯¯¯¯¯¯ A rather homely
train design, though it feels
moreso like a personal train fit
for a rather large garden. I
guess that's where the name
comes from. Fans of Epona may
love this design simply for the
sound of its whistle.

---------------
Stagecoach Engine
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Description:
This train is sure to get
people's attention.

Requirements:
1 Ancient Gold Piece
3 Dragon Scales
8 Bee Larvae

---------------
Tower Cannon ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

cannon resembles a soaring

While very pretty, this mobile
garden might not be the best for
 hauling.

Requirements:
1 Ancient Gold Piece
2 Pearl Necklaces
7 Stalfos Skulls

------------------------
Dragon: ¯¯¯¯¯¯ Straight from
China, this train makes you feel
like you're riding an actual
dragon! Complete with a moving
head for the engine! Your
enemies will think twice about
confronting you when they see
this scary monster! Now if only
the whistle was a dragon's roar
instead of a China gong...

---------------
Dragonhead Engine
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Description:
This train was created in the
far past and seems to harbor a
great
 spirit.

Requirements:
2 Pirate Necklaces
1 Mystic Jade
12 Demon Fossils

---------------
Dragon Cannon ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: It's hard to tell
which part of the dragon this
comes from. The
 chest?

Requirements:
2 Pirate Necklaces
1 Goron Amber
9 Wood Hearts

---------------
Dragon Passenger Car
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: The strange design
of this carriage is appealing,
but would you
 ride in it?

Requirements:
1 Pirate Necklace
3 Dark Pearl Loops
8 Demon Fossils

---------------
Dragon Freight Car
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Description:
Mythical beasts are great--
especially when they haul your
stuff.

Requirements:
2 Pirate Necklaces
2 Ruto Crowns
6 Bee Larvae

------------------------
Dessert: ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ For the
gluttons of train life. Sure to
attract anyone with even a
slight sweet tooth. The
strawberry-filled Swiss Roll
design of the engine looks
particularly scrumptious. As an
added touch, the whistle is
reminiscent of toy train
whistles.

Anybody would be happy to ride
in a car this sweet!

4 Ruto Crowns

---------------
Pie Freight Car ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: This car is
designed to make train
enthusiasts drool.

Requirements:
1 Palace Dish
1 Goron Amber
3 Dark Pearl Loops

------------------------
Gold: ¯¯¯¯ A luxurious train
set. Simply magnificent.
Everything is gold, certainly
not with cheap gold paint.
Lower-class people would kill to
have a train this trendy. Even
the whistle sounds like it's
spraying gold dust everywhere to
share the wealth.

---------------
Golden Engine ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Description: Even the smoke on
this spectacular wonder seems to
have some gold
 in it.

Requirements:
1 Alchemy Stone
2 Ancient Gold Pieces
3 Mystic Jades

enough for heavy
 jobs!

Throughout the game, you can
learn up to five songs for the
Spirit Flute, acquired fairly
early in the game. To learn a
Spirit Flute song, you must find
a sound stone. These are kinda
like the sound stones in
Twilight Princess. They are
shaped like a space shuttle, and
have a hole in the middle in
which wind blows through. Check
it to see colored light bubbles
emitting from the stone as the
wind blows through it. These
light bubbles tell you which
notes to play in which order.
Just bring out the Spirit Flute
while you're checking a sound
stone and follow the light
bubbles.

This will list the songs, where
to get them, how to play them,
and what they do. There are
checkmark boxes beside each song
to mark off what you got in case
you print this out.

see you.

From Alfonzo [ ] ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Dear Link, I'm sorry I wasn't
able to help you more. That guy

better now. Would you mind
coming to get me at the castle
and taking me back to Aboda
Village? Thanks!

From Linebeck [ ] ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
My dear boy, Even though I'm no
longer with you, I'm sure you're
faring well. But just in case
you run into some hard
times...I've buried the Regal
Ring in a safe spot for you to
claim. It wouldn't be fun if I
told you exactly where, though,
would it? Use these clues to
find it.

1. To enter the hiding spot,
   sound the light and follow
   its beam.
2. Inside, go 4 steps north and
   6 steps west from where the
   lights cross.

And that's where you'll discover
the treasure! Best of luck to
you! HA HA!

ever seen this place before?

From Ferrus (3) [ ]

Your aquatic pal,

Hi, little engineer! How has
your freight car been holding
up? Things here have been

treasure I hid in the Dark Ore
Mine as a young one. I cannot
remember where I hid it. he
hints on the map might help you
find it though. Hope to see you

Like any Zelda game, there's
bosses at the end of each
dungeon. However, there are also
other boss-like enemies that you
must face in places outside
dungeons. These will be listed
as well. Overall, the bosses
will be listed in the order you
face them in-game.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Stagnox, Armored Colossus
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: End of Forest
Temple

This ugly-looking, giant stag
beetle has its abdomen as its
weakness. It covers it with
poison mist, so it won't be that
easy to reach it. It starts off
the battle by constantly facing
you no matter where you move.
Just keep still until you see it
move forward, as it will attempt
to knock you around with its
horns. Move away and quickly get
behind it. Blow away the mist
with the Whirlwind, then strike
its abdomen until it turns
around. Repeat the process, and
Stagnox will change its
strategy.

It will start flying around the
room now, and will eventually
stop in front of you on the top
screen. After a while, it will
spawn three Blastworms and throw
them down towards you. Kill them
all except for one, and make
sure it's curled up. Keep the
Whirlwind aimed at that
Blastworm, and wait for Stagnox
to come flying down towards you.
Blow a whirlwind towards the
Blastworm while aiming at
Stagnox and it will blow up in
its face, making it fall on its
back. Slash the abdomen until it
gets up and flies away. Repeat
until it's finally dead.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Rocktite ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: Overworld

This massive, quadriped rock
monster shows up in caves and
chases after your train. Your
first encounter with it is in
the Snow Realm when reaching the
Snow Sanctuary. Its weakpoint is
the eye in its body. Just shoot
its eye with the cannon until it
gets knocked back. Repeat the
process as it gets faster and
faster to eventually defeat it.

The second time you encounter a
Rocktite is when traveling to
the Sand Temple. This Rocktite
takes more to kill, and
sometimes keeps its eye closed.
To make it open its eye, shoot
an explosive barrel by it. This
will damage it and make it open
its eye. Keep shooting until
dead.

The third and final time you
encounter this boss is actually
an optional encounter. It is in
the cave next to Dark Ore Mine.
This Rocktite takes even more
hits to kill, but is also
accompanied by Tektites to also
chase you down. You'll have to
deal with the strategy used in
the second fight, as well as
kill any Tektites you see to
prevent any added damage.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Fraaz, Master of Icy Fire
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: End of Snow Temple

This is practically the same
character as Blaaz from Phantom
Hourglass. However, the way to
defeat this boss works
differently, and he's also
surprisingly hard...at least for
the time you face him. Right
now, Fraaz uses two forms of
power: ice and fire. He'll bloat
up and charge up either power,
and you can tell which power
depending on the color. (Blue or
Red) Whichever color he is,
light up your Boomerang of the
opposite color and have it hit
him. If he's still the same
color but smaller, do it again
quickly. Fraaz will be stunned,
so get some hits in. Repeat
until he splits into two.

Look at the top screen. See the
color that the split up Fraaz
bodies are? With one Boomerang
throw, have it touch each body
with its weakness. If done
correctly, Fraaz will become
whole again. If not, both bodies
will spew fire and ice around,
so don't get hit. Now that Fraaz
is joined up again, he will
destroy both torches. So how do
we deal with him now? Use his
own attacks against him.
Whatever he fires, will stay on
the stage for a while
afterwards. Use the element
that's against him when you can,
and attack when he's stunned. He
will eventually split up again.
Do the same: wait for the Fraaz
bodies to fire their elements,
then target them with their
weaknesses. Fraaz will once
again become whole. Repeat until
he's dead.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Big Blin ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: Train ride to Ocean
Sanctuary

This hulking monstrosity sort of
looks like a Moblin. It is
apparantly a pirate leader of
sorts. In this boss fight, you
have to protect Carben from it.
However, it seems to be
invincible, never flinching when
you attack it. Thankfully, it
walks very slow. It has a
powerful swinging arm though, so
when you see it get ready to
attack, get away quickly. If you
get hit, you'll be dizzy for a
little bit. Rub the stylus on
the screen quickly to shake
yourself out of it.

As long as you constantly
distract the Big Blin, it'll
never get close to Carben.
Eventually, it finally keels
over after taking such a
beating. Be vigilant on the top
screen though! A Miniblin may
approach Carben while you're
busy with the Big Blin, and if
it's given enough time, will
cage Carben and take him away,
meaning you'll have to start
over.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Phytops, Barbed Menace
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: End of Ocean Temple

This boss is like...a barbed
green octopus. Its head is
covered in purple gunk, and
shoots it at you. It blocks your
path left and right with its
barbed tentacles. What to do?
Well, the preliminary to this
boss gave you a clue. Pull out a
thorn from one of the tentacles,
and throw it at the head. Some
of the gunk will disappear,
partially revealing an eye. Keep
pulling off thorns and throwing
them at the head until the eye
is fully revealed. Pull off one
more thorn and throw it at the
eye.

Phytops will screech, then lay
its head against the side of its
pool. Head over there and slash
its eye as much as you can.
After attacking it, it will
retreat into the water, and out
comes four tentacles. Two of
them trap you in, and two of
them try to whip at you. Avoid
them. Phytops' head will re-
surface, so repeat. After taking
enough damage, Phytops will use
its whipping tentacles while you
have to expose its eye, making
it more difficult. Eventually,
Phytops will be downed.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Cragma, Lava Lord
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Encountered:
End of Fire Temple

This monstrosity is our boss?
Well, it's pretty imposing, but
don't lose your composure! Its
main attack is lifting itself
up, then slamming its fist down
onto the ground. This does a
full heart of damage if it hits,
but also makes molten rocks fall
down to try to hurt you even
more. Some of them contain arrow
refills though, so it's not all
bad. Your objective here is to
shoot an Arrow at the glowing
spot at Cragma's belly when it
lifts up to attack. Cragma will
get angry, then plunge both its
fists onto the ground. Be
careful and dodge this. This
will make a larger boulder fall
down. Blast it away with a Bomb,
or have Cragma crush it, to find
a rock panel. Pick it up and
throw it at one of the geysers
to the right, and use the rock
panel lifted by a geyser to hop
onto the mine cart. Looks can be
deceiving, so you may fall into
the lava a few times.

Once on the mine cart, you'll
ride along rails surrounding
Cragma. You're supposed to shoot
its glowing spots, including the
ones on its hands. As you shoot
the glowing spots, you'll get
higher and higher until you're
at Cragma's eye level. Shoot its
eye with an arrow to finally
stun Cragma, sinking it down to
the floor. The mine cart will
drop you off so you can slash
its head to damage it. Repeat
this elongated process until
Cragma is defeated! Remember,
the falling rocks that fall when
Cragma slams its fist down
sometimes drop Arrow pickups, so
use that to your advantage.

O-O Byrne ¯¯¯¯¯ Encountered:
After Floor 23 of Tower of
Spirits

This fellow is extremely quick
and agile. He hops around the
arena, occasionally stopping to
shoot some energy waves. You can
have them hit Zelda: she won't
be harmed, and each shot drops a
heart. Eventually, Byrne will
yell, the camera angle will
change, and a purple crosshairs
will appear on you. Move around
so that Byrne's gauntlet will
miss you. Once it's caught onto
the floor, move Zelda to the
hand and pull it, causing Byrne
to fall off. Go over and slash
him as Link.

At this point, Byrne will try
something new. After sending his
energy waves, he'll attempt to
charge up an energy ball. This
is aimed right at Zelda, so move
her around to dodge it, as if
she gets hit with it, she gets
stunned just long enough for
Byrne to throw his gauntlet at
you without any danger. Once he
starts his gauntlet throw, call
Zelda so she'll move with you,
as Byrne will try to hit Zelda
with his gauntlet as well. Once
the gauntlet is stuck, pull it
as Zelda again and slash Byrne.

Now Byrne will try to get up
close and personal, using his
gauntlet to beat up Link and
Zelda. He mostly focuses on Link
though, but if you use Zelda to
try to slash him, he jumps to
dodge. What you have to do is
slash Byrne relentlessly with
Link. He won't be able to block
every attack, so you can deal
some damage. Eventually, Byrne
will start up an attack in which
he charges straight at you. Get
behind Zelda, and when Byrne
charges, Zelda will hold Byrne
in place, leading for you to
slash his back. That's about all
of Byrne's tricks, so keep
dealing damage in that way until
the fight is over.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Skeldritch, Ancient Demon
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: End of Sand Temple

This giant skull on a tower of
armored bones awakens! It uses
two attacks: throws a boulder at
you, and uses a piercing laser
attack. Just constantly roll
(but not so much that you get
yourself dizzy) to avoid the
laser attack, and stop the
boulder with a big barrier of
sand using your Sand Wand. While
the boulder is stopped, move it
onto one of the catapults. Take
care to move away when you see
Skeldritch summon another
boulder, as when two boulders
collide, both disintegrate. When
the boarded catapult is lined
up, hit the switch and the
boulder will fly into
Skeldritch, breaking apart a
section. Repeat this again for
the next section, just make it
known that he throws three
boulders this time.

Skeldritch's next section does
not have its weak spot in the
front like the previous two this
time: it's on Skeldritch's right
side, with armor covering the
rest. Take note that Skeldritch
always faces you...stop a
boulder, place it on a catapult,
then move until you see the
boarded catapult on the right of
Skeldritch. When the coast is
clear for you, shoot that
catapult's switch with an Arrow,
flinging the boulder and
breaking apart that section.

Skeldritch's next section has
its weak spot behind him. Do the
same thing you did before: board
a catapult with a boulder, move
until it's behind Skeldritch,
then hit the switch with the
Boomerang this time, so you can
get it around Skeldritch. Take
note though, Skeldritch now
fires three super fast boulders.
You'll have to create an
extremely thick wall of sand to
stop these boulders. The next
section has its weak point on
the left. Again, use the same
strategy as you used for the
previous section, Boomerang and
all. This time, Skeldritch fires
four of those super-fast
boulders, so take heed.

Now that only a skull remains,
Skeldritch's helmet has fallen
off, revealing its vulnerable
head. It will now chase after
you relentlessly. Use the Sand
Wand to create a wall of sand in
front of it to stop it
momentarily, then quickly get
behind it, raise yourself, then
do a series of slashes. Repeat
this until Skeldritch is finally
bested.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Dark Link *OPTIONAL*
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Encountered: End of
Take 'Em All On level 3

Well this is certainly a
surprise. You face your dark
replica here. Make sure you
break the pots before the battle
to heal up. Dark Link uses the
Bow, Bombs, sword slashes, sword
spin, and a fancy jumping slash.
It always blocks your attacks
unless you slash it when its
guard is down, like when it's
holding a Bomb, firing Arrows,
or landing from a jump slash.
For a final battle in this
minigame, it's actually pretty
easy to dodge the attacks. The
only challenge comes in striking
Dark Link when it's open. Once
it's taken enough hits, it'll
use a Great Spin, where it spins
around fast with sword extended.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Demon Train ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: Dark Realm

Yes, a battle between two
trains, and obviously the Demon
Train is a lot bigger than you.
It takes place on four Tracks,
and the Demon Train always takes
up two. Dark fires may sometimes
be on the track, so you'll have
to be vigilant and switch Tracks
when necessary. The objective is
to destroy each section of the
Demon Train before it escapes,
and it's obviously done in
phases.

The first phase has you dealing
with the cargo car. This
constantly drops exploding
barrels on your path, so you
have to destroy them. To
actually damage the car, you
have to shoot the barrels when
they're still in the process of
being launched. If the Demon
Train yells, then immediately go
reverse. You won't actually go
reverse, but you'll slow down
tremendously. When the Demon
Train yells, that means it's
going to switch Tracks in an
attempt to ram into you. Once
you dodge that, switch Tracks
yourself so you don't run into
it. After the cargo car is
destroyed, move on to phase two.

This time you'll have to deal
with laser cannons. Get even
with the Demon Train and shoot
the guns of the lasers to damage
them. Each laser gun requires
two shots to destroy. Again,
watch for dark fires on the
tracks and whenever the Demon
Train tries to change Tracks.
After the laser cannon car is
destroyed, phase three will come
into effect.

More lasers here, except there's
a LOT of them. There's not much
you can do as far as dodging
them goes (unless you want to be
cool), just hit the pegs that
fire lasers from the car. Once
you've destroyed them all, the
Demon Train will slow down and
get behind you. Fire at its face
until it decides to switch
Tracks. Get behind it quickly,
and try it once more. Once the
lasers are gone again and the
Demon Train gets behind you, it
will switch Tracks so that it's
actually behind you, and will
slowly catch up. You can't
escape it at this point, so just
shoot the face until the fight
is over.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Malladus ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Encountered: After Demon Train

We're on top of the Demon Train,
and it has started moving,
leaving our train behind! We
need to head over to Malladus,
in Zelda's body, at the other
end of the train. However, Cole
is going to be rather irritating
here. As he knows Zelda's
"weakness", he'll constantly
spawn ghost rats to Zelda so
she'll get scared. If they're
not gone fast enough, they'll
shock her, and Cole will control
Zelda's Phantom body with ghost
strings. Use the Boomerang to
cut those strings if this
happens. Otherwise, trace a path
for Zelda towards Malladus,
while you keep Cole at bay.

You can keep him from summoning
ghost rats if you slash at him.
He'll disappear for a second,
giving you some time. When you
get close enough, Malladus will
attempt to fire a strong laser
at Link to push him back. Stay
behind Zelda to avoid this. Even
further, and parts of the Demon
Train will twist and sway,
making it difficult to get over
there. Once Zelda has reached
Malladus, she will grab ahold of
her body to pin him down. It's
not helping much, but at least
it's distracting Malladus and
Cole. Shoot a Light Arrow
straight at Malladus to end this
battle.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Malladus *FINAL BOSS*
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ For the first phase of
this battle, Zelda will attempt
to focus her power so that we
can have a better chance of
defeating Malladus. During this,
you have to defend her from the
fireballs Malladus tries to fire
at her. Just use sword slashes.
It's simple at first, but
quickly gets harder with the
more power Zelda focuses.
Eventually, Malladus will
attempt to fire multiple
fireballs at once. To protect
Zelda from them, just get close
to her and do a spin attack at
the right time to deflect them
all. You have unlimited tries,
so long as Link is alive. After
this phase is done, time will
stop briefly, protecting Link
and Zelda.

Second phase really doesn't have
to deal with Malladus at all. In
fact, to summon the full power
of the spirits and Lokomos to
help you win the battle, you
have to perform a sacred duet
with Zelda. The notes for you to
play are: Red, Purple, Yellow,
Light Blue, Red. Keep the tips
in mind, this is the hardest
thing to do with the Spirit
Flute! After having done it, the
Lokomos will join in the epic
duet, creating a beautiful song.
This starts the third phase of
the battle.

Malladus now has a weak spot
revealed on his back. Zelda
takes your Bow of Light and asks
you to distract Malladus so she
can fire at Malladus's back. You
can control both Link and Zelda
now. The top screen shows an
over-the-shoulder view of Zelda.
You have a new button on the
bottom screen. Tapping this
makes Zelda fire a Light Arrow.
Basically, get Link behind
Malladus and slash his arms and
legs to distract him. It doesn't
hurt him, only distract him.
Once Malladus has his back faced
to you, strafe Zelda around by
tracing a path for her so that
she can get a clear shot of
Malladus's back. When the
crosshairs on the top screen
turn yellow, you have a clear
shot! Fire that Light Arrow.

Fire two more successful shots,
and Malladus will collapse...but
it's not over yet. We need to
drive the Lokomo Sword through
Malladus's skull to kill him,
but we need to cut off his
horns. All you can do right now
is slash at one of the horns
until it's cut. Now that one
horn is cut, Malladus will be on
to your games. You can no longer
fire a Light Arrow just any time
you get a clear shot, as he'll
dodge it. Instead, you have to
distract him long enough until
he roars. Once he's roared,
immediately shoot a Light Arrow
at his back, assuming you have a
clear shot. Fire two more and
Malladus will collapse again.
Cut the other horn off.

He hasn't changed his pattern at
this point. Keep firing Light
Arrows at his back once you have
a clear shot and while he roars.
After just one Light Arrow,
he'll collapse again. He must be
getting weak. Slash the gem on
his head. Now you must rub the
stylus and keep the Lokomo Sword
in there as long as possible
while Zelda runs over to give
you a hand. Once she's there,
continue moving the stylus
rapidly, and the fight...will be
over. Malladus has been killed,
once and for all...

This game, like Phantom
Hourglass, has a multiplayer
feature! This is improved on
from PH's system, in my opinion.
It now supports up to four
players in battle. The only
problem? There's no online
capability! So, if you really
want to play Battle mode, you'll
have to find some of your local
friends who have the game too
and battle with them...if
they're willing. This section
details the game modes available
for multiplayer, along with a
few tips.

O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
O-O Tag Mode /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Tag Mode is
something you can use to trade
Treasures with someone else.
It's actually pretty simple:
pick a Treasure and drag it onto
one of the packages on the
right. There are three packages
and only one Treasure can fit in
each. So you can trade up to
three Treasures. When you're
ready, tap Send and you will
send your Treasures to someone
else who is also in Tag Mode. In
return, you will get whatever
Treasures that other person
stowed away in his three
packages.

This is simply useful for
getting Treasures that may be
rare on your game, but plentiful
on another's. Getting these rare
Treasures on your file can be
used for finishing up your Train
Part collection, or to use them
to sell. I actually used this
mode just a few days ago to
complete my train collection, so
I was able to release this guide
ahead of time.

O-O Battle / ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Battle Mode is a place where you
can play against up to three
other friends in local wireless
battle. As I have not played
this as of now, this section
will be devoid of information.
This will be updated when I have
played Battle mode enough times,
however, so if you want to see
what all Battle Mode has to
offer or for any possible tips,
keep my guide bookmarked and
check occasionally.

Well, that's about it. I hope
you liked this guide as much as
I enjoyed making it. I have no
idea what Zelda game I will
cover next, but keep a close eye
on my progress! I may even throw
a curveball and release
something not expected! Anyway,
see ya next time!
