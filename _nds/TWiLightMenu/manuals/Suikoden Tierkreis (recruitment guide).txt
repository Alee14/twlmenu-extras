================================

First of all: Hi. Yes. This is
Ikano from suikox. I just wanted
to clear that up before somone
claims I stole my own FAQ
(haha?) (I originally posted
this FAQ on the forums there
before putting it on here) So
yes, Hageshi@GameFaqs =
Ikano@suikox. Got that? Good.

So anyway...this "FAQ" serves as
a quick "cheat sheet" on being
able to get all 108 Stars of
Destiny on your playthrough
without missing any of them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Note:: This FAQ went through the
process of changing over
Japanese names to their
respective English/localized
names... ~If there are any major
errors in that regard...please
try to reach/contact me in some
way...

[I created/compiled this whole
FaQ single-handedly...so I have
a harder time trying to keep
this version (and at the same
time, the suikox version)
correct/updated]

**At this point in time. This Fa
--As I believe I could probably
in the future...I'll probably
never say it's 100% done...--

But as of now, I believe this is
pretty complete as is and there
won't be "regular updates" from
now [March 30, 2009] on...

4/16/09 --Minor edit: Got some
Messages "pointing out" an error
that...isn't really an
error...but so...minor edit just
so these specific "complaints"
stop...

---
3/28/09 --Finally got all 108
SoD in my English version
playthrough. Woot! So now...all
the characters recruit info
should by pretty much correct
and not as vague as it was
originally! And so...there
should no longer be anymore
"frequent edits/updates" unless
I find (or someone points out to
me) any SERIOUSLY MAJOR typos.

[[although...there still seems
to be an issue with Luvais'
recruit wondow...]]

Thank you for your patience!
Thanks for using this FAQ! Have
a nice day! ((What else am I
suppossed to say? aha...))
-------

3/26/09 -- fixed/edited several
more SoD recruit info (I've
recruited everyone /played up to
the [Mun Tsang] point on my
ORDER List...so everyone who was
recruitable before that
point...their info should now be
correct and clearer)!

~Also, if you didn't notice, am
working on putting in the
English titles for the requests
so nobody should get confused
about that anymore! ...hopefully
-------

3/25/09 -- fixed/edited a little
bit of the Megion and Lathilda
entries

3/24/09 -- found a
typo...again...(ARG!)...also
edited/fixed/clarified some SoD
recruit info...expect more as I
go through my latest
playthrough... (1st english
playthrough though 4th including
japanese playthroughs ._.; )

3/22/09 -- (*)Fixed some "star
spelling" typos. Hopefully
they're all correct now.

(*)Luvais' recruit
procedure/requirements is more
clarified... ...however his
exact recruit window is still
not 100% sure, though I've
marked a rough estimate based
off of his dialogue during
recruitment... ORDER list has
also been shifted around a
little to reflect this
"estimate"

(*)Gadburg has also now been
placed correctly on the ORDER
list.

(*)Missed putting some SoD
entries in all-caps, this has
now been fixed

(*)Little "notes" about the
recruiting of Tongatihi,
Hafin/Nakil, Goro, Hina, Savina,
and Lathilda have been added.
Check them if you're having
trouble with recruiting any of
the beforementioned.

(*)A few more "how to recruit"
info has been edited to be
slightly more clear

(*)98% of the
location/city/dungeon names have
now been englishified though
some may have minor spelling
errors... ((It confounds me how
people can't figure out "snowy
mountain" = Chouli Mts.))
--------------------------------

3/20/09 -- I changed all SoD
names to all caps so that so
that if you're able to do a
"case-sensitive" search...you'll
find what you're looking for
easier. Hopefully...(check the
SUGGESTED USE section to see
what I mean)

Not sure if all computer's
"search functions" have the
option though...but it'll help
those who can search like that
at least...

Also fixed a few more typos and
caught a few more Japanese SoD
names I missed "english-
ifying"...although I was half-
asleep while doing it so I don't
actually remember how far I
got...
--------------------------------

3/19/09 -- (1)THIS IS IT! Prob.
One of the most LOOKED-FORWARD-
TO updates! All SoD character
names have been ENGLISHIFIED!
...Hopefully I switched em all
over correctly...I'll
doublecheck again when I'm able
to get around to english-ifying
location & dungeon names...

Also, while swapping over the
SoD names...I caught alot of
ORDER-list <=/=> TABLET-list
discrepancies...

I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR ALL
THOSE THAT WERE PUZZLED OVER THE
FACT THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND
INFO ON A SPECIFIC CHARACTER CUZ
OF THOSE ERRORS!!!

(2)After struggling with trying
to read random Japanese
sources...started an attempt to
put in info about "permanently
missed charas in the "ORDER
LIST"

(3)Am in the process of trying
to clarify Rubias/Lubias'
apparently irregular recruit
event... (originally mistakingly
thought to be automatic) ...so
ya'll will have to do a little
legwork/wandering around
searching for him yourself (if
you're going for all 108) while
I try to clarify the EXACT
requirements...

(4) Did a little re-clarifying
on some of the SoD's "how to
recruit" info.

(5) Did a little "redesigning"
of this FAQ...kind of
--------------------------------

3/18/09 - Hand-ful of edits.
First of all: edited/reformatted
& moved "Q+A" section to top of
FAQ (right under this
section)--cuz it actually has
some kind of IMPORTANT stuff
now)

Secondly: Attempted to convert
some of the names to localized
version based on what names
several others have been
using...however I still don't
have the english version in my
hand to doublecheck said name
changes so there aren't that
many changes yet...

Third: Found & fixed a few more
typos

Oh...and by the way...YES I know
Gadburg is missing in the ORDER
list...but I forget exactly when
he joins...However, he's an auto
recruit anyway so I don't think
it's a very big issue for now...
--------------------------------

3/17/09 - Yomi's entry
apparently had an error in one
of the city names. Still don't
have english version to
doublecheck apparent error so
substituted the city name with
description of town's
location... Also fixed some
minor typos & Added a random Q+A
section at the bottom... though
it's kind of random...
--------------------------------

3/13/09- Got very far on the 3rd
playthrough and FINALLY
successfully collected the 2
SoDs I had missed in 1st and 2nd
playthrough. "Pre-English game
release" version of this FAQ now
pretty much complete!
--Submitted to GameFAQs for uplo
--------------------------------

3/10/09- Got very far on the 2nd
playthrough of Japanese game.
Realized permanently missed 2
out of the 108 SoDs and
restarted the game....yet again.
--------------------------------

3/06/09- Finished first
playthrough of Japanese game.
Typed up first version of FAQ.
(Missed 7 SoDs on 1st
playthrough.)

================================
[SUG01]
-------------------------------S

================================

Due to the fact I wanted to
minimize plot spoilers in the
ORDER LIST, it is listed in such
a way that they are roughly
divided into "plot missions
chunks".

You'll have to play the game and
figure out my spacing yourself.
Therefore...

I suggest using the "ORDER" list
as reference for finding
characters in the "TABLET" list
depending on where you are in
the game, using "What was the
last auto recruit you got" as a
"bookmark"

 CTRL+F and/or COMMAND+F and/or 

((IMPORTANT:: Make your searches
case sensitive if you can! If
you search for a name in ALL
CAPS you will go to that
character's specific "recruit
info" entry. If you do a case
sensitive search with just the
first letter of the name
capitalized...you'll instead hit
other SoD entries that mentions
the character's name. --Just try
it and you'll see what I mean))

But if you don't care much for
being spoiled, ignore my
suggestion.

[QNA01]
--------------------------(RANDO

================================
((Possible spoilers in this
section, be advised!!))

[Does seasonal characters mean I
can run into them everyday of
that season?]

~Uh...no. If you've already
triggered a seasonal event you
have to wait a whole year -until
that season returns- to try it
again

==
[Why do some recruit events not
trigger when they're supposed
to?]

~ For your information, if you
are in the middle of a plot
mission or "character"request
**SEVERAL RECRUIT EVENTS WILL
NOT TRIGGER CORRECTLY**. So if
you can't get a recruit event to
trigger when it's suppossed to,
make sure you're NOT in the
middle of a plot mission or
another character request.
However, missions that require
time to pass does not block
recruit events.

Also sometimes, automatic events
and recruit events overlap and
so the automatic events take
priority. Don't panic too soon!
Just try to trigger the recruit
event again when you think the
'Automatic event' is done.
==

[Which and when are character's
permanently missable?]

~ I unfortunately did not keep
track of when is the last chance
to recruit a character. Though
I'm pretty sure Nakil, Hafin,
Wustum, Luvais, and Geschutz &
co. are. (As well as Nomno &
Khemia whom recruit events
depend on someone earlier
mentioned).

I do know for certain that the
attack on [Cynas] is the cutoff
for getting *ANY* SoDs. So if
you wanted to

***BE SURE TO GET THEM ALL BEFOR
===

[where is Cynas? ] ~ Have you
seriously touched the game at
all? Cynas is the "Order of the
One-True Way's "base of
operations" so-to speak. It's
the city north of Fort Ark and
you should've visited there in
the beginning of the game as
part of the plot.
===

[How to complete "gathering
animals" quest, other quests
that result in an SoD joining,
etc.]

~ I am not 100% sure on the
specifics to successfully do ALL
"SoD-join related missions" so
that you succeed 100% of the
time (hopefully a Quest/mission
FaQ will cover it better) ...but
from my experience...the
Animal's Quest needs all people
sent on it to have an agility
stat of 140 on average, "goods"
quests need a HIGH luck, and
Morrin's "luring Icas" quest
needs YOUNG & beautiful and/or
CUTE, women. [sorry Selen...Icas
doesn't like you... =p]

But again, this is only based on
my experience and is probably
incorrect...
===

[You have an error! FIX IT!!
NOW!!!]

~ I'm so sorry! I did 98% of
this FaQ single-handedly with
(initially) only the Japanese
version of the game...despite
the fact I'm not fluent in
Japanese [besides bits and
pieces I've picked up from
anime/ trying to self-teach
myself...] (Although I am fluent
in Mandarin...though I have no
idea if that really helped...)

However, I should also
mention...please check the
version I have posted on
suikox.com forums to see if I've
addressed the error & for more
recent changes. (as updates on
that version may be faster than
this version)

If I didn't mention it
there...THEN you can try to
contact me about it.
===

[Then...how to reach/contact
you?]

~ Unfortunately I don't like to
leave my email everywhere so I
guess that leaves you these
"simpler" options:
1) I check the GameFaQs
   Tierkreis forums semi-
   regularly, (while I still
consider this FaQ as
"incomplete" at least)
especially to see if there is
any "griping" about errors
appearing in this FaQ

2) PM me on suikox.com. As
   mentioned before...My
   username is Ikano over there.

3) If you know how to use
   irc...I sit in suikox's irc
   channel sometimes.
It's on Rizon.

fight you again, win again and
he'll run off yet again. Later
on there is a mission where you
meet with him and after talking
to him he runs off)) <---These
additional encounters appear to
be optional...though I have not
confirmed it [the lack of 2nd
encounter specifically] myself

After Shams' join's you, you can
run into him in Kureyah's house
in [Sarusabil] and speak with
him. (*NOTE: He does not seem to

him and he will automatically
join. Gorno is found in a
deadend in Mt. Svatgol

then on next fork go down.

If you came in from [Grayridge]
mine's -3rd floor(not available
until sometime after successful
defense of Pharamond)-- when you
reach the screen where every
wall looks reddish/fire-y, just
follow the path then at fork go
straight south)

Note: Ordovik confirmed NOT to
work ((mysterious huh?)) ~~

Chisei --HAFIN :: After Asad
'officially' joins you (along
with the knights). He will, at
some point leave your HQ
temporarily (meaning you won't
be able to put him in your
party). Let some time go by and
when Asad returns, he will have
brought Hafin back with him at
which point Hafin will join
[*easily miss-able--this event
triggers randomly]

((**Hafin and Nakil's recruit
events can be flipped and can be
done out of order-- see NAKIL
for the description of the other
recruit event)) ~~

Chikatsu --KEFLEN :: After
[Janam] kingdom dissapears, you
can find him collapsed in the
desert within the Mysterious
Ruins. Insist that you want to
help him, then go to the deepest
part of those ruins to trigger
an event. Afterwards, offer to
let him stay at your place and
he'll follow you back to HQ (not
yet joined).

After [Rarohenga] appears...talk
to Keflen again and he will say
he remembers something, and will
ask if you have time to help
him. Say that you do and take
him to the ruins where you found
him collapsed in...go to the
deepest part of the ruins again
and an event will occur. After
some dialogue Keflen will join
you. ~~

Chitou --YADIMA :: Be sure to
talk to him in his little hamlet
in the first "world map area" of
the game. His "hamlet" is
located south -and slightly
east- of Hero's hometown. Talk
to him a second time on your way
back later.

Sometime after your HQ upgrades,
he will appear at your HQ's
outdoor area (past the dock) [If
he's not there go back to his
hamlet to talk to him and he
should appear when you go back
to HQ]. Talk to him then go back
to Moana. A request titled
"Plowin' the field" will appear.

Complete it successfully
(sending people with high attack
should work) then go back and
talk to him afterwards. He'll
"officially" join. ~~

Chikyou --HINA :: A little after
the automatic recruiting of
Rajim. (Which occurs a little
after your return from [Woodland
Village)] ) She will make a
request titled "Letter from
Lonomakua" and you're

After completion of the request.
They will all gather in your

leaders somehow" ~~

Chian --MOURGENT :: At some
point after recruiting Yula,
enter the Blade's room in the HQ
and you'll overhear Yula and
Chrodechild talking about a
swordsman. (Do not have Yula
and/or Chrodechild in your party
if you have trouble triggering
the convo)

After some time (about around
the time the desert appears) a
request titled "Request from
Gadburg" will appear. ((The
request does not appear if you
have Yula, or any of the Blades
Knights in your party))

Accept it and you will
automatically be taken to a ruin
where you will run into
Mourgent. Yula will appear from
behind you and she and Mourgent
will fight one-on-one. If she
beats him, Mourgent will be
recruited. ((Possibly do not
need to beat him to join?
*untested)) ~~

you will spot her standing
outside the "castle entrance".
Talk to her, then bring
Chrodechild to talk to her and
after some dialogue she will
request a one-on-one with her.
Have Chrodechild win and you can
recruit Yula. (Note: If
Chrodechild is in your party
when you initially go to find
her, you'll have to speak with
her twice) ~~

Chibaku --NOMNO :: After your HQ
upgrades, try talking to Nomno
and he won't budge. Talk to
Nemne afterwards and she'll make
a comment about Nomno.

After successfully recruiting
Wustum, talk to him (Wustum)
within your HQ (after talking to
Nemne) and Nomno will finally
get up and move. He'll then
officially be added to your
roster/tablet. ~~

Chizen --NUZHAT :: You will
first run into her if you enter
[Sarusabil] after completing the
"2nd Empress Consort Rizwan"
request. (The "run-in" is
apparently not necessary for the
recruitment)

After you're HQ upgrades and you
fixed your elevator by
recruiting Balsam (See BALSAM
for details on that). Ride your
elevator down to the HQ's cellar

further to run into Rufa and
another mandatory battle will
occur. There will be a small
event after and then he (and
Rufa) will be recruited. ~~

meet him in [Grayridge]'s

has been upgraded, go up to the
roof immediately after and
trigger the Hero commenting to
himself about the "trek up the
stairs."

Go back to talk to Balsam and
when given a dialogue choice say
"It'll be interesting?" (the 2nd
choice),

He will then follow you to your
HQ to take a look (a cut-in
scene should appear
automatically right when you
enter) ...after a lot of
dialogue he will say he can fix
it if you bring him a "pump".
Find that "pump" (it can be
found in [Naineneis]'s trading

bring it to him. After he fixes
the elevator (he needs 10 days
to fix it) he will join you. ~~

Chiin --MAYBELLE :: You can
first run into her standing next
to the spire/statue located on

after the HQ was upgraded (and
Hero already checked out the

commented that "it really
disappeared"). After some
dialogue the Hero will run away
from her.

After getting the support of the
Furious Roar, there will be a
request made by her titled "Find
my Fated Lover <3" Accept it and
then go to the Hero's room in
the HQ. After some screams, Jale
will "forcefully escort" her
out.

Afterwards if you leave your HQ
via the exits (not via the
warps) she'll be outside (on the
world map) mumbling to herself.
(If she's not there... putting
some females in your party might
make her appear)

If you acknowledge she's there,
then you will automatically be
brought to your room with her
again. After the event/dialogue
immediately re-enter Hero's room
again and she will ask to join.
~~

Chii --RUFA :: joins with Kow
Low ((See KOW LOW))

Chiri --LUBBERKIN :: At a
certain point in the story
(Around after your return from
[Woodland Village], two
different one-star requests will
appear requested by Marica
(titled "The Other Marica's
World") and Jale (titled
"Atrie's World") respectively.

Do either one and upon finishing
one of their quests and
reporting in, Hotupa and Moana
will mention that while
Jale/Marica was over there they
discovered a person from our
world trapped over there from
the [Grayridge] mine portal.

After a series of events
Lubberkin will appear from the
portal, bawl his eyes out...then

a corner of the town's alley.
Bring Logan to talk to him and

him. ~~

Chisyun --YOD :: joins with
Balsam ((see BALSAM))

Chiraku --RAMIN :: After the
plot event where Shams joins, go

marketplace and you'll see Ramin
playing music to a crowd. He
will run off when a royal guard
dashes in. Immediately after a
request by a porpos-kin titled
"Discordent Countermeasures"
will appear, accept it then go
to [Naineneis] town circle and
you will see him playing music
again. Hero will yell at him to
stop and again he will run off.

Last go to [Cragbark's] plaza
(do not need to accept a mission
beforehand) and before he plays
music again, Hero will grab him
and drag him out of town.
Immediately after you enter a
battle and he shows off his

he better take Ramin back to HQ
with him. ~~

talking with Nofret and her
"gang" you'll be given a
dialogue choice. Pick the first
one and you'll enter in a battle
against her and her gang.
((NOTE: Battle is optional))

After beating them, exit the
area and put Shams and Manaril
in your party, then return to
Nofret again and speak with her.
((No you can't make it go
quicker by having them in your
party on the get-go...I already
tried))

After more dialogue a request
titled "Help Them Dig" will
become available. Successfully
complete the mission then return
back to Nofret -again with Shams

more dialogue, she'll finally
join you. ~~

Buchse and Geschutz

Chima --NAMNA :: After Neira
permanently moves into your HQ,
Namna will visit her room every
"Bud" season. Be sure to talk to
him at least once between plot
missions. Before the mission to
attack [Fort Ark] (the earliest)
when you speak to him the Hero
can choose to pick something
along the lines of "Why not stay
here instead of running back and
forth?" (2nd choice I believe)

He will hesitate and mention
that he needs to watch over the
porpos-kin diety's temple at
which point Neira suddenly goes
into "deity mode." And will
convince him to join.

Note: He apparently also appears
in Neira's room when it's
"Sprout" season as well...

**2nd note: PLEASE TRY TO START
If you start talking to him VERY
LATE in the game, he will be
missable as the game won't think
enough time has passed for the
Hero to ask him why he won't
stay instead.** ~~

recruiting more than 10 SoDs (A
message from her may appear
while you're on the map if

cafeteria(or bar if HQ has not
upgraded yet) and she will be

her will trigger additional
dialogue from Marica ~~

Hafin joins, return to Mislato
river with Asad in your party
and you should run into Nakil.

requested by her titled "Find
Somebody" and meet her in the
inn of [Sarusabil]. (Need to
have done "3rd Queen Consort
Kureyah" request first)

mission. Immediately after
discussing with Moana Morrin's
intentions, Moana will put up a
request titled "Bring Icas to
Me"

Complete that mission
successfully (send all
young/cute/pretty girls, one of
the earliest possible parties
that will make it successful is
[Marica, Sisuca, Manaril,

different season: in season

[*]I'd like to credit Due Fuimi

[*]I'd like to thank

[*]I'd like to thank a handful

constantly reminded me not to
treat my English playthrough as

I'm a bit upset that they did a
rather mediocre localization job
localizing Tierkreis...in my
honest opinion...)
