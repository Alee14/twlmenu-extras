 I. Introduction [int01]
--------------------------------

Welcome to my FAQ for Moon! In
this guide you will find
everything that you could
possibly want to know about this
game, and then some! I wrote
this FAQ because at the time of
this writing there were no other
FAQs posted for the game at all
on GameFAQs. So I figured I
would be doing both the site a
favor, with bringing it one step
closer to the "impossible dream"
of having a guide for every game
posted, but I am also helping
you the reader out by
(hopefully) giving you the
answer to whatever you're
looking for.

To provide you with a little
background information about
this game, Moon is a first-
person shooter science-fiction
game for the Nintendo DS. It was
released in the United States on
January 13th, 2009, and as of
this writing, has not been
released in any other region. It
was developed by rookie
Developer Renegade Kid, who at
the time of this writing have
only released on other game:
Dementium: The Ward, also for
Nintendo DS and also a first-
person shooter. Moon was
released by Mastiff, a company
that has been around a little
bit longer than RK with more
experience. The game itself has
a very "indie" feel to it, and
is often compared to another
popular DS title, Metroid Prime
Hunters. Now, I have not played
Metroid Prime Hunters so I won't
even begin to agree or even
disagree with that statement.
The game itself was met with
average reception, but given
that it was not released by a
triple-a company, I would say
that not to be too
disappointing. My personal
opinion - it's a very fun game,
it actually surprised me, which
is always nice.

With that being said, it's on to
the FAQ itself!


--------------------------------
 II. Controls [ctr02]
--------------------------------

The control scehemes in Moon are
very simplistic and
straightforward. You can select
between two schemes, Type 1 and
Type 2. Their functions are as
follows. Please note that I have
also dedicated this section to
detailing al there is to know
about the dual screens and their
use in Moon:

Type 1 (For right-handed
individuals)
------

L button = Shoot Directional pad
= Move character Stylus = Look
around/Aim reticule


Type 2 (for left-handed
individuals)
------

R button = Shoot Y,X,A,B buttons
= Move character Stylus = Look
around/Aim reticule


LOLA-RR10 Controls
------------------

Directional pad Up = Accelerates
Directional pad Down =
Brakes/Reverse Directional pad
Left/Right AND sliding Stylus on
the Touch Screen = Steer Slide
stylus on Touch Screen = Aim
turret/move camera L Button =
Fires weapon Tap the Action Icon
on the touch screen = Exit
vehicle

Top Screen Display
------------------

- Reticule in the center of the 
- HEALTH bar in the lower left-h
left
- Lower right hand corner of the
using as well as how much
ammunition you have left
- At the bottom of the screen is
have the chance to use the
Action Icon. This is basically
here for a reminder to look at
your Touch Screen from time to
time more than anything.

Touch Screen Display
--------------------

- In the center is your navigati
this map will always load. The
triangle represents your
movement.
- At the bottom is your weapon d
as well as how much ammo you
have left. Tap this to alternate
between weapons as well as the
Remote Access Droid
- In the upper left-hand corner 
adjust most game settings. This
can also be accessed from the
Main Menu
- In the upper right-hand corner
map for whatever area you are
presently in you can use this
feature to check locations.
Rooms shaded in blue are areas
you have yet to explore, while
rooms in red signify that you
have been in those areas before.
- At the very top of the Touch S
perform actions. Things like
opening doors, picking up
weapons, retrieving your Remote
Access Droid, saving your game,
all of these and more are
dependent on the Action Icon.


--------------------------------
 III. Weapons [wpn03]
--------------------------------

This section will tell you
everything that you could
possibly want to know about the
weapons in this game! I have
included practically everything
except for the kitchen sink, so
I hope you find it useful!

Weapon: Super Assault Rifle
Description: The standard weapon
of the game, given to all ETEO
officers. It has unlimited ammo
since it is based on "particle
displacement technology" and is
a "high impact weapon". While
the unlimited ammo aspect is
great, the more distance there
is between you and your target,
the less accurate the Super
Assault Rifle is. It fires in
burst of three.

Weapon: Muon Pistol Found In:
Episode 01: Product Storage
Sector I Ammo/Clip Capacity:
16/92 Description: The Muon
Pistol serves as a handgun in
Moon. It is "lightweight,
versitile, and effective in
close-quarters and mid-range
combat scenarios". It fires one
shot per burst, but that single
shot packs a strong punch. Very
portable and not as sluggish to
wield as some other weapons are.

Weapon: Quanta Rifle Found In:
Episode 04: Product Storage
Sector II Ammo/Clip Capacity:
96/192 Description: Now this is
a weapon you don't want to screw
around with, really. It fires
rapid green projectiles at the
enemy. It is basically a great
upgrade to the Super Assault
Rifle, except that it does not
do too much as far as accuracy
is concerned. But it is
definitely the superior weapon
in almost every other way. Very
useful for dealing continous,
hard damage to an enemy, and for
most boss fights it is a
godsend. With a very large ammo
clip once you get the upgrade,
its no wonder it serves as a fan
favorite.

Weapon: Fermion Sniper Found In:
Episode 10: Power Station
Ammo/Clip Capacity: 8/8
Description: Your standard
sniper rifle for the game. Not
intended for close range use,
but that goes without saying.
Can zoom in and zoom out with
ease, and also doesn't hinder
strifing. Packs a strong punch,
most regular foes go down after
1-3 shots at the most.

Weapon: Lepton Spread Found In:
Episode 12: Cold Process
Ammo/Clip Capacity: 16/16
Description: The shotgun/mini
grenade launcher of the game. If
you can get enemies together
when you shoot this thing,
you're going to mess them up.

Weapon: Oxid Cannon Found In:
Episode 14: Irradiated Stratum
Ammo/Clip Capacity: 16/8
Description: This is like the
game's answer to the rocket
launcher. Works incredible for
large group of enemies. And
plus, Kane takes no shockwave
damage from it! Used best
against multiple enemies, or
just one very tough opponent.
Has modest accuracy.

Weapon: Seeker Pod Found In:
Episode 14: Irradiated Stratum
Ammo/Clip Capacity: 8/4
Description: This weapon of mass
destruction is very similar to
the Oxid Cannon, except that it
has some homing capability and
its blast radius is much more
wide and destructive. It's a
shame you acquire it so late in
your adventure. It is most
effective when used against a
large group of enemies, or when
you are bunched up in a narrow
space and facing a large horde.

 IV. Pickups [pik04]
--------------------------------

This is all about the many
things that you can pick up
along your journey.

I even included storyline items
that have very little effect on
the game.



Canisters: Replenish Kane's
health. Blue and alien in
nature. Dropped by some enemies
after they are destroyed.

Ammunition: Ammo for your vaious
weapons in the game. Also
dropped by enemies and found in
various spots of the game.

Power Ups: Max Health Increase
items and Ammo Clip Increase
Items, these forever build up
your health meter and ammunition
supplies. Found throughout some
levels.

Alien Artifacts: When these are
present in a level there are
always three of them to collect.
Collecting all three will unlock
bonus episodes to play.

Red Key: Used to unlock a door
in Episode 01

Data Packets: Used to disable a
security lock

Multi-colored Keys: Used to open
boss chamber doors.


--------------------------------
 V. Miscellaneous [msc05]
--------------------------------

And this section deals with odds
and ends that have a direct
relationship with the game but
are not worthy of their own
section.

Save Points: Spherical
instruments found in safe rooms.
Save your progress by
approaching one and using the
Action Icon. Save points are
useful as they record your data,
provide a spot to determine
where to head to next, and they
fully replenish Major Kane's
health.

Switches: Brightly colored
columns that require you to
examine them using the Action
Icon to disable force fields
that they control.

Map Terminals: Found in areas
that are vast and expansive.
They resemble computer terminals
except that they are much wider
in width. Use the Action Icon
when close enough to a Map
Terminal to download the map
information to your UCA. After
you have done this, you can
check the map of your area by
selecting the "Map" option on
the upper-right hand corner of
the Touch Screen.

Computer Terminal: Scattered
throughout the levels are these
terminals that provide somewhat
cryptic information about
whatever was going on before you
got there. They serve to fill in
some backstory with the overall
plot of the game. You also need
to examine every terminal in a
level in order to earn every
Merit that you can possibly get.

Security Chutes: These vents
will spit out Drone units if an
enemy prescence is detected.
They are more than a nuisance
than anything. But in some cases
they come in handy, giving you
an unlimited supply of Drones to
shoot provides you with health
canisters and ammo pickups.

Tunnels: Small narrow
passageways that Kane cannot fit
into and require the use of your
Remote Access Droid. They are
protected by weak force fields
that can be disabled by your
Remote Access Droid's EMP blast,
allowing it to access them (no
pun intended).

Force Orbs: These pesky little
spheres provide the force fields
that block your way with power.
They can be destroyed by normal
gun fire but most of the time
you are unable to do that until
you find yourself on the other
side of them. This requires you
to use your Remote Access Droid
to go through some tunnels and
temporarily disable them so Kane
can move on. These provide a
good chunk of the game's puzzles
to solve.

LOLA-RR10: The "Low-Gravity
Land-Based Reconnaissance and
Repulse Vehicle", or LOLA for
short. Designed for
reconnaissance missions and
combat on the Moon surface.
Comes equipped with a turret
that emits a powerful laser
blast capable of penetrating
most armor. Reminds me of the
DeLorean for some reason.

Remote Access Droid: A small
little recon droid that links up
with Kane's sensory output and
neural output. Used to get to
areas Kane cannot access to
disable a force field or for
anything else. Due to how it is
setup, any damage it takes will
also affect Kane. It also leaves
Kane vulnerable to attack, and
vice versa once you control Kane
and you backtrack to retrieve
it. Comes equipped with a small
EMP blaster that disables
electronic equipment for a short
amount of time, including
enemies. The maximum capacity of
its EMP blaster is eight, which
recharges quickly after use.

Universal Cognitive Adapter:
Abbreviated as UCA, located in
Kane's suit. It contains a
communication device that allows
you to keep in touch with
General Lambert and Captain
Tsukigami, an advanced scanning
system and a personal navigation
database (all displayed in the
center on the Touch Screen).
This device is what you use to
download maps and keep in touch
with your superior officers. It
is very handy, and neat if you
ask me.


--------------------------------
 VI. Enemies  [ene06]
--------------------------------

There are a variety of enemies
that you will encounter along
your adventure. They all have
the same goal in mind - to stop
you at all costs. Here is
listing of every enemy
encountered in the game. Most
enemies have a variance of
sorts, that is, they have
different or altered physical
forms.

Drone: The standard enemy of the
game. These levitating nuisances
are not very tough alone, but if
they get the opportunity to gang
up on you, life might become a
little more difficult. All of
their forms go down with
relative ease.

Crawlers: Tiny metallic enemies
that are commonly found in
narrow hallways and tunnels
where you send the Remote Access
Droid into. They have no long
range attacks at all, they
literally have to crawl to you
in order to harm you. Even
against the Remote Access Droid
they do not pose much of a
threat against you.

Gun TurretS: Mounted on either
ceilings or the side of walls.
The standard variety shoot blue
lasers at Kane, there is also a
red form that shoots a kind of
homing yellow plasma projectile
at you. Best to attack from long
range if at all possible. They
are not really too much of a
threat by themselves, it is just
when they overwhelm you in
superior numbers things can get
heated.

Spiders: Small compact
mechanical beasts that shoot
projectiles in all possible
directions. Their core is the
weak point. The only difference
between the two varities comes
in how durable they are and how
fast the projectiles are fired.
The blue advanced model fires
much more rapidly than the first
yellow models you come across.

Scorpion: You realy don't see
too many of these, in fact one
of them serves as the first boss
of the game, and then you won't
come across them until much
later in the game. Fires a
projectile from its tail that
can both stun you and deplete
your health meter. Somewhat
durable to your Super Assault
Rifle. They also utilize a
shockwave-type of attack by
raising up and slamming down on
the ground.

Walking Mech Suits: Not having
an official name for most
enemies in the game leaves
things very open for
interpretation, as you can see.
These enemies are exactly what
the name implies - walking mechs
that fire green projectiles at
you. When they are destroyed
sometimes a smaller flying enemy
will try to crash into Kane,
causing harm. These foes are
also fairly tough and most of
the time you will want to use
better weaponry than your Super
Assault Rifle against them and
their several different forms,
such as the ones that launch
grenades at Kane.

Roller-Bosses: Mini-bosses that
also show up as regular enemies
towards the end of the game.
Their weak point is their
center. Roll towards Kane in an
attempt to crush him, and they
also have the ability to fire
from their dual laser blasters.
Targeting their center with your
best weaponry will put them away
quickly though.

Mechanized Doors: At the end of
most non-boss levels you will
have to face an automated
defense...door. Yeah, it really
IS a door. They fire flare
projectile at you. Their weak
point is their orange-glowing
center. They serve as a type of
sub-boss, a very easy sub-boss
at that.

Bosses: Almost every other
Episode will be a boss fight
Episode. Every boss has a
specific routine and attack
pattern, and the boss fights
that require you to interact
with whats around you is all
pretty straightforward. Each
boss is different except for the
first three Guardian fights, its
basically the same fight except
with different conditions in
place. Same goes for the
numerous core bosses you will
fight. Thankfully every boss
fight is extremely easy and
straightforward.


--------------------------------
 VII. Walkthrough  [wlk00]
--------------------------------

The meat and bones of the FAQ
itself. I will outline the guide
portion just as the game does,
by episode title. I will try to
make this guide as spoiler free
as I possibly can, I understand
that reading spoilers while
you're looking for help is
pretty annoying. But I make no
absolute promises. I may mention
a small scene or something, but
big plot points will never be
talked about, that I do promise.

--------------------------------
 Prologue [pro0]
--------------------------------

At the start of adventure, take
a few moments to get yourself
situated with the controls, and
get used to the stylus use, you
will not get very far in the
game if you don't. Take a quick
walk around, and then hop on the
catwalk. Using your map, find
your way to the end of it.
Approach the yellow blinking
spot, and using the Touch
Screen, tap on the "Open"
command to progress to the next
room.

The first room you enter will be
pretty uneventful, so open the
door to the next room. The door
on the left is locked, leaving
you with only one other door to
go through. Open the door, and
view the scene that plays.

After that scene things seem to
heat up a bit. Directly in front
of you will be the SUPER
ASSSAULT RIFLE (simply
abbreviated to "SAR"). Tap
"Take" on the Touch screen to
acquire it. Aww yeah, no ammo
needed. On the default control
scheme (Type 1) the shoot button
will be the L button. Since
there is no way to go but from
where you came, exit out the
single door. In the next area,
shoot the alien that is floating
directly in front of you. One
burst from your Super Assault
Rifle will take care of
business. Continue on to the
left, you can't miss the path,
you'll notice the broken door
and the bodies of some of your
teammates.

Shoot the aliens that you come
across. Do your best to avoid
their projectile shots, I only
got hit once but that was
because of bad reflex. Continue
down the narrow hallway,
shooting whatever you come
across. Keep straight and soon
you'll come across a shiny blue
object on the ground. Walk to it
as if you were going to pick it
up. A strange scene will ensure.
After the scene you'll speak
with both General Lambert and
Captain Tsukigam. They don't
quite know what it was, but
evidently it helped you, yay!
After that exchange is finished,
go straight out the door in
front of you - the other door
farther back on the right is
locked. You will again find
yourself on the surface of the
moon, outside of the base.

Examine the corpses scattered
throughout the first part of the
area. Kane suggests that three
soldiers are missing in action,
and possibly still alive. You
receive orders to enter the
subterranean portion of the
level to play a little recon.
There is not much else to do
right now, so enter the
mysterious green portal to be
taken deeper into the Moon. End
of the prologue.

--------------------------------
 Episode 01: Product Storage Sec
--------------------------------

At the start of the Episode,
descend the stairs and make your
way into the main area. Off to
the first right is where you
want (and can) go. Examine the
blue canister on the ground,
this will trigger a scene. When
the scene is finished, move back
a little so as to give you a
more advantageous position
against the attacking drone
robot enemies. After you have
dispatched all three of them,
the door allowing you to advance
more will unlock. Go through it.

Examine the computer terminal
directly in front of you to
trigger some more dialogue and
advance the plot. That terminal
is your first taste of the Map
Terminals that are found in the
game. You now have a map of a
good chunk of the area. You are
given more orders to check it
out. Head through the door that
is beyond the Map Terminal. In
the next room you are given
instructions to use the save
point. You really have no
choice, as the door you need to
go through will not be unlocked
until after you do so.

More of those floating drones
will assault you as soon as you
enter the next room, just dodge
their blasts and take them out.
From the entrance point, make
your way left. Destroy the
drones that you come across. You
should find yourself in an area
which you can use the Remote
Assistance Droid. Make a note of
this and continue further. A
single drone will be all that
there is between you and the
next area. In this area there
will again be enemies to
dispatch as soon as you're in.
To the right is a hallway with a
door, but of course it is
guarded by drones. Make short
work of them and continue along.

There is not anything too
eventful about this narrow
winding hallway, except for the
CRAWLING METAL INSECT ROBOTS!
Yeah, this is your first
encounter with them. There
really is not much to say about
them. They cannot hurt you
unless they touch you. Shoot
them as they crawl to you.
They're more of a nuisance for
the Remote Assistance Droid than
anything. Continue on.

The first thing you will
probably notice in this area is
that giant orange force field.
There is not much Kane can do
about it, you have to disable
the Force Orbs that power it. To
your left is an area blocked off
by a bunch of boxes that block
Kane's path. Which leaves you
with one option - going to the
right. In the next area, drop
down to the left. You will get
more dialogue with Kane and
Tsuke, then take the Remote
Assistance Droid. Use it to
blast the vent shield and then
go through the vent with your
new RAD. This is also an intro
to the many puzzles you will
solve with the Remote Assistance
Droid. When you reach the end of
the tunnel, use the EMP blast to
disable the force field on the
next vent you come across. Then
blast the Force Orb with to
allow Kane his access. Switch to
Kane (via the weapon select
screen on the Touch Screen) and
walk Kane past where the force
field generates. Take the RAD,
and make your way up the stairs.
Shoot the two Force Orbs
yourself, and exit out the way
you came here.

Remember that spot I told you to
make a mental note of? Go back
to it. Use the RAD to enter
through the vent. Once you're in
the small room, go in the other
vent. You will eventually make
your way to the first Alien
Artififact! Collect the other
two and you will unlock a bonus
episode that can be played! Go
back to where you saw your first
force field.

Stand in front of the force
field, and use the Touch Screen
to select the Remote Access
Droid. Move the little thing
down the path to the left. If
you did not take care of the
metal crawling robot be sure to
watch out for that annoying
little bugger. When you make
your way past the linear path
with all of the containers use
your map and make it over to the
southeast side of the room.
Blast open the security vents
and crawl through the system.
After a few twists and turns you
will make your way to the second
Alien Artifact in the episode,
yay! Backtrack all of the way
through the vents.

This time go up the steps that
you haven't gone up yet (of
course!), being sure to avoid
the mechanical monsters that are
around you. Blasting them with
your EMP is typically a waste of
time if you ask me. When you are
in range, shoot the single force
orb to disable the force field.
Switch back to Kane, pick up the
RAD, and go through the door to
the next area.

It's more or less the same deal
here. Take the time to destroy
the two drones that are in the
area where your RAD will be
crawling around, just to make
your life a little easier.
Before you send out the RAD,
move Kane in a corner where he
is out of the range of fire.
There is a drone on the other
side of the force field that can
shoot at you, but you cannot
shoot at it for now. Anyway,
move the RAD down the steps to
the right, around the containers
in your way, and up the steps
that lead to the space behind
the force field. Disable the
force orbs quickly and switch to
Kane, there will be two drones
shooting at your RAD. Make short
work of them, pick up your
robot, and then continue on
through the door.

This area is pretty much the
same as before. Do your best to
make sure Kane is out of the
way, and move your RAD down the
left path (as if you had any
other choice really), dodge past
the red drones and their
firepower, and haul robot butt
up the steps. Disable all of the
force orbs to deactivate the
force field, do the whole
switching-to-Kane routine, pick
up the RAD, and head out.

Now, dispatch the two metallic
crawlers before sending the RAD
through the vents. When you are
out, disable the single force
orb. Switch to Kane, grab the
RAD, and enter the room. It
contains a MAX HEALTH INCREASE
which will increase Kane's
health meter, yay! After you get
that, go out the way you came,
and go through the door. There
are no enemies in this next
room, make your way over to the
downed soldier to start some
more dialogue. Since there are
only two other doors in the
room, and one of them is locked,
your options are pretty limited
for now. Go through the other
door that is not locked. You
will find yourself in a save
room. Use it to save your
progress and replenish any
damage you may have suffered,
then move along.

There is a new type of enemy
that is ahead of you. Honestly,
I am just going to call it a
spider. There are no official
names given for any of the
enemies you come across in the
game, so literally ANYTHING
works. But yeah, when it comes
to those spiders, all you have
to keep in mind is this: shoot
their yellow core when they
expose it (they expose it as
they shoot off their projectiles
at you) until it is destroyed.
Simple enough. Be careful
though, in the two rooms next to
where you enter the area there
are two drones that will double
team you. So if you have the
spider as well as the two drones
on your butt, you won't last too
long. Dispatch the lot of them
and exit through the south door.
Right when you enter the next
area a drone will open fire, so
be aware. Turns out, this small
square room is just full of
drones. Destroy them all and
keep moving.

In this room you immediately
notice the giant blue force
field blocking the path. All you
have to do is shut it down by
examining the few yellow power
terminals that are around it.
First things first though, get
rid of those pesky drones. After
the force field is shut down you
are free to claim the Muon
Pistol. Continue through the
door just beyond where you
acquired the new gun. The next
room is a save area. The one
after that is much more
interesting.

Ah, your first boss fight. You
have to destroy the giant metal
monstrosity as well as look out
for the drone. Even if you
destroy the drone that is with
it, another will simply spawn.
This is both good and bad. It's
bad because you will always have
tha extra enemy. But the good
news is, destroyed drones drop
ammo and health canisters to
pick up. As for the actual fight
itself, the boss will stalk you.
There is no point in running
away. In order to damage bosses
in this game, you have to shoot
the red areas on their body. In
this case, shooting the entire
body of the boss will damage it,
but this doesn't happen too
often so don't get used to it.

The Muon Pistol deals more
damage than your Super Assault
Rifle. The projectile launched
from the boss' tail both damages
Kane and in some instances, can
temporarily stun him, making it
very difficult for you to move.
Just keep up with shooting the
drones as they become an issue,
and focus on getting in as many
hits on the boss as you can.
Sooner than later, you'll have
it bested. Claim the Red Key,
then make your way over to the
east side of the chamber. Send
in the Remote Access Droid,
disable the orbs and claim the
Ammo Clip to give your new Muon
Pistol more capability! Now you
have to backtrack a very far
amount of distance, back to
where you found the dead
private. Use your new Red Key to
unlock the door and continue
along.

 Episode 01: Product Storage Sec
--------------------------------

I split this section because
it's so darn huge. Really, the
second level of the game is
massive. And since the game
doesn't shorten up, expect me to
halve certain episodes, just for
cosmetic purposes

There are no enemies in this red
hallway. In the next room you
will see another map terminal.
Examine it to trigger some more
dialogue and to download more of
the area. The next room presents
you with another Remote Access
Droid puzzle. Send it through
the right path first, eventually
you will come across the third
and final Alien Artifact of the
Episode, yay! You unlocked a
bonus episode to play! But
anywho, backtrack to where Kane
is and go through the other
vent. Be sure to either avoid
the crawlers or stun them. The
force orb you need to stun is in
the same room with the gun
turrets mounted on the ceiling.
Disable it and move the RAD to a
safe spot. Then bring Kane in,
destroy the gun turrets and pick
up you RAD. Then make your way
to the west side of the chamber
and exit through the door.

Aside from the strange nature of
this area, there is nothing too
challenging about it. Destroy
the drones and gun turrets you
come across, and move to the
next door. The next room is the
same case, be careful to not get
surrounded though, those turrets
can sneak up on you and coupled
with the drones, they're a
regular pain in the butt. Keep
moving along. Watch out for the
room after that one though, two
drones will spawn from the
security vent behind you, but
not until after you walk past
it. Wrap around either side and
continue through the door.

The next room is more annoying
than anything. Clear the two
turrets as well as the two
spiders, and move on. In the
next red hallway keep moving
straight, the room at the end
contains another MAX HEALTH
INCREASE for you to pick up.
From there backtrack and hook a
right to the only other
direction you can go. This is
more annoying than anything. In
this next room you have to
destroy the mechanical guard on
the door. It shoots fireballs at
you, or something. All you have
to do is shoot its core, it'll
flash red when it takes damage.
Move back and forth to get it to
expose the core. I advise use of
the Muon Pistol just to make the
process happen faster. Three
shots will do the trick. You
will see a scene of it
exploding, and then that will
bring this Episode to a close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 02: Guardian I [ep202]
--------------------------------

Pick up the key in front of you
and continue straight ahead.
Watch the scene that unfolds,
and get ready for your second
boss fight! This one is just as
easy as simple and
straightforward as the first one
though. As soon as the fight
starts, pop a few rounds into
the glowing red areas on its
lower chest. If its entire body
flashes red, it means you have
successuflly connected! Be sure
to make good use of the cover
the four pillars surrounding the
boss give Kane. The boss itself
cannot leave its confined area,
so standing just in front of
those pillars will keep you safe
enough. When you expose yourself
to take your shots at the boss,
be sure to move quick. The old
rule of never standing still in
one spot for too long in video
games holds true. If you stand
in one place, or just are too
slow to dodge the boss'
projectile attacks, Kane will
take damage.

As the battle looms in and the
boss takes more damage, it will
begin to fire more projectiles
at Kane at once. Also, it will
summon Drones to dispatch you.
As soon as they are summoned,
take the time to destroy them.
Not only will you be saving
yourself from their nuisance,
but they may also drop health
canisters as well as ammunition
pickups. The Muon Pistol is a
very effective weapon in this
fight, if your accuracy is good
enough to hit a red zone on the
boss it will deal greater damage
than rounds from your Super
Assault Rifle. The trick to this
fight is dodging the projectile
attacks and taking your shots
when you can, and also
dispatching those annoying
Drones when the boss summons
them.

--------------------------------
 Episode 03: Escape Product Stor
--------------------------------

Ugh, do I despise timer
missiions. Your objective is
simple, escape from the Product
Storage Sector within ninety
seconds. Do not try to leave out
the way you came, instead exit
out of the door that is up the
ramp in the boss room. After
this, the rest is simply a mad
dash out of the place. Do not
attempt to destroy every enemy
that you come across, merely the
ones that are in your immediate
path. When you reach the room
that has you dropping down from
a much higher point, exit out
the door to the right of the Map
Terminal. At this new point it
is just a matter of backtracking
through familiar territory. Go
up to the stairs that lead to
the elevator that took you into
this place originally.

You get some praise from Tsuke
for making it out alive. Now
again, it is just a simple
matter of backtracking through
an area you are already familiar
with. If you recall the base
area from the Prologue level,
just do everything you did there
backwards. When you first enter
the area one of those pesky
little metal crawling enemies
will greet you. Give it a burst
from your Super Assault Rifle.
Continue along the hallway, you
will open two doors before
finding yourself in a new area.
Shoot the two metal crawlers and
go down the stairs, to the right
is a door. Go through it and
shoot the two red drones that
you will encounter right away.
Open the door in the middle of
the room and continue through
the other door. Congratulations,
you successfully escaped!

Lambert and Tsukigami will fll
you in one some more plot
points, and then you are given
orders to explore another alien
hatch. Pick up the Explosives
that are sitting on the counter
in front of you, then use your
Navigational Display to find the
LOLA. Use the Action Icon to
enter it, watch the cool scene,
and leave the base area. From
here it is just following the
yellow and black striped path,
with some drone and turret
shooting in the max. When you
reach toward the end of the
path, the blue icon on your
navigational display will flash
toward the west. Exit out of the
LOLA and walk past the black and
yellow striped columns with the
red triangle-like shapes at
their top. Continue north and
eventually you will see a scene
with Kane placing the explosives
on the rocks and running away to
a safe distance as they
detonate. After the explosion
merely walk over to the newly
exposed hatch, and once you walk
directly to it Kane will descend
into this new mysterious hatch.
This brings Episode 03 to a
close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 04: Product Storage Sec
--------------------------------

Descend the stairs and pass
through the door to enter the
room with the map terminal you
want. More dialogue will pop up,
and then you're on your way.
Past the save room will be an
area with steps to descend.
Examine the terminal in the
middle for some more dialogue
and a clue as to what to do
next. You are told to explore
two diferent paths in hopes of
unlocking some type of security
which will let you advance. It
does not matter which path you
take first, the east or west
one.

I personally started with the
east one. There isn't anything
too special about the first
hallway you're in, just dispatch
the numerous crawlers you come
across and you'll be alright.
When you get to the vent, send
out your Remote Access Droid and
make your way through the
system. You will soon come
across another vent to explore,
at the end of that one will be
an Alien Artifact! Once you have
claimed it, backtrack all of the
way to where Kane is and
continue on.

The next area isn't too special,
it's just a winding path with
drones and those pesky spider
things to destroy. As you have
probably noticed by now, the red
colored drones are a pure pain
in the rear. The chamber that
contains what you are looking
for is pretty straightforward,
just follow your on-screen map.
The only thing you really have
to watch out for is getting
overun by all of the enemies.
There are turrets, spiders, and
plenty of drones for you to take
on, yay. Claim the Missing Piece
from the pedestal and head back
the way you came in.

The west path is unnecessarily
harder than the east path, but
it is still very manageable.
Right from the get-go you're
faced with an RAD puzzle, get
those to these, they're
everywhere in this game and both
in the west path. Send the RAD
under the pipes and down the
level. Use your map, when you
come to the first left, go into
it. You should see another Alien
Artifact. Collect it, and then
to the left and right of where
you picked up the Artifact will
be the two force orbs that you
need to disable in order to get
Kane through the force field. Do
this, then switch to Kane and
bring him closer to the entrance
of the vent system that your RAD
entered, and switch back to it
so that you can get to Kane and
reunite! After you do this, keep
moving into the next area.

This area is more annoying than
anything. Make your way past the
weird machines and stop when you
get to the vent. Send out your
RAD, and when you enter the open
area with the indestructible gun
turrets (trust me, you cannot
destroy them, I spent a few
minutes pumping hot lead into
them and cursing) and blast the
two force orbs on the ceiling.
Now move Kane past where the
force field will generate, and
switch back to the RAD. Go
through the next vent, come out
and blast the two force orbs.
Switch to Kane and make a mad
dash for the door. Then move the
RAD over to Kane so you can
retrieve it, and continue on
through the door.

Ugh, this is seriously probably
my most hated area of the entire
game, just because of how
tedious it is. But anyway, with
a force field to your left you
have little choice but to send
out the Remote Access Droid to
the right, down the stairs and
under the pipes. Be wary of the
drones and gun turret, they will
always be gunning for you. As
soon as you descend the stairs,
hook a left into the room with
the force orb you need to blast
with your trusted EMP. When you
accomplish this, switch to Kane
and get him through where the
force field was and down the
steps. Now, as far as the RAD is
concerned, instead of backtrack-
ing up the stairs and whatnot,
just use your map and guide it
to where Kane is. This will
serve as a nifty shortcut and it
will give you a nice idea of the
layout.

When you get your bearings
straight, take the RAD into the
chamber with the Missing Piece,
and have it go into the vent.
You will see yet another Alien
Artifact. If you have been
following the same paths in the
order I laid out in this guide,
that is the third and final
piece. If not, you still have
one more to obtain in the east
path. When you are done with
that, travel under the next
batch of pipes, and to the right
will be the room with the right
force orb to disable. Deactivate
it, and then take Kane down the
steps through the rest of the
hallway. Make your way into the
chamber and claim the second
Missing Piece (or first). Now it
is the ultimate fun task of
backtracking through the entire
west path. First move Kane to
the force field, then have the
RAD disable it. After you have
done this twice you will be able
to leave. In the room where you
twice sent the RAD to disable
the force orbs, just shoot them
as Kane to make things happen
fast. Yeah, you probably will
take damage, but you will be
able to easily recover it. You
will have to send the RAD in the
middle vent system to disable
the force field blocking Kane,
then go up the left path under
the pipes to meet him again. Go
back to where you were told to
explore the two paths.

Examine the terminal to assemble
the two pieces. As it turns out,
that was all along a weapon.
Take the Quanta Rifle. The door
beyond is still unlocked for
you. When you are ready, head
through it to explore the next
part of this area.

--------------------------------
 Episode 04: Product Storage Sec
--------------------------------

As soon as you enter the room,
you are greeted with an entire
platoon of foes to destroy. Get
the gun turrets on the ceiling
first, then dispose of all the
drones, and then the spider
enemy. After this you are faced
with two options as far as
exploration is concerned, it
does not matter which path you
take really. I personally had to
explore both because what little
obsessive compulsive disorder I
have wouldn't let me just
explore one path and leave the
other one blue and unexplored.
If it helps you decide, the
right path has two spiders to
deal with whereas the left path
only has drones.

When you make your way into the
main chamber you're given more
dialogue. Head through the only
door in the room afterwards. In
the next room you will drop down
into an area with another one of
those mechanized door locks to
destroy. Again, your Muon Pistol
makes the whole affair VERY
short. I'd personally conserve
Quanta Rifle ammo for now,
unless you happened to pick some
more up. After it is destroyed
this will bring Episode 04 to a
close.

--------------------------------
 ++ffmasterjose's anti-plagiaris

--------------------------------
 Episode 05: Sanctus Vector [ep5
--------------------------------

Pick up the Red Key lying in
front of you, there really isn't
any other option given that it
is in the middle of the doorway,
but hey. Past the door into the
next chamber is your first
"serious" boss fight. It may
prove tough for first time
players, but once you figure out
what to do, it's a cinch.

You will notice the boss is
behind a giant orange force
field, and on both sides of the
room are vents to send your
Remote Access Droid in. It
doesn't matter which one you
choose really. When you come
out, there are four force orbs
to disable with your EMP blast.
Move quickly, if you can take
long range shots at them. When
all four are disabled and the
force field is finally down, the
boss itself will move down the
steps towards Kane.

Notice the flashing red spots on
its body, these are of course
the boss' weak points. The
objective is to shoot all of
them to render them disabled,
then when the boss' red core is
exposed, to open fire on it. It
has two main forms of attacking
Kane. The first involves just
launching projectiles in a full
circle around itself, in the
same fashion as those pesky
spider enemies. And its other
attack is a red laser that emits
from its bottom. This can also
be avoided, though it is a
little more tricky than the
projectile attack. I say to use
the Super Assault Rifle or the
Muon Pistol for the numerous
weak points along the body, then
when the core is exposed to
switch to the Quanta Rifle and
open fire.

When the core is exposed drones
will be summoned. Just do your
best to ignore them. You only
have so much time to shoot the
core before the boss goes behind
the force field again. If this
happens, you'll have to use the
Remote Access Droid to disable
the force orbs again, and as you
are doing this the boss will
renegerate its health, putting
you back to square one when it
comes down again. The vital
thing to do is unleash your new
Quanta Rifle on the core, it
will not last too long once you
do this. Even if you do not
manage to destroy the boss the
first time, the leftovers from
the drones it summons may give
you some health canisters to
pick up as well as some more
ammo for your Quanta Rifle and
Muon Pistol. You will take
damage by focusing everything on
the exposed core, so act fast.
Really, all this battle is is
just a matter of good timing.
When the boss is destroyed
Episode 05 will come to a close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 06: Exit Product Storag
--------------------------------

This would be another level that
I hate, and that's because it's
time based. Exit out of the boss
chamber and instead of
backtracking through familiar
territory hook a right and exit
through the door there that was
previously locked. You'll get
some more dialogue to advance
the plot, and then you are told
to continue further. In the
first area you find yourself in,
just shoot and run. It makes
things go much faster, and there
is nothing extra for you to
collect in this Episode. The
next area is a twisting linear
path full of those metal crawler
enemies.

The next area will be the main
chamber where you picked up the
Quanta Rifle, you'll drop down.
Destroy the two drones, then
start backtracking through the
familiar territory, and be sure
to save your progress when you
hit the save room. Eventually
you will find yourself in the
area with the alien elevator,
make short work of the two red
drones and then catch a ride
back top to the surface. Then
make your way back to the LOLA.
Take the LOLA into the hanger
area directly in front of where
you parked it, keep going until
you're at the end onto the
platform. Once you're on it the
game will automatically save and
you'll be taken up the lift.

Here's where the poop hits the
fan. Through more storyline
dialogue you are told that you
only have two more minutes to
get over to the last satellite
before it's too late! Now your
LOLA's navigational display
comes in handy. Fortunately,
your goal is hard to miss - it's
a satellite after all! The first
part is very linear, its just a
straight, twisting path. Don't
spend too much time shooting the
drones and turrets. Avoid the
landmines as best you can, I
understand that the steering is
very sluggish with the LOLA. You
will soon find your way to
another platform that will take
the LOLA up to the next level.

The clock is still ticking, so
don't take your foot off the gas
just yet. Again, the path is
very straightforward. Just keep
twisting around, doing your best
to shoot the drones and turrets
and avoid all of those
landmines. When you come to a
fork in the path, go right, as
indicated by your navigational
display. You'll see the
satellite. Park next to it, and
then exit. It takes literally
eight seconds for Kane to exit
out of that damn vehicle, so
make sure you have at least 15
to kill when you arrive. Then
walk up to the console on the
satellite, Examine it to save
the day and end the timer.

But a hero's work is truly never
finished. After you do that, you
are given some more orders.
Simply hop in the LOLA and head
down that left path from the
fork in the road. And once again
you have the comfort of
following a very linear path.
Make your way to the platform
with the LOLA, you'll see a
scene and be taken to a new part
of the area. This last part is
the same as the previous
sections, just be sure to keep
to the right. Eventually you'll
get to a point in the area where
it will cut to a scene and the
Episode will draw to a close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 07: Non-ETO Transport V
--------------------------------

This is actually a fairly short
level that has a very
straightforward layout, the only
difficulty that you might
encounter with it is the very
last part of the level, which
sees you fighting a boss of some
sort. Here you are introduced to
a new type of enemy, the walking
suit aliens. These are more
formidable and they fire more
damaging projectiles at you.
Your Muon Pistol and Quantra
Rifle still make short work of
them though. Occasionally when
you destory them, a small drone
will emerge from the destruction
and zoom towards you, going for
a kamikaze-type move. If it hits
you, you'll take damage. So when
you see one, just shoot it.

Make your way past the first
couple of walking robots,
picking up any ammo that they
drop. You will wrap around some
more and come across two more.
Then you will follow the path as
it takes you deeper and deeper
into the alien spacecaft. Shoot
down the drones and the walking
suits you come across. Soon
after this you will notice a
boss life gauge pop up on the
top of the screen. Well as it
turns out, the boss is just a
core you have to disable, but it
does take some work on your part
to accomplish.

The core at first is spinning
with panels on each side. It
emits grenades to keep you at a
constant distance, and
projectile shots that mimic
those the spider enemies shoot.
What you must do at first is
target the circular spots above
each panel, not the area where
the projectiles are fired from,
but above that. It's fairly
small and somewhat difficult to
shoot from far away. I advise
use of the Muon Pistol. If you
can get an accurate shot in
while the panels are moving, it
won't take but a few rounds
compared to that of your Super
Assault Rifle. If a panel
flashes red, it means you are
doing damage. After you have
taken out all four of the panels
the main core is exposed. Now
you should pull out the Quanta
Rifle and unleash on the core
with it. The core will fire
lasers in the same manner as the
last boss did, they are easy to
dodge. In fact you can probably
stand from a good distance and
unleash on it without worrying
about the lasers.

When it is finally destroyed you
will see a cool cut scene, and
the Episode will be drawn to a
close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 08: LOLA-RR10 / Waste D
--------------------------------

You begin in the LOLA. At first
there really isn't anywhere to
go, the path is very linear and
without much surprise. When you
come to the fork in the road it
really doesn't matter which way
you take, both will bring you to
the exact same spot. Keep your
eye on the navigational map.
Soon you will come to an opening
with two red drones. Dispatch of
them, and then look for an
opening in the rocks. Beyond
this opening is another hatch
for you to explore. Descend the
elevator to get things moving.

Examine the map terminal to
download the schematics for the
area, pay attention to the
dialogue, and make your mind up
as far as which way you are
going to go first. For our
purposes, I'm starting with the
northwest area first.

There really isn't anything of
real interest in the first
couple of rooms, just some
drones to shoot and some
dialogue to read. The second
room has a spider enemy waiting
for you. In the next area hook a
left, you will see some more
plot advancement, and then you
will have the chance to keep
exploring. Just head through the
first door you see. This next
area is an ambush, and you are
unfortunately at a disadvantage.
Get out of the center of the
room, head towards the stairs,
dispath the first walking mech
you see, then shoot the drone in
the stairway. There are two more
suits for you to destroy. When
you have taken care of that
business, continue on into the
next room.

This is the first core boss of
three that you have to take care
of, and all of them are pretty
much the same. Just like the
last core they emit projectile
shots and lob out grenades. If
you are in any of the rooms
where the grenades explode, you
will feel the blast radius. What
you have to do is do your best
to avoid the projectile shots,
and then use your Muon Pistol to
take shots at the vulnerable
point just above its cannons, it
is essentially the same boss
fight as before when you were on
the alien ship. One good shot or
two should take care of each
panel. When the core is exposed
it will emit lasers, but you
already know this game. Use your
Quanta Rifle until the core is
destroyed. Exit out of the
previously locked door, and use
the save point to save your
progress as well as restore your
lost health. Continue on.

The next area is simple,
dispatch the two red drones and
then send your Remote Access
Droid through the simple vent
puzzle. Disable the force field,
and claim the AMMO CLIP INCREASE
for the Quanta Rifle. Leave this
room and exit down the hallway
and out through the next door.
Destroy the walking mech in
front of where you enter, as
well as the numerous annoying
drones. Exit through the only
door in the room. The room after
that has nothing of interest
either, so just get to the door.

Before you send your RAD down,
take the time to clear the
spider enemy and the drone. When
you send it out, make it go
under the pipes instead of the
vent first, so you can disable
the first force field and get
Kane past it. Then send it
through the vents, when you come
out the two force orbs will be
in clear view. Destroy the red
drones and keep moving. This
area presents you with yet
another RAD puzzle. Send the
robot out under the pipes, avoid
or stun the drone and get into
the vents. The first space you
make it into has the two force
orbs on the ceiling, but if you
continue into the vents, you
will find an Alien Artifact! Go
back to the open area, disable
the orbs, get Kane through the
force field and into the next
area.

There's not much to say about
his place, its just linear
twisting and turning with some
drones thrown into the mix. You
will then find yourself in the
next core chamber. Follow the
same tactic that you did for the
first room. The only difference
comes in the drones and spider
enemies that are now present in
the rooms. Be sure to take care
of them first, just to make your
life easier and in case they
drop health canisters and ammo
pickups. Use the exact same
tactic for when the core is
exposed. When you have succeeded
you will be treated to another
cutscene, and the chance to save
your game and restore your
health in the next save room.

--------------------------------
 Episode 08: LOLA-RR10 / Waste D
--------------------------------

More narrow tunnels await you,
coupled with an easy Remote
Access Droid puzzle to solve.
When you can use Kane again, get
rid of the drones and crawlers
fast, as they will only serve to
annoy you. Before you leave,
take the time to check out the
isolated room (use your map if
you're confused), in this room
you will find a MAX HEALTH
INCREASE. Exit through either of
the two doors, it doesn't matter
which one you take as they both
lead to the exact same place.
Wherever you come out you'll
have to deal with drones. After
doing this, continue on through
the door. Yay, another RAD
puzzle! Send the little bugger
out, make your way to the force
orbs. Disable them and bring
Kane in, pick up your droid and
blast the drones to dust. Keep
moving.

Simple but noteworthy area.
Follow the linear path,
destroying the mechs as you go
along. Then in the last chamber
with the door you'll want to
send out your RAD to pick up the
Alien Artifact! Exit through the
door. On this catwalk of sorts
you will want to be very
careful. When there is an
opening on either side of Kane
are gun turrets. Destroy them,
and then destroy the drones that
you come across. The next room
is the chamber with the third
and final core to take care of.

You will want to employ the same
strategy as before with the
first two cores. If anything
this core is actually the
easiest of them all, given that
you have much more room to move
around. In fact, you can even
stand far back enough out of
firing range on one of the
sides. When the core is exposed
you know what to do. Exit out,
you will find yourself back in
the main chamber. Ascend the
stairs and make your way into
the area that was previous
inaccessible to you. Go through
the door, you will encounter yet
another mechanized door to deal
with. When it is defeated, that
will be all she wrote for
Episode 08.

--------------------------------

 Episode 09: Guardian II [ep909]
--------------------------------


This is very similiar to the
first Guardian boss fight. There
are a few note- worthy
differences though. Along with
projectile fire the boss will
also toss out grenades at you,
making it so you want to stay on
the move and not be too
stationary throughout the fight.
You also have to disable the
four force field generators,
otherwise you won't even be able
to damage the boss.

Just go around and examine the
generators to turn them off.
Then when you can finally strike
the Guardian, use your Muon
Pistol to blast the three red
panels on its body. When these
are taken out, it will expose
the core. When this happens
switch to the Quanta Rifle and
unload everything you have on
it. You may not take the boss
out in one shot, so don't worry
if the force field pops back up.
It doesn't regenerate health or
anything, so simply deactivate
the force field again and repeat
the process. Soon enough victory
will be yours to claim and
Episode 09 will be finished.

--------------------------------
 Episode 10: Power Station [ep10
--------------------------------

Exit out of the new door,
descend the stairs and pick up
the Fermon Sniper off the
pedestal, and continue on. The
next room has nothing except for
a walking mech suit to destroy
and a door to go through. Save
your game in the save room and
continue on. This main chamber
has for doors leading to
different locations as well as
one extra door, but you cannot
enter that without exploring the
other four rooms and getting the
necessary security key/code. I
start from the northwest room
and work my way counter-
clockwise, so that's how I am
going to lay out this part of
the guide.

The first room has nothing of
interest. The second has a
chamber with another RAD puzzle,
but before you send out your
robot be sure to take care of
the mech or it will get the drop
on Kane. Controlling the Remote
Access Droid, once you are out
of the tunnel hook a right past
the two walking mechs, disable
the ground turret and to the
left of the turret is an Alien
Artifact for you to claim.
Backtrack back to Kane and
continue on. The next area is
still pretty simple. At the
start, take out the spider. Then
move into the chamber it was at
and bust out your Fermon Sniper,
then take aim at the grenade-
throwing enemy, one shot should
do the trick. Move to where it
was located, and send your RAD
under the pipes. Move around,
past the mech and you will soon
come across the force orbs.
Blast them with your EMP and
move Kane through. Don't bother
with the walking suit mech, just
exit out the door.

There is nothing of interest in
this winding tunnel, just a few
annoying crawler enemies. In the
next room however, you have
force fields on either side of
Kane to deal with. Send out the
RAD under the pipes and down the
steps. Go on either the left or
right side, it doesn't matter
which, and disable the force
field so that Kane can progress
further. Whichever way you took,
pick up the RAD and make your
way to the main hallway and
through the door. In the save
room grab the key and save your
game. The next chamber presents
the first out of four minibosses
that are all the same.

The boss' vulnerable point is
its center. It fires from two
sides, one side fires
projectiles that harm you, while
another fires projectiles that
can stun you. And the boss will
always be trying to roll into
you, causing more harm. The key
is to keep moving and
specifically target its middle
section. If you make a good,
connecting hit, it will flash
red indicating to you that you
have done the right thing. These
fights typically won't last
long. When the boss is
destroyed, pick up the Data
Packet. When you have it,
backtrack all of the way back to
main chamber with the four
doors. Now I will cover the
southwest path.

Past the small and pointless
twisting narrow hallway is a
more expansive area with more to
do. When you first enter the
area keep straight, down the
stairs will be a MAX HEALTH
INCREASE for you to take, but it
is guarded. Dispose of the
drones, and then send out the
RAD in the vent. At the end will
be another Alien Artifact to
claim, then get back to Kane. Go
back upstairs and down the
catwalk, shooting the drones as
you go along into the next area.
This area has nothing of
interest, just make it to the
door.

This next area is a mess.
Destroy as many drones as you
possibly can, then take out the
grenade launching turret. Send
out the Remote Access Droid
under the pipes where the turret
was. Then disable the first set
of orbs to let Kane in, then
using Kane shoot the other two
that he can access to retrieve
your droid. walk up the steps
and past the catwalk and go
through the door. This area is
noteworthy for intoducing you to
a new enemy, the exploding cube!
Either get close enough to it,
or shoot it. It will explode and
send out a shockwave that hurts
Kane. Continue past this
twisting hallway.

The next room is a save room.
Take the key, then heal and
save. You have to face another
roller boss, but it's the exact
same fight. I discovered a
really funny "bug" of sorts. If
you get right up in the boss'
face, it will constantly ram
toward you, but not hurt you.
Its lasers can't touch you
either. Really, you can just
stand right in front of it and
fire away. After it is easily
taken down, pick up the data
packet and backtrack all of the
way to the center room.

--------------------------------
 ++ffmasterjose's anti-plagiaris

--------------------------------
 Episode 10: Power Station (Part
--------------------------------

Now we will explore the
southeast region. The first room
has nothing but red drones for
you to destroy. The next has a
very simple Remote Access Droid
puzzle to solve. Put Kane on the
east side of the level next to
the force field and then send
out the robot through the vent.
The force orbs are right near
where the droid will come out.
Get Kane and your drone back
together, then go through the
door. The next area is a giant
circle with walking mech suits
and drones. There is no point to
the middle area, so feel free to
bypass it unless you REALLY want
those plot details. The room
after that is pretty empty, just
ascend the stairs and go through
the door. The next two areas are
nothing too special, they just
have drones and turrets to
destroy. You will find yourself
in a save room with another key.
Save your game, heal Kane and go
into the boss chamber. You
already know the routine of
things and how to destroy those
roller bosses. When it is
finally destroyed, backtrack
back to the main chamber with
the doors...again.

Ah, here we are. The last path
to explore, the northeast path.
The first two rooms to explore
aren't really noteworthy. The
third one has a branching path
at the bottom of the stairs. The
left path leds to an AMMO CLIP
INCREASE for your Fermon Sniper.
The right path takes you to the
same area. The center door where
the branch is will progress you
further into the level. Beyond
the area where you picked up the
ammo increase is something much
more interesting.

Send the RAD through the vents.
This will net you another Alien
Artifact, which is probably the
last to collect. Then wrap all
of the way around to the force
orbs, one is hidden behind the
containers. Bring Kane around,
dispose of those pesky droids,
and continue on. Past the last
couple of rooms is the save room
with the boss chamber after it.
After you have taken care of the
last boss and gotten the last
data packet, backtrack to the
main chamber. Go through that
center door now that you have
all four of the proper packets.
Past the small hallway with two
red drones will be another
mechanized door. At this point
in the game you're already very
familiar with how to deal with
them. After it is defeated
Episode 10 will be over.

--------------------------------
 Episode 11: Phexic Manifold [ep
--------------------------------

This level is a boss fight, but
it is a very non-traditional
boss fight. As opposed to
controlling Kane during the
battle, you actually fight the
boss using the Remote Access
Droid. Now you might think
"What? That thing can only stun
things". But in this case, its
EMP blast inflicts real damage.
This fight requires you to
attack all three sides of boss
with your EMP. Take aim at the
obvious red weak points. The
boss has a bit of variety in its
attacks. The center side lobs
out grenades, the side to the
right (your right) fires a fast
barrage of energy projectiles
and the side to the left emits a
green laser that is both easy to
dodge and slow moving.

There really is not too much
strategy involved with this
fight. Just be quick to move the
RAD out of harm's way whenever
you can. You will have to shoot
each spot more than once, but
soon enough you'll get the job
done. The Episode will come to a
close as soon as you defeat the
boss.

--------------------------------
Episode 12: Cold Process [ep122]
--------------------------------

At the start of the level take
the Remote Access Droid into the
vents the boss left exposed
after it exploded. After you
work your way past the winding
path you'll come into an area
with a gun on a pedestal. Shoot
the two force orbs powering the
force field, move Kane into the
room, claim the Lepton Spread
and then continue on through the
door. There is an elevator in
this room that you need to take
to make it back to the surface.
When you are on the catwalk make
your way to the other side to be
taken into another part of the
Moon. Now stuff should start to
look familiar again. Examine the
map terminal to advance the plot
and to get the map data that you
need.

Past the map terminal will be an
open area with two new blue
drone types. Past this room is a
save room, do what you got to do
and keep moving. The blue room
with the round part in the
center is nothing special, just
go down the stairs and go
through the door. In the room
with the two vents, you will
want to send the RAD into the
east-side vent first, and you'll
soon see why. Make your way
through the vents, towards the
end of the path of the first
vent you will want to blast the
force orb to your left, then
quickly make it into the second
set of vents to shoot the other
one and make it possible to
claim the Alien Artifact. Shoot
the orb to the left of your
current position and then book
it though the vents. The second
orb will be on your right. Now
you can exit out of the west
side and safely meet up with
Kane. When you do this, leave
this area through the yet-
unexplored door.

In the red chamber after this
there's nothing special to do.
Now you will find yourself in a
blue room again with a force
field to your right and stairs
in front of you, there will also
be more grenade-throwing mechs
for you to deal with. Send the
RAD through the vents, you will
see the first force orb almost
right away, but the second one
is not as obvious. Hook a right
when you get a chance to. The
second orb is across the
platform, but you will have to
shoot it from afar. When you do
that, move Kane past where the
force field was and take the
ammo increase clip for the
Lepton Spread. Then regroup and
leave. There is nothing of
interest in the next three rooms
really.

After those uneventful rooms
will be a red room with a
grenade turret on the ceiling.
Dispath of the annoying drones
and the turret, then send out
the RAD under the pipes to the
right (from where you enter the
area) and disable the the two
force orbs. Move Kane past the
force field and down into a
lower area with a MAX HEALTH
INCREASE. Then backtrack and
regroup, and leave the area.

Next area has another simple RAD
puzzle to solve, and the room
after that is another save
point. What's with all of the
save points? I bet the boss is
SO intimidating! But anywho, now
you are introduced to spider
enemies that have a blue core,
these enemies are more durable
and their projectile shots are
more faster, making it difficult
to dodge them. Send out the RAD
into the vents, the path to the
next Alien Artifact is kind of
long, but soon enough you will
reach it. After you claim it,
regroup with Kane and make a
timely exit.

The next two areas aren't really
anything, but the room after
those is worth a mention. The
path is still linear twists and
turns with some drones and
walking mechs thrown into the
mix though. When you reach the
hall with the two suits standing
next to one another, use your
brand new Lepton Spread to take
care of them both with just a
couple shots. Send out the RAD
through the insanely long tunnel
path to claim the last Alien
Artifact of the Episode, then
regroup with Kane and leave the
area at once.

There honestly really isn't much
to say about the remainder of
the Episode. Past one empty
hallway will be a mechanized
door for you to defeat. After
that is done you will be
finished with Episode 12.

--------------------------------
Episode 13: Guardian III [ep133]
--------------------------------

The much-anticipated third
Guardian. I admit this one is
definitely a few steps above the
first two, but its still really
manageable. With the arsenal of
weapons that you carry with you
now it's a cinch. Just like a
previous boss fight you have to
disable the force field arond it
by examining the four
generators. As with the previous
fight it will be constantly
shooting at you and just making
life more difficult. There are
two generators near the floor of
the area, and two on the upper
level.

It does not matter which order
you turn them off, but I highly
recommend saving one of the
floor-level ones for last, this
makes it so when the force field
is deactivated you will be much
closer to the Guardian. When you
finally do get all of the
generators deactivated and you
are face to face (well, sort of)
with the boss use your Lepton
Spread and target the three red
panels on its chest to get
things kicked into motion. Once
the panels have been shot out,
that red core that you are so
familiar with will be exposed.
Even though it is close range
for this instance I advise using
the Fermon Sniper on the core.
It will deal heavy damage to the
boss. If this is not an option
the Quanta Rifle and Muon Pistol
are always a welcome substitute.
But the Super Assault Rifle
feels too awkward for this one.

You will probably have to
deactivate the force field at
least twice before you can
defeat the third Guardian. The
boss does not regenerate health
or anything, so don't fret. Soon
enough you will claim victory
and bring this Episode to a
close. Congratulations!

--------------------------------
 Episode 14: Irradiated Stratum 
--------------------------------

Well you managed to shut down
that horrible process, but a
hero's work is truly never
finished. After some more
dialogue you will be told to
download the next map from the
terminal you come across in
order to check out three points
of interest. Exit out the door
on the east side. In this first
room you will find a new weapon
to wield, the Oxid Cannon!
Beyond the room with the Oxid
Cannon is the way to another
elevator that will take you to a
map terminal. Download the map
and continue on, dispatching the
drones in this room.

In the area beyond the save
point room you wil encounter
more drones and more walking
mech suits to deal with. There
is a tunnel opening point in the
north- east side of the room.
Send your Remote Access Droid
through the long paths to claim
an Alien Artifact, then group
back together with Kane and
press onward. The next room may
prove to be a little tough.
You've got mech suits and a new
but old enemy - a scorpion. It
served as the game's first ever
boss. You kill them the same as
everything else, though be aware
of their shockwave ground
attack. Since the other door is
currently locked you have no
choice but to go up the stairs
and through that door.

The next room is nothing but an
ambush room, but beyond that is
an area with an RAD puzzle to
solve. After you have cleared
the way stand Kane by where the
force field is and send out the
droid under the pipes not too
far away. Take winding path down
to where the force orbs are at,
disable them, move Kane past the
force field and all of the way
down the stairs. Eventually you
will find a new MAX HEALTH
INCREASE. Backtrack and regroup
with the RAD, then continue on.
The next chamber is where the
first Power Cell is located, but
its heavily guarded. Use your
new Oxid Cannon on the group,
then switch to either the Quanta
Rifle or Muon Pistol to pick off
the rest. Move up the stairs and
examine the Power Cell to start
it. Then backtrack all of the
way to where you first
encountered that annoying locked
door.

You will find that the door is
no longer locked. In the save
room heal up and save your
current progress, and then keep
going. As soon as you enter the
next room you are greeted by gun
turrets and drones. You will
notice a tunnel to send your RAD
in, but ignore it for now as
that is not the correct one,
there is a force field blocking
the path. Around the stairs is a
mech suit and one of those
upgraded spider enemies for you
to take on. When you reach the
second security tunnel send the
RAD in. Near the end of the
first tunnel will be a force orb
to disable, the second one is in
the other set of tunnels. Make
your way to the Alien Artifact.
Then exit out the other series
of tunnels, you will come across
two more force orbs. Those
disable the force field blocking
the path of the first tunnel.
Regroup with Kane and leave the
area.

It seems like the aliens are out
for your blood, the next room
you will find yourself in is
more or less the same as the
past few. Clear a path and head
up the stairs through the door.
The next area is a series of
rooms to explore. Take the time
to clear all of the drones, then
place Kane near the force field.
Send out the RAD under the pipes
in the right chamber near the
start of the area and wrap your
way through the tunnel system.
The force orbs are luckily right
next to the force field. Regroup
with Kane and continue down the
stairs. Make your way past those
indestructible yellow drones and
claim the AMMO CLIP INCREASE for
the Oxid Cannon. Backtrack past
the force field and continue on.

The next room is nothing
special, but beyond that is the
chamber with the next Power Cell
to activate. Just as with the
first room, the Oxid Cannon will
prove to be your best friend,
its massive firepower will deal
damage to everyone that is
caught in its fire radius.
Examine the Power Cell to
activate it and then make your
way back to where you ascended
those second set of stairs, and
go through the previously locked
door in that room.

--------------------------------
 Episode 14: Irradiated Stratum 
--------------------------------

There is nothing noteworthy
about the room beyond the save
room, just clear the enemies and
keep moving. The next area is
very straightforward, it is just
a bunch of inter-connected rooms
with walking mech suits, drones
and spiders to destroy. Towards
the end of the room there will
be a tunnel to the left of the
exit door. Send the Remote
Access Droid through the tunnel,
you will soon make your way to
another tunnel entry point.
Toward the end of that will be
the last Alien Artifact to
claim! Regroup with Kane and
continue onward.

This next room is just two
different paths that lead to the
exact same spot, there is
nothing special about them. But
the one after that is the third
and last Power Cell chamber,
again it is heavily guarded.
When you have finally destroyed
every drone and mech suit
examine the Power Cell to
activate it. Then exit out the
other door in the room, the one
you didn't come in from.

In this next room will be your
last weapon to pick up, the
Seeker Pod! Beyond this chamber
will be a narrow walk-way for
you to take to an elevator. As
soon as you enter the elevator
the Episode will be drawn to a
close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 15: Matrix Progenitor [
--------------------------------

Snag the key that is sitting at
the bottom of the two
staircases, and then move
through the door. The next
chamber is more noteworthy. Grab
the Ammo Clip Increase for the
Seeker Pod that you just picked
up. Drop down into the main area
of the room and move forward to
being the boss fight.

Fortunately this is pretty
straightforward. Attack the top
weak points of each core panel
from afar. It is much easier to
dodge the projectiles than it is
to avoid the grenades that the
core throws out. Your Fermion
Sniper is almost like your new
best friend, it will allow you
to attack from long range so
that you can easily dodge
projectile attacks. Not to
mention it packs a strong hit.

When the core is exposed I
recommend switching to your new
Seeker Pod to test it out. Aim
directly at the core and shoo-
HOLY CRAP ITS LIKE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON! Ahem, but yeah, as you
will see it is a very powerful
weapon. Finish off the core
however you like. When it is
destroyed, Episode 15 is over.

--------------------------------
 Episode 16: Fermian Homeworld [
--------------------------------

Right off the bat you're dealing
with a roomful of enemies.
Dispatch them and exit out of
the door that is to the west of
where you started. Without map
data the exits won't be as
spoonfed to you as before. The
next two rooms are very linear
and there's nothing special
about them. But the next one
requires a little RAD-puzzle
solving. First clear the area of
all of the enemies, then move
Kane to around where the force
field is. Send the droid through
the tunnel found near the
beginning of the area. Disable
the force orbs to bring Kane in,
then regroup and continue along.

The next two rooms are again
pretty much just there for the
sake of being there and not
worth any other kind of mention.
The room after those is the same
deal, except you are introduced
to a new type of walking mech
suit - a variety that are more
durable, have a different
physical appearance, and can
cloak when they want to - either
they can cloak or my game
glitched up.

The next three rooms are all
about running and gunning. I
almost died in the third room
just because of how much
overwhelming firepower you face.
And with no save points yet if
you die you have to begin at the
start of the Episode. Moving on,
you will encounter a chamber
with some drones and one of
those mini roller bosses that
you dealt with earlier in the
game. Beyond that room are just
more mech suits to destroy and
doors to go through.

The last area is basically
empty, there are two wrapping
paths that lead to the exact
same spot, it does not matter
which route you take. When you
reach the elevator walk into it
to be taken to a new part of the
alien homeworld. This brings
Episode 16 to a close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 17: Overlord [ep177]
--------------------------------

The final level of the main game
mode. Take the key on the narrow
walkway and go through the final
door. The last boss, the
Overlord, really isn't that
hard. His weak point is his
exposed head/face area. If you
conserved your Seeker Pod and
Oxid Cannon rounds now is the
time to use them. This boss
fight is just like all of the
other ones in the sense that it
follows a distinct pattern.
After a while the Overlord will
retreat back behind a force
field, and when this happens
drones will spawn from the
security chutes. But this isn't
all bad as it allows you the
potential opportunity to pick up
some more ammo and health
canisters.

As far as attacks go, the
Overlord fires your standard
projectile shots, and it throws
grenades out. And what alien
boss fight would be complete
without the standard-issue laser
beam. The Overlord will
constantly follow you around the
area, when it's not behind a
force field anyway. The only
real difficulty of this fight
comes in with a lack of ammo for
the Seeker Pod and Oxid Cannon.
If needed you can still use your
other weapons, including the
Super Assault Rifle on the boss,
it would just take an absurd
amount of time.

It will not be too long before
you bring the Overlord down.
When this finally happens sit
back and watch the final cut-
scene. Then the credits will
roll and you will be thanked for
playing. Congratulations, you
have just beaten Moon!


--------------------------------
 VIII. Bonus Episodes [bno00]
--------------------------------

The Bonus Episodes are six
Episodes all of very short
length and with a very straight
objective that you unlock by
obtaining all three Alien
Artifacts in each episode that
has them. Each Bonus Episode is
a re-hash of a previously beaten
Episode, except with a few
cosmetic changes. Your objective
is always the same, get to Tsuke
at the end of the area.

You begin each Episode with the
map data already uploaded to
your UAC, and you get the same
basic instructions from Tsuke at
the start, all you have to do is
make it to the end of the
Episode's area to beat it. There
are no extra merits of any kind
in any of the Bonus Episodes,
and each Episode is very easy.
They really only serve to give
you more practice with the game.
You will notice that the
writeups for the six Bonus
Episodes are all noticeably
shorter than the writeups for
most of the other usual normal
levels of the game, and that is
because of how short and simple
each Episode is. But with that
being said, it is on to the
Bonus Episodes walkthrough
portion!

--------------------------------
 Episode 18: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

The first of the Bonus Episodes.
It follows a pattern that the
rest of them do, in the sense of
how simple it is. The first room
is just a giant chamber with
some drones to destroy, the
second has a spider enemy along
with some drones and gun
turrets. The next two rooms
after that are more or less the
same, but be sure to keep your
guard up - there are more drones
in the second of the two than
you might think.

The room after that has two
drones that will spawn right in
front of Kane, so deal with them
quickly. This final room is
actually a bit more tricky than
the others. Down the stairs will
be two spider enemies for you to
destroy, and in the last area
after them will be a grenade-
launching gun turret and one of
those invincible gun turrets
that alternate fire from every
other hole. Once you are past
all of that you will quickly see
Tsuke waiting for you...just
kind of standing there. Gee,
thanks for the help pal. That
will bring the first training
episode to a close.

--------------------------------
 Episode 19: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

Feel free to make a mad dash for
the exit door when you find
yourself in the first chamber's
room. As there is nothing else
of interest except for several
drones to destroy on either side
of yourself. The second area is
a familiar winding path of empty
space and drone-filled space. Be
way of the security chutes you
pass, as drones will eventually
spawn from them and catch up
with Kane.

The third room only has drones
and a blue-core colored spider
enemy to deal with, and the exit
is located in the southeast
region of the area. After that
area is a small narrow hallway
that just leads to another door.
The chamber beyond that one may
seem like it has a Remote Access
Droid puzzle for you to solve,
but the reality in fact is, it
really does not. There is only
one of two force orbs that you
need to disable around you. The
second one is literally no where
else to be found. I guess they
just forgot to finish this level
or they could not afford to
finish it. Either way, move on.

The area after that just sees
you making your way to another
door. Following it though, is an
area with a very familiar Remote
Access Droid puzzle for you to
solve. Just send out the droid
through the tunnel and disable
the force orbs so that Kane can
move into the area some more.
Regroup Kane and your Remote
Access Droid together to bring
this Episode to an end.

--------------------------------
 Episode 20: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

The first big area you will find
yourself in is simply a narrow
hallway that connects to a wider
room with those indestructible
gun turrets and more drones to
prove bothersome to you, there
is not much else to say about
that really. Beyond that space
is a chamber with a spider enemy
and the first appearance of
walking mech suits in these
Bonus Episodes. You will also
encounter one of those really
annoying plasma turrets.

After that is another simple
winding path for you to run and
gun while getting to the area
exit point. After that will be
the final room. And all that is
standing between you and
Tsukigami are a handful of
drones that you will easily be
able to dispatch. You will find
Tsuke on the east side of the
room's area.

--------------------------------
 Episode 21: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

The first two rooms in this
Episode are nothing but shooting
drones and going through doors,
yay. The third one requires you
to solve a Remote Access Droid
puzzle. Send out your robot
either side under the pipes. Be
aware of all the droids in the
area though. Disable the two
force orbs, then move Kane in
and take out those bothersome
drones. Reclaim your RAD and
continue on through the door.

Now we will start to see more
Remote Access Droid puzzles in
use. The next area has another
one to solve. Stand Kane in
front of the force field and
send out your droid under the
pipes. The two force orbs that
you need to disable with the EMP
blaster are located in the two
rooms directly next to the room
with the force field. Disable
them and bring Kane in. Then
regroup and enter the next area.

The area after that has another
RAD puzzle, but it is both near
the end of the level and very
easy to solve, just send the
droid under the pipes and
disable the orbs, the force
field is generated right next to
that position. Take Kane and
your droid into the next room.

One more puzzle stands between
you and the exit. This one
actually takes some luck and
almost near-perfect timing. The
two force orbs are located in
the southwest corner (first row
from the top on the very left)
and on the very bottom south-
hallway. There's a trick to it
of sorts. The first time you
turn them off you have to move
Kane past the force field. Then
the second time you have to haul
robot butt and get your Remote
Access Droid through the the
other side as well. If you do
not get the first time, don't
sweat it. Its tricky but still
very easy, so no worries. In the
next room you'll meet up with
Tsuke and that will bring this
Episode to a close. In case
you're wondering why you need to
make two deactivating trips its
because with the time it takes
to switch to Kane and pick up
your RAD there won't be enough
time to get you both through in
time before the force field goes
back up.

--------------------------------
 Episode 22: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

The first area is pure running
and gunning, be wary of the
ceiling turret. If you do not
take care of it soon enough it
can rip Kane to shreds. Around
the stairs will be a mech suit
waiting for you, so be sure to
have something like your Oxid
Cannon ready. The room after
this is pretty straightforward,
that run and gun sense is still
present. The path itself is very
linear and full of twists and
turns.

The next chamber is very odd,
for the sole reason that there
seems to be red projectiles that
emit from the ground. There is
no enemy that fires them, they
just emerge from the ground. Its
really weird. This is where I
began to wonder just how much
this game was finished before
they sold it. This single
chamber is the ONLY place where
you will witness something like
this in the entire game. But
anyway, just destroy all of the
drones and enter the next area.
Just be sure to watch out for
the mysterious firing
projectiles!

Finally, in the very last room
just make your fastest dash for
the exit. Be wary of the walking
mech suits and drones that you
will encounter. But really, it
is all a cinch. Tsuke is in the
northeast region of the area.

--------------------------------
 Episode 23: Tsukigami's VR Trai
--------------------------------

The first serious chamber you
find yourself in contains a
carbon copy of that Remote
Access Droid puzzle with the gun
turrets from Episode 01. Use the
same exact strategy for this one
too. Disable the force orbs,
move Kane in and put him in
front of the second force field,
out of harm's way. Then repeat
the processs for the second
force field. Regroup your RAD
with Kane and then move on to
the next room.

As soon as you enter this room
you are greeted with a force orb
and two tunnels to send your RAD
in. The one on the right is
absolutely useless, the force
field it deactivates is entirely
ignored. So send your droid
through the left tunnel. The
force orb that you have to
disable will be directly above
you on the wall adjacent to
where you come out of the
tunnel. Switch to Kane, make
very short work of the mech
suits, then take your RAD and
continue on through the door at
the bottom of the steps, making
sure to either destroy or ignore
the mech suit waiting there for
you.

The last chamber is very
straigtforward. The first thing
you should do is make sure to
clear all of the drones and gun
turrets, then put Kane in front
of the force field. Send out
your RAD through the tunnel.
When you exit the first tunnel
turn around, you'll see the lone
force orb that you have to
destroy. Take the time to move
Kane past where the force field
generates, and switch to the RAD
again and continue your journey
through the next tunnel. You
will, very conveniently, come
out right where Kane is
standing. Regroup and wrap
around the path to where Tsuke
is waiting for you.
Congratulations, you just
completed the very last Bonus
Episode in Moon!

 IX. Frequently Asked Questions 
--------------------------------

The following section is
dedicated for pieces of
information that I felt did not
warrant their own section in the
main guide, for one reason or
another. It is also a source for
the answers to some common
questions you may have about the
game.

Q: Is there Nintendo Wifi
support for this game? A: Sadly,
no. Which really baffles me.

Q: How can I play multiplayer
with my friends? A: You cannot,
Moon is a single player game
only.

Q: How many different game modes
are there? A: Just the single
adventure mode, and quick play

Q: Which is better, this game or
Metroid Prime Hunters? A:
Everyone is entitled to their
own personal opinion, so there
is no right answer. Personally
as I stated earlier, I have
never played Metroid Prime
Hunters, so I cannot really
answer that question.


Q: Is there anyway to disable
use of the stylus? A: I'm afraid
there is not, you're stuck with
using the stylus. But trust me,
you get used to it with
practice!

Q: Who are the main characters
in the game? A: Major Edward
Scott Kane, the reluctant hero
of the game. A guy who was just
doing his job before the poop
hit the fan. You play as him.
General Lillian Lincoln Lambert,
Kane's superior officer who
brought him along when she
discovers a mysterious structure
on the Moon, who seems to know
more than what she lets on. And
Captain Kado Tsukigami, Kane's
best friend who was hand picked
by General Lambert to assist
you. He is very experienced in
combat and manages to keep a
cool head when the pressure is
on. Kane refers to him as
"Tsuke" during the game.

Q: How do I earn all of the
Merits in a level? A: In order
to earn every Merit that you can
possible get in an Episode, you
need to collect any weapons that
can be found in them, as well
all three Alien Artifacts, the
Ammo Clip Increase pick up, and
the Max Health Increase pick up.
The final stipulation is
something that a lot of people
tend to miss, including yours
truly. You must ALSO take the
time to examine every computer
terminal in a level. Not the map
terminals, the ones that provide
log data from whoever used them
last. So they not only serve to
fill you in on plot details,
they are also there for the
perfectionists of the game.

Q: Which Episodes have Alien
Artifacts for me to collect? A:
Episodes 01, 04, 08, 10, 12, and
14.

 X. Version History [ver00]
--------------------------------

February 13th, 2009 - 0.15:
Initial submission of the guide.
Just about every section of the
guide needs to be updated. As
far as the walkthrough goes, I
wrote up the strategy for the
Prologue and Episode 02 sections
- anyone else can notice that
Episode 01 is missing. I
intentionally did this, but rest
easy and assured I will include
the write up for that and many
other sections with the next
update to the guide.

February 20th, 2009 - 0.16:
Updated the main walkthrough
section to finally include
Episode 01, Episode 03, Episode
04, and Episode 05.

February 23rd, 2009 - 0.17:
Updated the main walkthrough
section again to include the
strategy guides for Episode 06
and Episode 07. I meant to get
more done over the weekend but
it just quite simply did not
happen. I would say the guide is
still coming along nicely
though, just not at the same
pace I would prefer. I do intend
to keep chipping away at the
guide as this week before my
Spring Break progresses. Thank
you for all of the emails I've
been getting.

Febuary 24th, 2009 - 0.42:
Massive update to the guide.
Every section saw an update. The
walkthrough section saw Episodes
08-13 being written up for. I
should be able to finish her by
the beginning of Spring Break
weekend.

March 1st, 2009 - 1.00: Another
massive update to the entire
guide. I updated every single
section and decided to split
section 2 into three different
parts, I decided that it would
be easier to allocate those
pieces of information their own
section. I also added the Bonus
Episodes section and the
walkthrough for each of those
levels. All in all, the entire
FAQ/Walkthrough is now
officially complete. I can close
the book on her. ffmasterjose's
